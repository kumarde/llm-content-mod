He is probably not clear on the scope of this mission beyond the fact that he has been chosen to redeem the German people and reshape Europe. Just how this is to be accomplished is also rather vague in his mind, but this does not concern him greatly because an ""inner voice"" communicates to him the steps [Page 10] he is to take. This is the guide which leads him on his course with the precision and security of a sleep-walker.

> chosen by God to be the New Deliverer of Germany and the Founder of a new social order for the world. He firmly believes this and is certain that in spite of all the trials and tribulations through which he must pass he will finally attain that goal. The one condition is that he follow the dictates of the inner voice which have guided and protected him in the past. This conviction is not rooted in the truth of the ideas he imparts but is based on the conviction of his own personal greatness. (146) Howard K. Smith makes an interesting observation:

Have read mind kampf, which obviously you haven't because it's basically a major key to even being able to understand anything you read in that book in depth.

>Adolf Hitler, the new Chancellor of Germany, had no intention of abiding by the rules of democracy. He intended only to use those rules to legally establish himself as dictator as quickly as possible then begin the Nazi revolution.

>Carrying incendiary devices, he spent all day lurking around the building, before breaking in around 9 p.m. He took off his shirt, lit it on fire, then went to work using it as his torch.

The exact sequence of events will never be known, but Nazi storm troopers under the direction of Göring were also involved in torching the place. They had befriended the arsonist and may have known or even encouraged him to burn the Reichstag that night. The storm troopers, led by SA leader Karl Ernst, used the underground tunnel that connected Göring's residence with the cellar in the Reichstag. They entered the building, scattered gasoline and incendiaries, then hurried back through the tunnel.

The male officer has been suspended, according to the report, thank god.  
http://thefreethoughtproject.com/video-sitting-porch-beaten-police-state/#vQHOKzj2IwUvhuuy.99﻿

""Greensboro, NC — In the American police state, sitting on your own porch in broad daylight, doing nothing untoward, could still earn a punch in the face and tackling to the ground by an ignorant, rogue cop — even if you’re fully compliant and respectful.

Dejuan Yourse found that out the hard way on June 17, when he waited for his mom to meet him at the Greensboro, North Carolina, house he’d intermittently shared with her for years. Because he did not have a current key to the home, Yourse’s mother told him to relax on the porch until she arrived.

Officer Travis Cole and an as-yet unidentified female officer, however, pulled up before she got there, and proceeded to harass, intimidate, insult, and ultimately brutalize Yourse — on his own front porch — for literally no reason.

Body camera footage revealed the male officer’s unjustified “disturbing” excessive force, and — although far too many similar incidents go unpunished — this time, video led to some semblance of justice.

Although the encounter begins cordially enough — the officers politely ask basic investigatory questions after being summoned to the scene by someone unfamiliar with Yourse who had assumed it was a case of breaking and entering — the tension escalates quickly, thanks to Cole’s assumption the man must be lying. Were it not for the costumes and badges of the police, the startling encounter would constitute pure thuggery.""

"Many argue that the type of mercury found in vaccines, ethyl mercury via thimerosal, is not as toxic as methyl mercury. Dr. George Lucier, Toxicologist and Former Director of the Environmental Toxicology Program at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), clearly shows that thimerosal, ethyl mercury, is a developmental neurotoxicant and exposure to it holds the same dangers as methyl mercury. Dr. George Lucier has coordinated toxicology research and testing for many Federal agencies including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, (EPA), the Food and Drug Administration, (FDA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations, (OSHA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (CDC).

Summary of report on thimerosal: The vaccine preservative, thimerosal contains 50% ethylmercury. Its structural analog methylmercury, is a potent and well known developmental neurotoxin and substantial evidence exists that ethylmercury is also a developmental neurotoxin. Based on studies that mercury reaches the brain after thimerosal or ethylmercury exposure, the knowledge that the amount of ethylmercury in vaccines exceeds safe levels and the results from a number of health effects and mechanism studies, it is highly probable that the use of thimerosal as a preservative has caused developmental disorders, including autism, in some children. All opinions expressed herein are based on a reasonable degree of scientific certainty using the information contained in the attached bibliography. I may also rely on my review of the testimonies of others at the trial. Illustrations used at three of my presentations on alkylmercury and thimerosal toxicity have previously been provided to the defendants.

"At the risk of going too meta, there *is* a weird vibe to r/conspiracy, though I keep coming back.

One thing is the pretty much constant negativity in each and every comments section. I understand that most people would not browse this sub if they didn't harbor some sort of basic distrust of the system, and some anger at the way things are. But what's upsetting is that that same level of anger is projected against almost everyone that is disagreed with. I don't usually generalize, and I try not to feed the trolls or let past experiences color my view of a particular topic, but the negativity is something that is pretty much constantly present here. It's *very* possible that there are droves of malicious trolls and shills here, or that a lot of people are inspired by this Alex-Jonesish mockery of everything they disagree with. I just like exploring the unknown, and if this is where reddit does that, then count me in, but it certainly is frustrating. Doesn't have to be here, but I would like to see a conspiracy sub run like r/science, where comments at least have to stay on topic, and not include ad hominem insults against other users, snide remarks or the like.

Another observation is that this sub is almost solely about politics and political conspiracy. I like keeping up with Assange, and Snowden, but stories like that do get a lion's share of upvoting here. The Hillary/Trump stuff is really big here, and anything 9/11. But it's so interesting, that this sub can upvote a 9/11 conspiracy post just about any day, but you will hardly EVER find anything about FEMA camps, UFOs, Illuminati, Men In Black, occult, etc taken seriously. I know those conspiracies have much less concrete proof than something like 9/11, but it's frustrating because most of the one-topic conspiracy subs are really small and get very little exposure. Again, I'm not really making value judgments out of this, just observations. Maybe the shills in this sub are happy to have us discuss a certain list of topics they can't manage to suppress while no one notices if the rest get downvoted before they get started. Idk. 

*All that said* it was this sub that broke the Combetta cover-up, involving realtime collaboration and research between redditors of this sub.

Also, I'm very much considering cloth pads as well (even if they're just to use while getting use to the cup) but from some reviews I've read on Amazon, a few people mention that they seem to make them sweat more and also that they aren't as absorbent as disposable pads.

..But the only way we can get things done is by having millions of people coming together. If we want free tuition at public colleges and universities, millions of young people are going to have to demand it, and give the Republicans an offer they can't refuse.
