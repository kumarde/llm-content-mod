L: And a volcano's eruption is plausibly linked to changes in pressure?

S: Yes.

L: And you were drilling with the specific intent of altering pressure, correct?

S: Yes.

L: So you started an untested, experimental procedure that was intended to alter the pressure within the system with knowledge that it was at least possible that you could trigger an eruption/

S: Yes.

L: And now 250,000 people are dead and over $90 billion dollars in infrastructure damaged/destroyed, correct?

S: Yes.

L: And the eruption started after your drill hit 1 km underground, correct?

S: Yes.

L: Did you have any reasonable evidence, or even tested theories that this wasn't going to happen?

S: No.

L: But you proceeded anyway?

S: Yes.

L: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we ask that you find that this group of individuals be held liable for the damage and deaths that were caused by an eruption that by their own admission could have been triggered by their activities. There was no evidence that the volcano was at imminent risk of erupting so there was no imperative to rush into this untested and untried process, and as soon as they had performed their drill an eruption *did* in fact occur without warning.

Of course, humanity still hasn't agreed on what rights to give ourselves, much less unborn fetuses and other animals, so I know there's never gonna be just one answer. But different systems at least already acknowledge a variety of not-quite-human rights at different levels.

For example, my state recently became the first US state to criminalize animal abuse and neglect. Were someone to intentionally inflict pain on an animal or neglect it's basic needs to food, water, standard veterinary care, space, cleanliness, some level of privacy and silence etc., they would be breaking the law. At what point do we protect AI in the same way? I'm guessing when they're capable of feeling pain? How will we know? Is that a trait we would have to program into them or something they're likely to evolve on their own eventually?

I've also wondered how AI rights might compare to fetal rights. Even where abortion is legal, they are owed a certain right to life (eg killing by anyone but the pregnant parent is illegal) and medical providers still owe the standard of care/do no harm, but parents do not owe them life support if they choose not to.

">Essentially, Wong says, the study revealed that women are compensated for adhering to widely accepted social norms. She finds this fascinating.

>Penner believes the phenomenon they uncovered could be linked to an overarching societal desire to exert power over the female form. To my mind, it goes back to a larger set of issues around how we sort of seek to control women’s bodies,” he says.

Is that really an expression of a *male* desire to ""control women’s bodies"", or is that a big ideological imposition on the study by its authors?

We often hear that women dress primarily to impress other women - and in personal, anecdotal experience, that's true. Women don't worry about what the men in a group will think, but what the other women will think. They may dress to have an impact on a *particular* man, but only a very small number of women dress to have an effect on men *in general* - but most do dress to have an effect on women in general rather than particular. The ""school gate"" is a place where such intra-gender rivalry can be seen very clearly, and the men are basically irrelevant. ""Bien coiffé"" as a concept has nothing to do with men at all.

Men, on the other hand, rarely compete with other men through grooming at all. Again, for a man to do so is frankly a bit weird.

For those reasons, bad grooming is a more significant indicator for women than for men, I would say. It shows someone who is opting out of her gender's status competition - and that pay in a market environment (hence competitive) should follow seems logical, because you're looking at someone who is either a poor competitor or a drop-out.",science,1

"Study: [Enceladus' and Dione's floating ice shells supported by minimum stress isostasy](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070650/abstract)
___


&gt;**Abstract**:

&gt;Enceladus' gravity and shape have been explained in terms of a thick isostatic ice shell floating on a global ocean, in contradiction of the thin shell implied by librations. Here we propose a new isostatic model minimizing crustal deviatoric stress, and demonstrate that gravity and shape data predict a 38 ± 4km-thick ocean beneath a 23 ± 4km-thick shell agreeing with – but independent from – libration data. Isostatic and tidal stresses are comparable in magnitude. South polar crust is only 7 ± 4km thick, facilitating the opening of water conduits and enhancing tidal dissipation through stress concentration. Enceladus' resonant companion, Dione, is in a similar state of minimum stress isostasy. Its gravity and shape can be explained in terms of a 99 ± 23km-thick isostatic shell overlying a 65 ± 30km-thick global ocean, thus providing the first clear evidence for a present-day ocean within Dione.",science,0

"&gt; Genes have been identified which may be associated with the development of human-directed social behaviours in dogs, according to a study in Scientific Reports this week. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified two regions in the genome of beagles, containing a total of five genes, which may be associated with behaviours such as attention seeking, and remaining in close proximity to humans.

&gt;Per Jensen and colleagues recorded the propensity of laboratory beagles, bred, kept and handled under standardized conditions, to initiate physical interactions with humans during an unsolvable-problem task. In this task, the dogs had to slide three lids open in order to obtain treats in the containers underneath. However, one of the lids had been fixed in place and could not be opened. The authors recorded if the dogs engaged in any human-directed social behaviours as a result of this ‘unsolvable’ task, such as seeking eye contact with humans.

&gt;The genomes of 190 of these beagles were then analysed and the authors identified two genomic regions containing a total of five candidate genes which may be associated with human-directed social behaviours. The study revealed a genetic marker within the gene SEZ6L which was associated with time spent close to, and in physical contact with, humans. Two suggestive markers located within the gene ARVCF, were also associated with human-contact-seeking.

&gt;The authors note that additional studies are required to further validate their current results.
