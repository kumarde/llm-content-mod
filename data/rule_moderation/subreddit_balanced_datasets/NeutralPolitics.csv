The top comment in particular is egregious. I have a few basic questions that I feel should be answered but can't find a single damn person here or anywhere else who brings them up.

1) What is the difference between a hack and a leak, were these hacks or leaks? As far as I can tell there is a great range of opinion on this, and it seems very important. 
2) What exactly was hacked/leaked by whom? As far as I understand there are DNC hacks/leaks, Podesta email hacks/leaks, Clinton server hacks/leaks, Weiner hacks/leaks etc. Why don't people differentiate when discussing these? What exactly is the CIA claiming to have been hacked by the Russians?
3) Was the RNC actually hacked and IF so how does this have any connection to Trump? Was the RNC hacked before he was the nominee or after? Was it the national RNC or simply the Illinois RNC as some sources are claiming? Would withholding information on the RNC really help Trump (considering the two groups were at odds for so long? How is it that NOBODY is considering this. It really is absurd.
4) Were these supposed hacks of PUBLIC or PRIVATE servers? Is it the US government that was hacked or simply private entities (RNC/DNC). To me this is incredibly important particularly when people begin throwing around terms like treason.
5) Is there ANY proof of Trump being hacked - by this, I mean is the CIA/NSA/FBI investigating Trump being hacked? Is there ANY investigation ongoing into Trump's connection with Putin? Please do not link to some blog shit like I saw on /r/politics.

To refine this a little: Some laws require a certain level of intent. Generally, from greatest to least, possible intent requirements are:

Intentionally

Knowingly

Recklessly

Negligently/Carelessly

Strict Liability (No intent required).

Some things are only illegal if you did them with the intent of X happening.  Some things are illegal if you were reckless about the possibility of X happening. And some things are illegal if X ended up happening, regardless of whether you had any intent of that happening.

The summary here is that the FBI is saying ""X happened, but we have no evidence that anyone intended for X to happen, and in this particular instance it's only a crime if someone intended for X to happen. So we're not recommending any charges.""

"**TL;DR:**  Type in ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ for proper formatting

Actual reply:

For the 

    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

like you were trying for you need three backslashes, so it should look like this when you type it out

    ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

which will turn out like this

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

The reason for this is that the underscore character (this one \_ ) is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does (this guy \* ).  Since the ""face"" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the ""face"" (this guy (ツ) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first ""\\_"" is just saying ""hey, I don't want to italicize (ツ)"" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol

***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***

Edit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \_italicize\_ or \*italicize\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\_italicize\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\\\_/¯ but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.",NeutralPolitics,1

"So I was originally going to dryly present a case with citations and leave it at that, but unfounded contrarianism really riles me up. So I'm going to break down these contrasting theories in a less dry fashion.

The prevailing, mainstream theory regarding these hacks and leaks is as follows:

> State-sponsored hackers based in Russia are responsible for hacking the DNC and leaking its private files to the public via the WikiLeaks organization in an attempt to harm the Clinton presidential campaign as a vector for advancing Russian political interests. This hacking group is attempting to divert blame from Russia by posing as an independent group of hacktivists.

This theory is corroborated by the following:

* Private cybersecurity firms strongly believe the DNC hackers are Russian state actors
* Mainstream media outlets report that US intelligence officials believe that the DNC hackers are Russian state actors.
* The Director of National Intelligence warned that foreign hackers (though not necessarily state-sponsored) were targeting certain presidential campaigns two months before the hacks occurred.
* The DNC and Clinton campaign have been the only organizations targeted and/or significantly harmed by these hacks/leaks. The Trump campaign, among other campaigns, has not been targeted or harmed.
* Mainstream media outlets reported that Russian hackers were responsible for the hacks a day before an independent hacktivist group claimed responsibility.
* One month after Russian hackers were reported to have compromised DNC servers, WikiLeaks leaks the raw data that was coincidentally part of the same servers compromised by the June hack.
* WikiLeaks is founded and run by a person with direct connections to the Russian government and possessing a blatant anti-Western political agenda.
* The political candidate harmed by these hacks/leaks has been antagonistic with Russia in the past, while the political candidate who benefited from these hacks/leaks has delivered a great deal of favorable pro-Russian rhetoric and political positions.

These factors, while circumstantial, all line up, and are backed/reported by several independent organizations from different sectors.

The contrarian theory is as follows:

> There is a conspiracy between the DNC, Clinton presidential campaign, mainstream media outlets, private cybersecurity firms, and potentially even government intelligence officials to discredit information hacked from the DNC and leaked by independent hacktivist organizations, and to downplay the significance of this raw data available to the public.

This theory is corroborated by the following:

* Metadata can be fabricated by professional hackers
* No ""smoking gun"" connecting Russia to the hacks has been released, and therefore all evidence pointing to Russia as the culprit is circumstantial at best and wildly speculative at worst
* Conversations within the leaked e-mails show that DNC employees were biased against Bernie Sanders's candidacy
* Conversations with the leaked e-mails show that DNC employees were in contact with mainstream media outlets
* Mainstream media outlets are widely believed to be unreliable and biased toward the Democrats, Hillary Clinton in particular
* WikiLeaks is trustworthy because they oppose the US government, and the US government is widely believed to be corrupt
* The DNC and Clinton campaign have a motive to discredit the leaks by poisoning the well (despite that the raw data is publicly available for anyone to view and draw conclusions)

And so, I will provide counter-arguments to the contrarian theory:

* Claims that the metadata used to pin the blame on Russia is fabricated is not falsifiable. Or at least, if it is, it has not even been considered a possibility by cybersecurity professionals to the point that no evidence has been deemed necessary to release to disprove this claim.
* A ""smoking gun"" connecting Russia to the hacks will not be released anytime soon, likely because doing so would compromise national intelligence-gathering and counter-intelligence efforts.
* DNC employees had reason to be biased against Sanders's candidacy, and proof of personal bias is not proof of rigging numerous public votes.
* Contact between major political organizations and major mainstream media outlets is not unusual.
* The contrarian view that mainstream media outlets are unreliable and biased is itself the product of other media outlets or low-information speculation. Discounting information because of its source is literally what this conspiracy theory is arguing.
* The view that WikiLeaks is implicitly trustworthy ignores evidence that Assange has a pro-Russian political bias.
* The DNC/Clinton campaign do indeed have this motive, but motive does not mean guilt is certain. Anti-Clinton outlets have a motive to discredit mainstream media outlets reporting Russian involvement, but that does not make them guilty of being conspirators to hack the DNC.
* The notion that private professional security firms, mainstream media outlets, and even government officials came to the same conclusion because of corruption and political conspiracy is laughable fantasy at worst and unfounded speculation at best. Numerous organizations with differing motivations don't collaborate easily, and any sinister conspiracy would undoubtedly be uncovered within a rather short period of time.

Now, I will admit that this exercise is very guilty of the Strawman logical fallacy, because I am essentially arguing against what I *perceive* the contrarian theory to be. However, in my defense I make the claim that no real evidence - circumstantial or empirical - has been advanced to support this implicit accusation of conspiracy.",NeutralPolitics,1

"First, this is not a 'result' of Obama's pivot to Asia.  This was going on long before that.  The pivot is a 'result' of increasing aggression in the pacific. 

What's happening is this: For the last couple decades, the US has been *the* global superpower, and western ways of doing things has dominated the global common spaces and global politics.  Currently, two other nations, Russia and China, are seeking to increase their influence globally.  To do so, they are challenging the current western norms of, for example, uses of the seas, respecting foreign borders, and others as they see benefit.  As they do this more to 'exert their power' they pump into the natural reaction of western powers seeking to preserve their newly established norms. 

For example, there are legal ways ot resolve claims in the South China Sea.  China is ignoring them and trying to take sea space by coercion because (and this is their words), ""China is a big country and the others (Philippians, Malaysia, etc) are small countries"" so China gets to do what they want in their mind.

"Insurance companies.

Basically a society has to decide ""Do we let sick people die, or do we help them even if they can't pay""

As soon as you say ""no we're gonna help everyone regardless of whether they can pay"" which the US has and most countries do, it becomes about the most efficient way to do things.

Insurance companies are big bureaucratic institutions who's job is to redistribute risk among people. Everyone pays their 5$ and when that 1% chance of 500$ expense comes up, you get the money you need. But if a society has already decided that everyone is covered and everyone who can needs to pay, these giant redistribution systems which figure out where to spend money, who owes what, and how to pay everything aren't necessary. It's this giant extra payment system which basically marks up all of healthcare 20%, but it could very easily be rolled into the already existent bureaucracy that is the tax system in order to make the payments and the pay outs.

Add to this all the extra things it allows (Epi Pen mark ups being a good example), and then the profit driven pharmaceutical and medical industries which lobby the US government to protect profits and you have a hugely bloated system that costs far more than is needed.

In general the United States government is very much so fair sale and the systemic corruption that flows throughout it needs to be fixed in order to save a lot of money in a lot of areas.

The US is a very large country and very countries are difficult to keep uncorrupt and democratic. On top of which the way the US's democracy works is incredibly convoluted and poor and a recipe for gridlock and partisan corruption.

"It is widely recognized as a genocide by genocide scholars though. There is no real scholarly issue or debate, most genocide scholars agree it is a genocide, there is a pretty big consensus. There is one person you could maybe consider a sorry excuse for a genocide scholar who denies the Armenian genocide, Guenter Lewy, but he is a Holocaust survivor and Jewish supremacist who denies the Nazi genocidal intentions against the gypsies, that Native Americans suffered a genocide, he whitewashed American atrocities against Vietnamese. Basically Lewy is a rare type of Holocaust exclusivists who thinks any other type of suffering or genocide competes, so the asshole that he is, denies every genocide that didn't happen to Jews. The Turkish government didn't need to convince him of much to help with their denial of the Armenian genocide. But most genocide scholars and Jews also wash their hands with the likes of Lewy. 

The issue is that the Turkish government interferes in history in Turkey by creating official positions that the ultra-nationalist Turkish population and scholars parrot. Turkey tries to do the same abroad especially in the United States by funding chairs of Ottoman and modern Turkish history and having Turkish embassies and scholars try to micro-manage scholars who are willing to be corrupted:

>http://www.alternet.org/story/87223/u.s._politicians_and_scholars_are_helping_turkey_cover_up_wwi_armenian_genocide   

>In 1982, the government of Turkey donated $3 million to create the Institute for Turkish Studies, a nonprofit organization housed at Georgetown University that pushes a pro-Turkey agenda, including denial of the Armenian genocide. Three years later, in 1985, Turkey bought full-page advertisements in The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Washington Times to publish a letter questioning the Armenian genocide that was signed by 69 American scholars. All 69 had received funding that year from the Institute for Turkish Studies or another of Turkey's surrogates like the Ankara Chamber of Commerce, a quasi-governmental agency in Turkey's capital city.

>The Institute for Turkish Studies has since received sizable donations from American defense contractors that sell arms to Turkey, including General Dynamics and Westinghouse. Turkey continues to provide an annual subsidy to support the institute. In 2006, the most recent year for which tax records are available, the institute awarded $85,000 in grants to scholars. Its chairman is the current Turkish ambassador to the U.S., Nabi Sensoy.

The chair of the board of the Institute of Turkish Studies, which is based at Georgetown University, resigned at the end of 2006, and he says he was given a choice by Turkish officials of either quitting or seeing the funding for the institute go away.

>* In an interview, Quataert said that after his review was published, he was told by David C. Cuthell, director of the institute, that people in Turkey were upset about his use of the word genocide and that he should call the Turkish ambassador.

>* Based on his experience, Quataert said that it is ""a very difficult question"" to consider whether the institute at this point has credibility as a source of financing for research and education. ""By forcing my resignation, the Turkish government has made very clear that there are bounds beyond which people cannot go,"" he said.
 
What ignorants like you attribute to scholarly debate on the issue of whether or there not was an Armenian genocide, is scholars biased by the considerable funding and interference the Turkish government tries to create in American institutions of higher learning. Let us not forget the Heath Lowry affair also:  

>https://pen.org/nonfiction/professional-ethics-and-denial-armenian-genocide

>It has been said that gentlemen do not read other gentlemen’s mail. But suppose that one[genocide scholar Robert Jay Lifton] receives a letter from the Turkish ambassador to the United States rebuking one’s scholarship because one has written about what the ambassador refers to as “the so-called ‘Armenian genocide,’ allegedly perpetrated by the Ottoman Turks during the First World War.” And suppose that, inadvertently, the envelope also contains an internal memorandum written by the executive director of what claims to be a non­political, scholarly institute[Heath Lowry, then executive director of the Institute for Turkish Studies] and that memorandum reveals much about the mentality of those who engage in denial of the Armenian genocide. What then?

tl:dr; A genocide scholar, Robert Jay Lifton published a book ""The Nazi Doctors, Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide,"" where he attested there was an Armenian genocide and op-cited alot of the work of the Armenian-American scholar Vahakn Dadrian, since the Armenian genocide is not his field(which is most scholars do outside their primary field, cite other specialists who they deem credible). Nuzhet Kandemir, then Turkish ambassador in Washington sent a letter to Lifton in 1990 objecting to the coverage of the Armenian genocide in his book. Thankfully the idiot Turkrabian ambassador also accidentally also sent Robert Lifton a letter that Heath Lowry(Atatürk Professor of Ottoman and Modern Turkish Studies and then head of the Institute of Turkish studies) sent to the Kandemir that included the same draft letter that the Turkish ambassador pretended to write and very forthright talk about how to deny the Armenian genocide!

Obama *personally* was committed to progress on AGW but he was never able to persuade the US government to deal with it.

Now that he leaves office *because he failed to even ask* the US government to commit, and because there were no commitments by the US government, it is now all up to Trump.

Flooding I believe causes death mostly for the poor who choose to live in a flood plain because they are poor. We know where the flood plains are. The floods could be a meter or so deeper.

>>Specifically, Hillary Clinton does not hold press conferences. That doesn’t mean she doesn’t speak to the press — she’s done lots of interviews — but she doesn’t stand up, on or off camera, in front of the traveling Clinton campaign press corps and take questions in an unscripted setting. She sits down with selected journalists for formal interviews, but doesn’t engage in on the record give-and-take with the slew of campaign reporters whose jobs are to follow her around every day. And you can tell from the subtext of these complaints that she’s not exactly popping by the back of the bus to shoot the breeze off-the-record style, either.

I will start with poverty, because it's become such an absurd shibboleth lately.  Whatever the effect poverty has on learning, it's largely irrelevant to the question of how to organize the schools.  Schools exist, are organized and teach in one way out of many possible ways.  some of those ways are better than others.  It might very well be that poverty is a bigger problem than bad schools (it isn't, but it's not a theoretical impossibility), but even if that's true it doesn't absolves shitty schools that teach poorly from being shitty.  Schools can do better.  crying poverty, unless your plan is to spend less money on schools and more on anti-poverty efforts, is deflecting blame, it's not a solution.  It's a way for teachers and schools to excuse their bad results and mismanagement.

As for autonomy, that works great with bright, motivated students, the sort of people who eventually get their masters degrees.  It's terrible for anyone who isn't that.  Again, it's a way to make the teachers' job more interested and deflect blame when they fail.  Getting students to take ownership of their results as a form of motivation is good, but that's not giving them autonomy, it's just a clever way of constructing a system of control.   And that's a good thing, children, by definition, need control, but bad students aren't going to magically transform if you let them do what they feel like.  ",NeutralPolitics,1

"This should be higher as this is the good answer.

In Europe, it all began in West Germany, as war losers, they weren't in the line to develop nuclear weapons whereas France and UK were running to close the gap. Then, came civilian nuclear electricity. Most countries went with the uranium pipeline rather than the thorium pipeline because plutonium is involved and it creates synergies between civilian and military technologies, allowing to reduce the burden of the military budget by having a profitable civilian application.

This is why the peace movement started to be anti nuclear. It had nothing to do with cancer or waste management. If it was good for the military budget, it was bad for mankind. There was also the issue of proliferation, several third world countries were trying to do uranium enrichment to produce plutonium and proliferation was easier through civilian technologies than classified military technologies.

Then, as Cold War was ending, you had Chernobyl. And the environment movement exploded in the 70s, with people having less tolerance for various kinds of pollutions. The nuclear apocalypse wasn't sexy anymore, so it all became an issue of Chernobyl style apocalypse, the invisible enemy trying to kill you.

25 years later, Fukushima had very limited consequences, climate change is the new real apocalypse threat, coal air pollution is killing millions. But in the mindset of the Greens, nuclear is the number one enemy. So when the Greens of Germany succeed in closing 15% of nuclear electricity while Germany is still making 45% with coal and 25% with gas ... well ... everyone applauses.

The new trend is beef based methane. The vegan/animal rights part of the Greens are fighting beef production in the name of climate change. Methane has an intense effect but disappears after a few decades, the beef base methane from the 1950s disappeared, it isn't a threat because it doesn't accumulate. CO2 remains up there for 1000 years, making it much like nuclear waste, but worse as nuclear waste is still under control, it is only a threat if we stop managing it, while CO2 is a threat today.

So the Greens are doing the worse they could to fight climate change, they are obsessed by irrelevant aspects.",NeutralPolitics,1

"Technically speaking, the United Nations has no enforcement agency (sorry, conspiracy theorists, no secret world army), though they can pass resolutions which allow nations to act as a strong-arm for the U.N. to deploy military intervention or sanctions. However, because China is a permanent U.N. Security Council member so can veto any resolutions against it should someone try to enforce the ruling.

There is precedence for the U.N. Parliamentary Assembly (basically that huge room you see pictures of where every nation gets one seat/vote) to override vetos if it can bring up a two-thirds majority (which was originally put in place when the U.S.S.R. was throwing a tantrum in the years after WW2 and automatically vetoing everything because the U.N. wouldn't recognise its ""totally independent, totally-not-puppet states"" as independent nations).

"This is how I think of it. We send manufacturing of all sorts of things overseas - to China, mostly.

The one thing we don't send overseas - military manufacturing.

The reason for that is obvious, we don't want foreign countries having easier access to our military technology than ourselves.

But in terms of manufacturing technology and the things that get manufactured, we've put all that power in the hands of countries that don't have our best interests in mind. I think manufacturing of goods designed by American companies should be built and assembled here so that in the case that (for example) if we want to stop China from expanding into the South China Sea they won't be able to just hold all our good hostage and leave us with no way to produce the bulk of things people want to buy on the day to day.",NeutralPolitics,1
"The best example I can think of are Gaddafi and Mubarak. In one country, the US (and western Europe, mostly them actually) had the political capacity to support rebels and oust a dictator in the Arab spring. In Egypt, we also supported the peaceful protests who overthrew Mubarak - in fact many would say it was precipitated by Obama's 2010 Cairo speech at the American University in which he spoke openly about standing up against dictators in democratic movements.  
  
So we supported the new democratic president, Muhammad Morsi. Until the Egyptians themselves overthrew him. You may recall but the US actually dissociated ourselves from the Al-sisi coup because we didn't like the idea of a general taking over a democracy in Egypt. So we actually withheld financial aid for a while.. until it was clear that he was staying in power. 
  
The US is opportunistic in that if we have a *change* to be idealistic and remove dictators, we'd love to. But we can't force it to happen, just look at Iraq as to why you can't force regime change.  
  
Is it also shameful for the US to talk to Chinese leadership? To talk to Iran or Cuba?  
  
I guarantee you if any of those countries were showing signs of democratic life, the US would be intending to support them. But until then, the US does have to deal with dictators sometimes. Doesn't make us evil. ",NeutralPolitics,1

"This is all very interesting. I'm not opposed to basic competency exams as long as they're basic and not biased (eg. basic logic, ability to detect logical fallacies). 

But before we even go down that path - we need to address the question of why voters are so ignorant and apathetic.

The ignorance is largely due to the fact that most working class people just don't have time to actively study politics on top of their grueling day jobs and taking care of their families. Having the time to research economic policy is a luxury that a single mom working two jobs and taking care of her family just can't afford. It's more plausible if you're a retiree and/or trust fund kid (why do you think city council meetings are full of them?).

The fact that working citizens aren't able to find enough free time to be informed citizens is enough justification to make a case for a shorter work week. 8 hours/day + 1 hour/day commuting doesn't leave you enough time to really have a life outside work, let alone follow and critically think about politics. The implementation of a basic income is one policy decision that would indirectly shorten the work week by giving citizens more freedom over their work situation. 

And voters are apathetic because the system is clearly broken and this country is extremely polarized. As a result, nothing gets done. Even congressmen have left office because they felt like they couldn't get anything done within the system. 

If ordinary citizens felt like they could actually make a difference, then they'd care more. 

As an ordinary citizen, why should I care? My 1 vote will never make a difference. I don't feel like I have any voice. I've written to my congressmen before, and I've never received a response.

But that's where I am, in a place that has public transit. Let's look at, for example, Sumter County (which is significantly smaller than L.A. County, but also doesn't have a public transit system as far as I can tell). Assume a person perhaps living on or near a farm as a hired hand with (as noted) no access to personal transportation coming from somewhere north of Geiger. Google Maps says that's a ~2 hour bike ride, or a ~8 hour walk to get to the county registrar's office. Luckily they probably won't have the lines I might experience, so we'll call it a flat hour to get the paperwork sorted and handled.

The other problem of voter ID laws is that they disproportionately effect low income votors. In part because poor people are more likely to not have a state ID. This could be because they never had a car thus never got a driver's license, or a number of other factors. This also disproportionately effects low invome voters because this adds another step in the process at the polls. In middle class neighborhoods and above where there are plenty of polling places this is no problem. But in poorer areas where there is a dearth of polling places there are already long lines to vote. More than 2 hours in many places. And adding just a few seconds to each interaction will add up quickly.

 This is important because it is a well studied effect that longer waits make voters less likely to vote. The waits also impact poor voters more because they tend to have jobs, transportation, and other schedules that are less flexible and thus are more impacted by long waits to vote.

What?  No.  We observe much higher rates of criminality among black people, because they are disproportionately targeted for arrest compared to their actual rates of commission of crime.

If laws were enforced equally on a racial basis, then we would see see a disparity that could be entirely explained by differential poverty rates.  We don't see that.

>the differences in poverty between the races accounts almost completely for the differences in crime.

You can feel that way all you like, but the statistics don't support that claim.

And the opportunities, educations, and stability of black families is grossly distorted by law enforcement targeting them wildly out of proportion to their actual rates of criminality, sending them to jail more frequently and for longer terms, and severely disrupting their family structure as a result.

The somali language and culture are focused around the horn of africa region, but include parts of kenya, eithiopia and eritria, maybe djibouti as well (former french somalia.)

Somali culture is organized by clans or tribes, which operate under a system of rules called Xeer (sounds like 'hair'). When two Somalis meet,  the first thing is they figure out how they are related to each other. This determines whether they will fuck or fight. I oversimplify. Clans have a council of elders. Typically their chief elder lady (or sometimes man) will have a son who acts as the military leader, a sort of sheriff type job. These are the guys who get called ""warlords"" in western media. The council of elders adjusts disputes between clans. Say a guy from your clan has killed somebody from their clan without good cause, he has to pay 50 camels to the guy's family.

Countries generally fall apart when the average national IQ drops below a threshold, I've seen as low as 90 and high as 97. ^3, ^4

> Seeing these correlations, it’s easy to assume that national IQ averages would correspond to specific degrees of development – that South Korea with an IQ of 107 would be much more civilized than Australia at 98, which in turn would be fairly similar to Russia or some other country at 97. But looking at the stats this is far from the case. Instead it seems like there is a point, somewhere around 97, above which a modern civilization can be maintained and below which things abruptly begin to fall apart. To illustrate this I’ll review some of the correlations mentioned above.

> According to the Corruptions Perceptions Index (CPI), the top 20 countries (again with a population of over one million) most free of corruption are ... Strictly speaking this is 21 nations since Austria and Ireland share the 20th spot and it seemed a bit random to exclude the one or the other. Anyway, we find 10 countries in the 98-99 range – including the top 4 and 6 in the top 10. The only three countries below 98 are Ireland (see above), Chile with an IQ of 90 and Uruguay with an IQ of 96. Again we see how everything is fine at 98, but at 97 and below things go south.

"[Scott Adams](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/153821538056/about-pizzagate) wrote a piece about the pizza thing that closely mirrors my thoughts on the matter.

You have to check your preconceptions at the door when looking at any evidence, whether those preconceptions lean in favor of accepting a certain claim or if they lean in favor of rejecting a certain claim.  The people investigating the claim have definitely made several verifiable connections that are strange, and some connections that aren't suspicious at all (all of them [here](https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1467064)).  The extent of the evidence is several strange connections that are all highly likely to be innocent in nature, but nevertheless still look strange when considered together.

The weirdest thing to me was the frequency of [certain symbols](https://file.wikileaks.org/file/FBI-pedophile-symbols.pdf) (the document [appears to be legitimate](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~sarhaus/MapsAndTimelines/Fall2007/Arlinghaus/WeeklyCrimeBulletins.html) and relates to a [real FBI initiative](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2006/february/innocent_images022406)), whether it be [businesses in the surrounding area](https://steemit.com/wikileaks/@ausbitbank/besta-pizza-is-owned-by-andrew-kline-of-the-human-trafficking-prosecution-unit-of-the-doj-pizza-parties-exposed) or [a director for the Clinton Foundation](http://pizzagate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elpida.jpg) (Elpida Home Project is an admirable initiative funding by the Radcliffe Foundation, founded by [Frank Giustra](https://www.clintonfoundation.org/about/board-directors#FrankGiustra)).

The idea of gerrymandering is to create the maximum number of safe seats for your party and the minimum for your opposition. Since so many seats are safe, incumbents face opposition from within their own parties rather than from the other party. This drives each party's candidates to more and more extreme positions trying to appeal to their base, rather than needing to moderate to attract voters across the spectrum.

I think any response to this question needs to be prefaced with the fact that people use the term ""judicial activism"" in a lot of contexts, and language by its nature is contextually defined, so to say there's one conclusive definition of ""judicial activism"" is, I think, misguided.

Nevertheless, I can tell you what it means in the legal community (which is distinct from the way news anchors or bloggers or lay people in general might use it). In the legal profession, it's also referred to as ""legislating from the bench"" ([here's](http://harvardpolitics.com/online/legislating-from-the-bench/) a decent article on it). The courts are supposed to be the faithful servant of Congress - meaning the judiciary doesn't write laws, it merely interprets and applies them (Congress enacts laws, and the executive enforces them).

So while it looks like the SCOTUS is creating law when they enter an opinion, what they're really doing is interpreting the law in question. Any seminal case you can think of is really just the court interpreting the Constitution. They're not, in theory, creating any new laws when they hold segregation to be unconstitutional, or bans on abortion, or certain gun controls. That may be the practical effect, but it's not really what's going on from a technical standpoint.

Where judicial activism comes into play is when the court steps out of its role as a faithful servant to Congress, and stops deferring to Congressional intent in lieu of the judge's own thoughts/biases/desires. There are all sorts of doctrines for interpreting laws and maintaining application of the laws in line with congressional intent (see /u/Weird_Carissa's comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/56a7r1/judicial_activism_what_is_the_proper_definition/d8i2u5d) for a good source). And judges only resort to those when there is no clear intent from Congress as to how to interpret/apply a law in a given instance. Courts frequently look to the legislative history of laws to tease out what Congress actually intended to mean by enacting a law.

And often times courts will notice that there's a gap in the law, but the law is nevertheless clear in how it should be applied in a certain case. See [this summary](https://www.justice.gov/enrd/tennessee-valley-authority-v-hill) of the case of *Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill* for a good example ([full case text here for a more in depth examination](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/437/153.html)). The court will basically say ""Look we know this is going to lead to an absurd result, but the law, as written, is quite clear that we have to decide this case a certain way. Since we're bound to the words and intent of Congress in applying these laws, the political forum is the more proper avenue for redress in this instance."" And the courts will essentially decline to rewrite laws that have clear gaps or issues in them, and they rely on Congress to amend or repeal the law as necessary. (Note: There are minor exceptions here, such as in instances of a [scrivener's error](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrivener#Doctrine_of_.22scrivener.27s_error.22).) That's what happened in TVA v. Hill - Congress came back later and amended the statute so as to avoid the absurd result which happened in TVA v. Hill. 

When judges opt to enter an opinion on a case in an instance where they could or should have deferred to the political process to provide redress (or when they fail to properly defer to the clear intent of congress), that's when they typically run the risk of being accused of judicial activism. So to lawyers, judicial activism really refers to a refusal to implement the proper or necessary canons of construction or a failure to properly defer to congressional intent.",NeutralPolitics,0

They sat on it just to the point where it's impossible to defend oneself from the accusations in time for the general election - and if you're going to take that tactic, would it really hurt to have several of the accusations be false?

"If we're purely speculating, then I've got some speculations for you. For one, it can be assumed Duterte personally (or publicly) does not care for US operations in the Philippines. 

As mayor in Davao, he blasted the US for scooping up Michael Meiring and getting him out of the country after an explosion went off in his hotel room. As early as 2011 he stated that he suspected the US had a hand in a handful of bombings-- an airport and a wharf for shipping. [Here's](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/10/11/497487363/why-philippine-president-rodrigo-duterte-distrusts-the-u-s) the first article I found to back up these claims, but the story is well reported. *To be clear, the story is well reported, but the actual claims behind what Duterte believes have yet to be substantiated as far as I know.*

Of course, that doesn't really explain the geopolitical nature of Duterte's decisions and there's undoubtedly more going on. I think Duterte is living up to his strongman image and appearing to stand up to the US is a popular action by such leaders. I don't think this is a viable long-term strategy as the US is [overwhelmingly seen in a favorable light](http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/global-opposition-to-u-s-surveillance-and-drones-but-limited-harm-to-americas-image/pg-2014-07-14-balance-of-power-1-02/) by Filipinos. As high as 92% in 2014 according to that Pew survey.

This has all happened so fast, so I'm not yet convinced this is a long-term realignment. The numbers just don't add up. I think this is a series opportunistic political moves. An example of common one is to distract a populace from domestic issues -- which the Philippines has many -- by focusing on a foreign policy crises. At home and abroad people will be talking about the Philippine realignment more so than the Duterte-sanctioned death squads. 

Secondly, the timing of all this lines up parallel to the US election. I first guessed that Duterte was simply threatening realignment so he can get some goodies from China while waiting to negotiate with a new US president. Then being seen as a strong negotiator looking out for his nation's interests when a deal is struck.  I could still be correct and in spring of 2017 we may see him ""calm down"" and renegotiate aid packages (compared to other allies the Filipinos get a small one,) military hardware procurement contracts (after decades of failed contracts they still need new planes,) and domestic operations involving US intelligence and LE/military agencies.

If this turns out to be true, then it's not necessarily a bad strategy. He gets some good deals from China in the short term and then some deals from the US later on. It's likely the US State Department knows this, but even if turns out to be false then I think the US plans to wait him out. The islands of the Philippines are the largest physical barrier in containing China. They're too important to let go.  He has a 6 year stint and then he's done. If not, well, the Philippines has a long and colorful history of military coups. ",NeutralPolitics,0

You can nit pick into a semantic argument if you like, I chose an article from someone who has a clear bias in favor of the ACA to help illustrate the point. The article is very clear on how this predicted outcome of the ACA is a reality.

I mean: http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-some-companies-are-cutting-hours-in-response-to-obamacare/

&gt;Yes, Some Companies Are Cutting Hours In Response To ‘Obamacare’

&gt;But set aside that debate and start with the basic factual question: Are Republicans right that employers are capping workers’ hours to avoid offering health insurance? The evidence suggests the answer is “yes,” although the number of workers affected is fairly small.

&gt;To figure this out, we can look at the Current Population Survey, the same monthly survey that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to calculate the numbers in the chart above. The BLS numbers, though, have two big problems if we’re interested in the impact of the Affordable Care Act. First, the BLS draws the line for “full-time” at 35 hours a week instead of 30. Second, the BLS is counting workers, not jobs — so someone working two 20-hour-a-week jobs would be counted as a full-time worker.

It's amazing you can say this article proves hours are not cut.

&gt;What do you think the tax increase is for?

Your outrage at my opinions, and lack of citations is the only clear part about your post.

When you say ""It Costs Nothing"" and ""What do you think the tax increase is for""... how does this prove it costs nothing? It costs in the tax increase, and it also costs the business that needs to hire a temp to cover you while you are on a 12 week paid leave.

"Okay, I get that you say there is a difference between judicial activism and judicial review, but I still don't see how they aren't EFFECTIVELY the same thing. Let's make an extreme case for the sake of argument. Let's say that some guy says that he has, I don't know, a 4th amendment right to consume any substance recreationally. Now he sues the government, the judge doesn't throw the case out, and he loses and appeals straight to the supreme court. The supreme court takes the case and they rule in his favor: The 4th amendment means that anyone can take an recreational substance. Now, how exactly do the other two branches of government go about over riding this decision? Maybe they could impeach all of the justices who voted for this thing, appoint new justices, and have them take up another case that undoes that decision. But if they could do that then they could do that based on any other case decision. They could pass a constitutional amendment, to undo that interpretation of the 4th amendment. But, once again, a constitutional amendment can make any new rights and/or restrictions that it wants, unconstrained by any other legal precedent, no matter what the court rules on any issue, the same high constraints for making a constitutional amendment, regardless of the nature of that issue, or a courts ruling on that issue. And, as far as I know, there is no way that congress or the president can officially invalidate a supreme court ruling on constitutional issues with mere federal legislation or an executive order.

All of this is going to say, yes, I get that ""ideally"" supreme court justices will not go far out of their way to skew the intent of a law. But a layman like me can see two ways in which Justices did: Citizens United, and The Obamacare One. So it seems to me that it can be assumed that if someone who was as biased towards left wing civil libertarianism as Scalia was towards right wing neo-liberalism that maybe, one day a supreme court justice will try and strike down all drug laws with an extra stretchy interpretation of the constitution.

"The problem, in my mind, is that pre-existing conditions is incompatible with how an insurance model actually works. Insurance, fundamentally, is a bet between you and a company that something bad *won't* happen. Insurance companies make this bet because they can pool risk and, in aggregate, make it worth their while. The consumer makes this bet for obvious reasons.

But if somebody already had something bad happen to them, then no sane insurer would sell insurance any lower than the price for treatment. Someone with a pre-existing condition doesn't need health *insurance*, they just need healthcare! And an insurance company has no reason to sell it to them because they are an intermediary between the healthcare provider and the healthcare receiver. What possible motive would they have?

Now, Obamacare actually recognizes this, that's why you are *forced*, under threat of fee / tax, to buy health insurance. Essentially, cost for people with pre-existing conditions is transferred to people who are healthy under this scheme. If you didn't have mandatory  health insurance this wouldn't work, because consumers would just forgo health insurance entirely until they needed it. Whether or not that transfer is a good thing is another question entirely, but I agree with /u/GodoftheCopyBooks that it's certainly problematic that the insurance model is forced to ignore pre-existing conditions. It messes up the incentives.

If you want to compare this to car insurance, a pre-existing condition would be like you drove uninsured, crashed your car, and *then* wanted to go and buy insurance. Obviously nobody would sell it to you.",NeutralPolitics,0

"For me, Hillary had the nomination locked in by april and the presidency by the time that trump won the nomination (though I can't deny that I got fairly nervous before the first debate). What i thought was the more interesting question was how, ""in play,"" the senate would be. 

About 2 weeks ago, it was a coin toss according to [538's model](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/senate/?ex_cid=2016-forecast). A week ago, it was 60/40 dem/repub. Yesterday, it climbed as high as 77% dems take the senate. Today, it's 70%. 

It's a bit horseracey, but each passing day means increasing accuracy. And I'm enamored by the idea of the the dems taking the senate. Partially because i'm a dem, but partially because it'll be a really interesting situation. 

I think we're all aware that the repubs have been stonewalling obama's scotus pick. And I think we're all further aware that scalia's seat isn't the only seat at stake. But I'm wondering if you're aware that there are also a lot of lower court nominations in the backlog. And the thing is that there is [no filibustering a lower court nominee since the dems used the nuclear rule in 2013 to make that so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_option#Events_of_November_2013).  So the dems can ram a bunch of bleeding heart liberal activist judges into the lower courts if they win the senate. But should they?

What is the better move? I read in [this article](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/obama-courts-judicial-legacy-226741) that one of the reasons that repubs legislators won't confirm even centrist judges at the moment is because the ones that obama nominates, even though they're centrist on paper, end up becoming liberal. So in essence, for clinton, it's not necessary agenda/liberal-legacy-wise to actually even nominate an overtly liberal judge. But it screams capitulation to many liberals who already dislike clinton's eagerness to reach across the aisle. 

If you were clinton and you had a senate majority, what type of judges do you nominate? A bunch of ginsbergs to appease/energize your base? A set of merrick garlands for possible leverage in future negotiations with repubs? Either choice is going to provide a lot of ammunition for groups that already hate clinton and will probably be important for midterms and in 2020.

What a peculiar situation! Also an explicit plug for the politico article linked above. it was great. it focused on obama's federal court appointments. It had a factoid that I, and the asian am community very much loved: obama has nominated more asian american federal judges than all past presidents combined. It's fun to ask why that is the case. Is it a consequence of the rise of asian americans? Or a consequence of affirmative action styled policies? Or a consequence of lessening racial barriers? Or some mix of all three? 

Lastly, here's an [extra infograph about the odds from the NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/senate-election-forecast.html), which lists other models' predictions. The upshot's model is currently at 60/40 dem/rep.",NeutralPolitics,0

One issue here is the question itself: How does one even define ""Is healthcare working""? ",NeutralPolitics,0

"Seems to me Trump explains that he goes for ""grabbing the pussy"" when he is successful in flirting with someone. He is also explaining failed attempts at seduction, as well as successful attempts.

I don't believe that it is the job of the moderator to offer a conclusion like this, especially with the opening question.

[It was a very much like Candy Crowly's interjection back in 2012.](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2012/10/17/candy-crowley-romney-was-right-in-the-main-on-benghazi-but-picked-the-wrong-word-in-debate/)

It also seems to me that Cooper is simply wrong. Trump isn't describing a rape scenario, where someone is telling him to stop but he kisses and gropes anyway. He is describing mutual attraction. When he does describe being turned down, he doesn't describe it as ""I groped her anyway"" or ""I kissed her anyway""... he describes it as:

&gt;“I moved on her, and I failed. I’ll admit it,” Trump is heard saying. It was unclear when the events he was describing took place. The tape was recorded several months after he married his third wife, Melania.

&gt;“Whoa,” another voice said.

&gt;“I did try and f--- her. She was married,” Trump says.

&gt;Trump continues: “And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, ‘I’ll show you where they have some nice furniture.’”

&gt;“I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there. And she was married,”

Trump is seeming to insult only himself in this scenario - and again doesn't describe anything that sounds to me like sexual harassment.

This is an interesting topic, but would you be willing to edit the post so it conforms to our [submission rules?](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_submission_rules)

Specifically, your post currently is not neutrally framed and does not uses sources which meet our quality guidelines.

There's also an issue with your title in that it asks a very narrow question about one comment, but then your submission includes a lot of information and associations with other comments and incidents throughout the Obama administration.  Are you trying to just ask about the narrow question of Obama's recent comments, or do you want to ask a different, broader question concerning government censorship of media in the United States?

If the latter, you'd need to resubmit with a different title because Reddit does not allow people to edit titles.  If the former, then I can go through what edits would be necessary to meet our guidelines.

"&gt; Is this a book a good entry into this guy's mind? 

Nope.

Chomsky is incredibly difficult to approach - his writing style perfectly fits his monotone voice: painfully dull at times - if most narrative history books flow like a rushing river of water in a mountain's valley, Chomsky flows like a drop of water being evaporated in a desert.

So, with that said, if you pick up Manufacturing Consent or The Chomsky Reader you'll get about 50 pages in before abandoning it. Further, a lot of his books are built upon a certain type of foundation knowledge long lost in the American liberal psyche. For example, a juxtaposition between Nicaragua and Turkish rebels in Iraq is going to presume you're aware of the Nicaraguan struggle, or that you'll research that topic independently. Chomsky will mention East Timor in passing with the assumption that you're well aware of the US backed Indonesian atrocities.

Meanwhile, Chomsky does have several books under 50 pages on specific topics. He also has a film ""Manufacturing Consent"" that somewhat goes along with the book. He's written several hundred articles. Start with Youtube, start with [his articles](https://chomsky.info/articles/) - if and only if you can stomach those, then approach a book.

All and all though, if you haven't found an innate draw to a Chomsky book already, you probably won't ever find him enjoyable or approachable in book form. I picked up Chomsky at the age of 13, but I'm a fucking weirdo, and now I think Chomsky's rather full of shit.",NeutralPolitics,0

**Marc Elias (Campaign General Council):**

&gt;If we do it case by case, then it will be subjective. We would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for. In judging whether to take the money, we would consider the relationship between that country and the United States, its relationship to the State Department during Hillary's time as Secretary, and its relationship, if any, to the Foundation. In judging the individual, we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and Hillary's past campaigns specifically. Put simply, we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists, except with a somewhat more stringent screen. As a legal matter, I am not saying we have to do this - we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely. I'm just offering this up as a middle ground.

&gt;In citing this figure, Trump can point to an official statistic. In 2012, China's State Administration of Cultural Heritage released a five-year-long study that the wall is 13,170 miles long -- much longer than the previous estimate of 5,500 miles, which was limited to the Ming-era structures.

&gt;But this number should be taken with a grain of salt, experts said.

&gt;For starters, this includes all of the wall, not just the Ming-era portions. And just a fraction of these 13,000 miles includes intact walls.

&gt;And contrary to the wall in Trump’s proposal, the wall ""is not contiguous,"" Swope said. This can be seen in the map portion of the graphic above.)

&gt;Waldron calls the Chinese government’s estimate the most generous measurement. ""China is endlessly puffing up the wall for the benefit of tourism,"" he said.

&gt;He said his fairest estimate would be perhaps 1,700 miles, ""with a solid line"" around Beijing and ""elsewhere a dotted line.""

&gt;In the view of the scholars we contacted, the wall also doesn’t serve as a particularly good model for Trump’s point.

&gt;Historically, trade was generally a far more successful policy than warfare. Indeed, walls didn’t stop the Mongols and the Manchus from crossing the frontier and causing serious trouble, including, ultimately, the fall of the Ming and the establishment of the Manchu, or Qing, dynasty that lasted from 1644 to 1912.

Oh, definitely.  I'm just saying that it's not something we should say, ""Oh, that explains it.  There really isn't a problem.""  Well, no, it just gives us a better idea that the providers and other companies are following the market and pricing things based on what people can afford to pay.

5) in a sense, the witnesses/accusers have been affected by the media publication of this video and can very likely be cognitively biased; fitting their experiences to the narrative. This retroactive memory is a common issue

"&gt; Are there any critiques of this work? It's a very attractive explanation--so simple.
&gt; 

To me it strikes me has half the picture, and ultimately asks the wrong question.

The conclusion is a slightly more complex version of, ""Costs are as high as they are because that price is what the market will bear.""  Well, no shit.  It sounds simple because it's virtually tautological.  It's a relatively free market, even if it is captive.  The market price is always the price the market will bear.  The question isn't, ""Are people paying for healthcare?"" it's, ""Are people *paying too much* for healthcare?"" and, ""How can we ensure that nobody faces bankruptcy because of medical debt, or neglects routine care due to medical costs?""  I'd speculate that we'd find the exact same relationship with respect to higher education, as well, and I don't think many people would argue that the cost of a college education isn't [wildly](http://www.deltacostproject.org/sites/default/files/products/Delta-Cost-Not-Your-Moms-Crisis_0.pdf), [absurdly](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/cost-of-college-degree-increase-12-fold-1120-percent-bloomberg_n_1783700.html) out of control yet people keep buying it.

Another problem I see with the analysis is that the healthcare system in [the US doesn't supply heathcare for all it's citizens](http://kff.org/uninsured/fact-sheet/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/) but all the other OECD nations provide *universal* healthcare to all citizens (to the best of my understanding).  IMO, that significantly spoils the per capita nature of the analysis.  We have people participating in the economic marketplace and generating GDP, but are unable to purchase *any* health insurance.  Given the tremendous difference in billing of insured vs uninsured medical procedures this is like betting that you won't get sick or injured because a single incident can easily cost more than several years of insurance, particularly because [hospitals gouge the uninsured](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/why-some-hospitals-can-get-away-with-price-gouging-patients-study-finds/2015/06/08/b7f5118c-0aeb-11e5-9e39-0db921c47b93_story.html) (supposedly because insurance companies make them agree to that, but I can't find a good article that really says that).

Edit: There's another assumption in the article: that healthcare is a superior good -- a term that's often synonymous with *luxury* goods.  Do we agree with that assessment?  *Should* healthcare be a more available as income increases?  Does that truly make sense?  Is it more valuable to society to allow people who would otherwise be contributing members of society to get sick or die due to being unable to afford care?  Is that a reasonable position?

"&gt; So AIC doesn't factor in quality of law and order, quality of roads, sewage systems and many other things which do cost money and which do make countries ""wealthier"" but are collective and not based individual consumption. 

I didn't argue that AIC tells you everything you should want to know about a society, but I am concerned with predicting HCE here and these sorts of expenditures are weak predictors of HCE (AIC largely mediates these relationships).  That it also outperforms HCE as a predictor of life expectancy, life years lost, and the like is interesting, to say the least.

&gt; Also it's very hard to quantify quality of education/healthcare.

What is your point?   We can only measure what we can measure and it's not as if these subjective aspects are captured in any other economic aggregate of this nature.

&gt; There's no denying that the public schools in the US are far worse than for example in the Netherlands.

That's actually [highly debatable](https://randomcriticalanalysis.wordpress.com/2016/05/09/my-response-to-the-nytimes-article-on-school-districts-test-scores-and-income/).  [Non-hispanic whites in the US do about as well on average as the Netherlands as a whole does](http://isteve.blogspot.com/2013/12/overall-pisa-rankings-include-america.html) and in many states (e.g., MA, CT, etc) whites significantly outperform the Netherlands (and several other much vaunted european countries).  Moreover, [large between group differences exist in these welfare states too](https://randomcriticalanalysis.wordpress.com/2016/05/09/my-response-to-the-nytimes-article-on-school-districts-test-scores-and-income/#groups_internationally) and [there exist formal studies showing that country of origin](http://www.centreformacroeconomics.ac.uk/Discussion-Papers/2016/CFMDP2016-14-Paper.pdf) is a strong predictor of outcomes even generations later. 

In short, academic performance is significantly endogenous -- genetics and cultural factors determine most of the variance, ergo it's a mistake to assume differences on the broad averages mean one system is ""far worse"" than another. 

&gt;  It just is much more subjective than GNI for example.

They're generally well correlated (r=.93 in 2011) and AIC is every bit as objective as GNI.  However, AIC is still more relevant here.  AIC is a better predictor of [life expectancy](https://s16.postimg.org/53nth8vo5/life_expectancy_compare_gni_and_aic.png) and of [health care expenditures](https://s14.postimg.org/fopmusntt/nhe_compare_gni_and_aic.png).  The [plot looks a lot like GDP](https://s21.postimg.org/lonwirgc5/nhe_by_gni.png) vis-a-vis fitting high export countries.  AIC also explains a large fraction of these residuals for GNI in multiple specifications (linear, polynomial, etc).... so yeah, having actually double-checked, I'd say AIC &gt; GNI for these purposes.

&gt; That's why GNI is often preferred ove GDP and why GNI is used by the HDI.

HDI is completely apples-and-oranges.  Whereas AIC and GNI are actually pure economic aggregates HDI bakes in life expectancy, education, literacy, and more in a somewhat convoluted formula. ",NeutralPolitics,0

I know that 20-25mg puts me in a sweet spot, so thats what I do. When you buy any of these edibles, the dispensary worker will ask you if you have experience and if not will tell you to start slow with a 5-10mg dose and see how it effects you and how long you should wait until trying more.

Similarly, Trump is up by [9.0%](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/in/indiana_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson-6108.html) per their polling average.

Lets just assume that the numbers are 100% accurate. if 75% of the voting populous do not split their ticket, that means 25% do.  So that 25% must account for the 14.5% differential.  The way to make that work is that ~80% of the ""split-ticketers"" (~20% of the total vote) would have to split in favor of Bayh.  

Bayh was one of the more conservative democrats in the senate when he served and thus can also be  seen as a pseudo-incumbant [(having served in the senate for two terms).  He also serve in two other statewide offices (Governor for two terms and secretary of state for 1 term prior to that)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bayh).

____________

Moving on to the quoted bullet points: 

&gt; According to California's nonpartisan fiscal advisor Prop 60 could cost taxpayers ""TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS"" each year; money that could be spent on education, health care, libraries, police and fire services.

The cost is a good point, and people voting should weigh up whether the benefits outweigh the costs. I'm not quite sure how they reach that figure of 10,000,000+. I'd have to see their estimates, but this is the strongest argument of the lot and there's good reason it's put up front. Since I don't really see much benefit to passing the law in the first place, any significant cost would be enough to nix it.

&gt; The ultimate trial lawyer ballot measure, Prop 60 gives EVERY Californian the right to sue adult film performers, including LGBT performers, on-set workers, and even cable and satellite television companies. The initiative's presumption of liability could apply to every adult film on cable television today.

Every Californian *already* has the right to sue anyone they want. The question is whether they'd succeed. If studios don't follow the rules the suits will have merit. If they do, then they don't. I'm not really sure why this is an issue? This is how laws work. Also, why call out LGBT performers? Would the law be better if gay performers were exempt?

&gt; Prop 60 could force adult film performers to publicly disclose private information, including their legal names and HOME ADDRESSES.

To whom? To the official body in charge of licensing? Why is that any more of an issue than having to give your address at the DMV? 

&gt; State employees will have to ""review"" adult films.

Not seeing the issue here. 

EDIT: Ah, hinting at a first-amendment issue, where government bodies should not have the right to say yay or nay to the content of movies? I can see that being problematic. I presume that the review criteria are structured in such a way as to not fall afoul of this. If they're not, then that either has to be fixed or the law's going to be struck down as unconstitutional anyway. Hmm, I wonder if there's precedent for condom use/non-condom use in performance as a matter of free expression. I suppose the ""safety"" argument would be the counter - you don't have the right to break OSHA regulations just because you're filming it, after all.

&gt; The named proponent is authorized to be ""sworn in"" as a state employee and he cannot be fired; only the Legislature can VOTE him out of the job.

Still not seeing the issue here. They can be removed by consensus in the legislature - how is that different from many other such positions?

&gt; Married couples who film in their own homes can be sued.

If said married couple is *selling their pornographic videos* then yeah, makes sense they can be sued. They're a porn studio. This bullet point is meant to imply that private videos can be cause for a lawsuit, which isn't true.",NeutralPolitics,0

[CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/28/pf/child-care-costs/) now reports that the cost of child care exceeds the cost of in-state college tuition in some cases. 

Given that child care costs are probably high everywhere, has anyone done any analysis on the net effect of the 2K tax relief on lower-middle income families? This feels like a cat-toy tax break to me. Interesting and distracting but doesn't do much

Why/how is a family of 4 making 45 - 70K a year in the 'burbs of a city like Seattle or San Francisco going to peel 2K off their meager paychecks for child-care accounts (or however that breaks out)? I can see where practically speaking that the vast majority of people who could be targets for this tax break will never use it because they live hand-to-mouth and deferring 2K, which won't cover more than 1 - 3 months child care, is not realistic or reasonable.

By law, the SSA must continue to pay the full benefits, and beneficiaries have a legal claim to those benefits.  On the other hand, by law, the SSA cannot pay benefits in excess of the funds it has, and ~~has~~ (edit: will have) no assets which can be tapped to pay the benefits it owes but cannot pay.  Nor is their any process for declaring the SSA bankrupt or insolvent.  So as a practical matter, the SSA will not pay the benefits, and the lawsuits will do nothing.

Congress has no legal obligation to do anything, although as a practical matter they should (and very well might) change one of the conflicting laws to resolve the issue, but there's a lot of possible changes, and funding the shortfall is just one of them.  (They could also just cut benefits.  Which would be completely legal, although rather problematic for anyone wanting to win re-election.)

"&gt; There isn't any universal law like you describe-

I disagree. It's a basic animalistic defense mechanism to kill off the rabid beast whose actions are unpredictable and threatening you. I wasn't talking about the law of man as much as I was trying to describe a law of nature.

In many countries on earth there is no legal system beyond the closest person with a gun, and lives are taken violently and quickly all the time. Ghana or Yemen come to mind, as well as many parts of Libya and Syria today... 

I certainly agree - many countries have abolished this law. I'm not really arguing if the death penalty is a good or bad idea - Just where it came from.

&gt; I don't think there's much, if any evidence to suggest it is something innate to people.

Not for people who live in a society that is stable (IE: Western society). But it is clearly the norm in the failed state, and ultimately that comes from the lack of ability to rehabilitate or deter the behavior there. The ability to move on - evolve if you will - to a state that does not give out the death penalty requires a civilization that can afford to imprison long term, and a police state that can provide stability. Once that stability is removed, it reverts naturally back to kill or be killed.

Again, I think ""We have evolved beyond it"" is a rational argument. But it doesn't disprove what I am saying.",NeutralPolitics,0

"You need to be far more specific about what kind of war games they are running.

Hop on over to r/geopolitics for more specifics, and some really credible conversation on what follows. I am not an expert, and am extrapolating from what I've read there, and from every foreign policy and national defense podcast that exists. There are none that refute what I'm about to say, although they actually provide the sources to back it up.

Russia's military strategy is built around defense and local incursions.  It boasts a decidedly immobile army beyond its relatively close sphere of influence. It can be effective in Syria because of its alliance with the Assad regime, but beyond its relatively few military allies, Russia's reach drops off dramatically.  

What this means is that Russia can stage incursions close to its own borders, and can wage an uncostested aerial attack out of an extremely limited number of allied nations. Its air might doesn't extend to contested zones and won't win air superiority against the US anywhere outside of Russia. 

Russia's strategy has always been one of defense, and doesn't have the cabability to extend itself like the US can. This is because the American military strategy is based on totally different principles.

The US by contrast, is a mobile offensive force that is totally unmatched in what it seeks to do.  The US built a very highly mobile military that allows American interests to be projected literally anywhere in the world at extremely short notice. This 30 year strategy has created a totally intergrated global force that doesn't have anything close to an equal on a global scale. The US can coordinate its combined arms with little to no preparation. 

So what does this mean for war games? If the US invaded Russia, all analysis points to failure. We would simply not be able to sustain any kind of victory in Russia if ever that got in anyone's mind. At the same time, Russia is wholy incapable of invading the US. Beyond defense of its own borders, Russia would lose virtually any other scenario. Russia lacks the mobility to contest multiple fronts simultaneously anywhere beyond its own borders. 

So...yes. We lose an invasion of Russia, but there is no conceivable scenario in which we would actually do that. When you talk about war games, refer to the actual simulations being run. Those scenarios are very relevant to the conversation.
