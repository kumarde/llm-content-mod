"It is absolutely a mental disorder. I mean, what else could it be? Surely it's not a biological disorder. It's probably closely related to that disorder where people feel like a part of their body is foreign, like a leg or something, and they want it removed even though it's perfectly healthy. There's something in their brain that causes a disconnection from the reality of their bodies. When it comes to amputating healthy limbs, no doctor with any sense of morality would dream of it. I don't see this any different. Though I do think the best choice is probably to let them have a gender reassignment surgery seeing as suicide rates are astronomically high for transgender people.

"I agree with you that the point of our education system isn't to teach you things like how to do your taxes.  I somewhat agree with you that those things *shouldn't* be the point of our educational system.  Chemistry and Shakespeare and things like that have value, so schools should teach them.  I certainly think that the main point of the educational system should be to teach students how to learn and think critically and to give as many of them as possible the opportunity to study further in whatever field they may be interested in.

However, I understand the view of the people who say that should be the point (or a point) of our education system.  You *need* to know how to pay taxes and balance your checkbook and stuff like that.  It certainly makes sense that there be *someone* whose job it is to teach you those things, and if not the school system, then who?  You can have a different or better answer than that, but I certainly view it as a ""reasonable"" position to hold.

Personally, I think that if schools did teach things like doing your taxes and balancing your checkbook, it would be pretty ineffective, because most 15 year olds don't care to learn about that stuff, and the ones that do are the ones who would most likely be able to figure it out on their own.",changemyview,1

"I'm pretty on board with you about marriage generally being a negative thing for society because it's part of a system that allows governments, politicians, and lobbying influences to have a high degree of control of personal lives and social norms. It screws over women pretty badly too, because women face a higher pressure to marry and have children at the expense of their personal ambitions.  Basically, we've probably lost a huge number of extremely capable women to the married SAHM lifestyle, and that's a shame.  Marriage has also turned into a political bargaining chip for the religious right, and that's worrying too.  And most of the modern idea of marriage is invented by marketers anyway.

So if you want rational reasons to never get married, go with those.

However, despite the high divorce rate, many of these concerns can be alleviated by making a prenuptial agreement before you get married.  Alimony and spousal support aren't as common anymore as you might think, actually, and having a prenup that clearly outlines how resources and belongings will be distributed in the event of divorce can make things a lot less expensive and easy for you.

If you like the idea of committing yourself to a woman and having a real bond based on love and trust, why do you need a county clerk to sign a piece of paper for you to do that?

Except ""poor"" Blacks and Muslims ""naturally"" feel the need to murder whites as they were oppressed by them - we whites should just ""tolerate"" their ""rightful anger"" expressing itself dangerously. I try to find something that would change OPs view. And I found one minor disagreement: OP mentions ""minor privileges"" that whites have. That is an understatement. Also OP claims that poor whites did nothing against Blacks in the past when ""the system"" was more like apartheid. It is true. But on the other hand even poor whites were on the side of slave-liberation (and other liberation moveemnts) so it simply is not true. Not only did they not do anything against Blacks they fought (and gave their lives) for the (now existing) equality of Blacks. The problem is more in the grey area of ""empathy evolution""- namely that different ethnic groups have different empathy deficit level. (Inside the groups too there is a split:more empathic and tolerant Leftists have less violence - only abandonment - in their childhood according to Lloyd deMAuse on www.pschohistory.com).

It doesn't help either that all the fight scenes are edited by a teenager with Tourette's and Parkinson's, it's as if they want to distract the audience from how shoddy everything looks by waving a flashlight on their face. I couldn't give a damn about any of these sterile excuses for characters. During the airport scene all the artificially-inflated conflict devolved into a child playing with one toy in each hand and bashing them together.

It's riddled with sophomoric and shallow pseudo-political ponderings that are thrown out the window when the quiptastic action starts. They completely disregard for the umpteenth time the collateral damage while they're having fun showcasing their flashy abilities.

The third act pretends to get serious when in reality it turns into a cheap heartstring manipulation revolving around ""why didn't you tell me Cap? Wahh!""

This part completely disregards the fact that Stark knows all too well that brainwashing and mental manipulation is a thing, let's not forget that he has witnessed it firsthand with Banner. There's no excuse for him to have such a sudden change of heart other than to extend the conflict for another 15 minutes of mindless violence, and leave the manchildren with the impression that they've just witnessed an intricate revenge tragedy.

All smoke and mirrors, the constant quipping is an effective tool to cloud a fanboy's mind and judgement.

Finally, what's left is an entire team of ""world-class"" heroes that got fooled by a man wearing a Bucky mask--not to mention that the villain's stale trope was better executed 19 years ago when Scream 2 came out, ironically, a film satirizing this cliché.

Apparently it is as OP has engaged in several conversations on that subject, as well as a few other posters bringing up the same point. News flash: threads are just collections of conversations buddy. the thread is about what the thread is about. 

If you'd like to exercise absolute and complete control over what topics can and cannot be discussed in any given thread you are free to start your own sub and rule it with the iron fist you so desperately long for.

>There is no part of this that supports the idea that supporting Trump implies supporting every aspect of his personality

Awesome! I'll make a note of that and keep it in my drawer full of very important notes that I refer to often.

>Even if we accept your obviously false assertion that ""The persona he chooses to put forth is literally all there is as a candidate to support"" (as if Trump has absolutely no political policies - nevermind whether you think they are good policies), it does not follow that a Trump supporter must support every aspect of his personality, because supporting a candidate for their persona does not imply supporting the entirety of that persona.

Sweet. I'll put this next to that other note. (also: I thought we weren't talking about his policies? I'm confused.)

The real answer: You are a man, I assume. Think about everything that society does to make your life as a man more difficult. Write it all down, be brutally honest with yourself. Next, find a woman that trusts you implicitly, enough so that you know she won't shirk away from the answer, because this question is so incredibly personal that once you ask it, it will seriously change your life, and your relationship with every woman you ever meet.

I see the TPP as another push from globalists like the [Bilderberg Group](https://stopsyjonizmowi.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/bilderberg.jpg). I have no doubt that most of the TPP was influenced (if not written) by this group. We won't see the real affects of this until it is put in place and enforced.

All the people in the inner circle in the chart above meet in a [private conference](http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/) every year. Their aim, in the words of the founder and steering committee member for 30 years, Dennis Healey is as follows:

> To say we were striving for a one-world government is exaggerated, but not wholly unfair. Those of us in Bilderberg felt we couldn't go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless. So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing

[Source](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/10/extract1)

The Clinton's are members of the Bilderberg Group which is why I won't vote for Hillary. She will more than likely try to push this through in private while publicly denouncing it to placate the public. The same goes for the other politicians that are a part of this group and there are many.

According to Prof. [Andrew Kakabadse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Kakabadse), author of the book ""Bilderberg People"", the theme of these meetings is to

"The California Bar association (for example) is a public corporation -- implying it's a politically influenced government agency is downright disingenuous, but this whole point is just pedantic. Bar associations began, and are still run largely, by the professionals who comprise it and the judiciary. They are as independent as an organization as important as it is can get. If you're proposing an independent journalism review board, say that.

The main problem with your proposal is that you think that decidable, objective facts exist in larger number than they do. It's an epistemological issue -- what constitutes a fact is not an objective matter for most of the questions which people would take issue with. If a newspaper says a plane crashed and it didn't, that can be fact-checked. If someone takes issue with describing Donald Trump's language as incendiary, how is that even decidable? Did he say ""light this place on fire,"" because if not, then it's arguable that he literally wasn't being incendiary -- why should someone else get to tell me that the statement wasn't meant literally?

The idea that jurors would be, essentially, asked to review newspapers and websites for factual inaccuracies is frightening. It's hard to believe that anyone who knows how juries work thinks that this system could scale all the way to the point where any written work, claiming to be fact, could be reviewed, redacted or whatever. Juries have never made egregious mistakes, and afterwards freely admit to resisting juror instructions and basing those decisions on bias.

"Firstly, at the risk of sound fallacious, Wikipedia is garbage. 

Secondly, to dissect the definition:

These two are oxymorons.

Capitalism is laissez-faire, and any variation thereof isn't capitalism. I'm assuming you can see that the rest of your definition, like wikipedia, is useless.

>I'm a Hamiltonian Nationalist.

This oughta be bloody hilarious.

>Progressivism Tempered by Conservatism–

LOL

Like I said before, *you're part of the problem.* 

>While the ultimate progressive aims of Hamiltonian government seek to serve the people as a whole and preserve and expand the scope of individual rights under liberty, and improve the life of every American so far as government has the power to remove constraints to equality of opportunity, the progressive Hamiltonian is fundamentally conservative in their view of unchanging human nature, human imperfection, the organic nature of the state and society, **the fallacy of pure reason, and the criticality of tradition and custom.**

That actually sounded good up until that last tidbit. Tradition is what gives us the American Nation. Any breaking from it inevitably leads to degeneracy and decay. 

>New Nationalist Subsidiarity- The philosophy of Hamiltonianism is that the most crucial political unit to be tended is the American nation, but that that tending is best done at the level of every problem and issue. Not everything can be managed centrally, but everything can be managed in the name of the American interest. **Therefore, Hamiltonianism supports greater centralization in certain cases, like national defense and banking regulation, while supporting greater devolution of power in other areas, like education and infrastructural policy.**

Central banks are a horrendous idea, as we see now with the federal reserve printing out money to keep Obama's horrendous policies from collapsing the country.

> Hamiltonians support the fundamental tenets of the welfare state while being suspicious of government’s ability to carry out the dreams of expanded welfare progressivism.

The welfare state, at it's core, is incompatible with capitalism. I don't know why people don't understand this. 

>The Hamiltonian is populist in that he acts in the broad interest of the American people, giving ear to the people’s voice and the wisdom of the ages; **yet he is elitist in that he believes that a moral elite that is in at least some ways technocratic must conduct governance.**

So, summarized, we need to make sure that benevolent, elitist nerds rule the country. This definitely can't go wrong in any way.

>And I never said there aren't any Marxists in academia, I said the vast majority are not Marxists. 

Still tickles my funny bone either way.

If you tell the cops one thing and then later go on to say something else, guess what? They call that something don't they? This is something we totally need. 

lol. And your guys want a new punishment for those darned rape victims.

>You have to remember that criminal trials aren't happening willy nilly.

*You* have to remember that there's a veritable wealth of proof that rape victims get treated like shit by every single level of the process *and* by people in the community. Threatening to give more penalties for people who break before the process is over is just another tool society can and *will* use to keep rape victims from even trying to get justice.

We're already doing a bang up job of scaring victims into silence. I refuse to sit here and watch you folks pretend we need more tools to do a better job. Tell me that there's rape victims out there who upon reading about a lady getting tossed in the pen for a month or who then goes on to be more likely to tell the police a fucking thing.

Really. Go ahead and argue some more of that.

>Prosecutors aren't just flipping around after every case and saying ""ok, I couldn't prove they were guilty, so now I'm gonna prove you are"".

Sure. We've never heard of any prosecutor treating rape victims abominably, like throwing them in the pen for a month because they had melt down or anything. I'm sure that if I had any proof of something like that happening I would have posted it in my very last response to this thread.

No one would ever use the threat of legal action to keep rape victims from coming forward. Cops have never harassed a victim with threats of legal repercussions for lying.

And here you are along with OP, mad that this doesn't happen often enough I guess. The family wasn't destroyed by the rapist alone, the cops helped quite a bit.

>The cases you mentioned are unfortunate and poorly handled, but unrelated to the idea of false accusations.

lol. So we know rape victims get treated horribly by every part of the legal system and by their communities at large every fucking day, but that doesn't matter. That's just a meaningless distraction when we're spitballing more punishments for people who report rape. Are you serious with this shit?

Seriously. Those were just the most recent examples and most easily found. I can spend all frigging day showing examples of rape victims getting fucked over by cops, by judges, by the communities they live in, and even the families they have. They also get their lives torn apart by dipshits on places like reddit who think rape doesn't happen or that people are asking for it by leaving their house. 

Thanks to the internet this shit is pretty god damned easy to find. There's got to be tens of thousands of examples in your language. How about you spend a little time reading about shit that really happens before trying to change the system to make it *worse* for victims? FFS",changemyview,1

That way the only way candidates will be able to have a larger budget, is if they have a larger number of donations from more citizens, instead of donations from wealthier citizens or corporations, and corporations will no longer sufficiently influence politicians to their own ends, since their donations hold no more value than your average citizen's.

"Terrorism is simply the most visible symptom of the root issue.

Dr. Hammond's doctorate is in Theology. He was born in Capetown in 1960, grew up in Rhodesia and converted to Christianity in 1977. Adapted from Dr. Peter Hammond's book: Slavery, Terrorism and Islam: The Historical Roots and Contemporary Threat:

Islam is not a religion, nor is it a cult. In its fullest form, it is a complete, total, 100% system of life.

Islam has religious, legal, political, economic, social, and military components. The religious component is a beard for all of the other components.

Islamization begins when there are sufficient Muslims in a country to agitate for their religious privileges.

When politically correct, tolerant, and culturally diverse societies agree to Muslim demands for their religious privileges, some of the other components tend to creep in as well..

Here's how it works:

As long as the Muslim population remains around or under 3% in any given country, they will be for the most part be regarded as a peace-loving minority, and not as a threat to other citizens. This is the case in: United States -- Muslim 2% Australia -- Muslim 2.5% Canada -- Muslim 2.8% Norway -- Muslim 2.8% China -- Muslim 2.9% Italy -- Muslim 2.5%

At 3% to 8%, they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, often with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs. This is happening in:

Denmark -- Muslim 5% Germany -- Muslim 6.7% United Kingdom -- Muslim 7.7% Spain -- Muslim 8% Thailand -- Muslim 7.6%

From 8% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population. For example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature halal on their shelves -- along with threats for failure to comply.

This is occurring in:

France -- Muslim 12% Philippines -- 9% Sweden -- Muslim 8% Switzerland -- Muslim 8.3% The Netherlands -- Muslim 8.5% Trinidad &amp;amp; Tobago -- Muslim 10.8%

At this point, they will work to get the ruling government to allow them to rule themselves (within their ghettos) under Sharia, the Islamic Law. The ultimate goal of Islamists is to establish Sharia law over the entire world.

When Muslims approach 15% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions. In Paris, we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non Muslim action offends Islam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam, with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam. Such tensions are seen daily, particularly in Muslim sections, in:

Guyana -- Muslim 15% India -- Muslim 19.4% Israel -- Muslim 16% Kenya -- Muslim 18% Russia -- Muslim 21%

After reaching 25%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues, such as in:

Ethiopia -- Muslim 32.8%

At 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare, such as in:

Bosnia -- Muslim 40% Chad -- Muslim 53.1% Lebanon -- Muslim 59.7%

From 60%, nations experience unfettered persecution of non-believers of all other religions (including non-conforming Muslims), sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon, and Jizya, the tax placed on infidels, such as in:

Albania -- Muslim 70% Malaysia -- Muslim 60.4% Qatar -- Muslim 77.5% Sudan -- Muslim 70%

After 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out the infidels, and move toward 100% Muslim, such as has been experienced and in some ways is on-going in:

Bangladesh -- Muslim 83% Egypt -- Muslim 90% Gaza -- Muslim 98.7% Indonesia -- Muslim 86.1% Iran -- Muslim 98% Iraq -- Muslim 97% Jordan -- Muslim 92% Morocco -- Muslim 98.7% Pakistan -- Muslim 97% Syria -- Muslim 90% Tajikistan -- Muslim 90% Turkey -- Muslim 99.8% United Arab Emirates -- Muslim 96%

100% will usher in the peace of 'Dar-es-Salaam' -- the Islamic House of Peace.. Here there's supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrasses are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word, such as in:

Afghanistan -- Muslim 100% Saudi Arabia -- Muslim 100% Somalia -- Muslim 100% Yemen -- Muslim 100%

Unfortunately, peace is never achieved, as in these 100% states the most radical Muslims intimidate and spew hatred, and satisfy their blood lust by killing less radical Muslims, for a variety of reasons.

'Before I was nine I had learned the basic canon of Arab life. It was me against my brother; me and my brother against our father; my family against my cousins and the clan; the clan against the tribe; the tribe against the world, and all of us against the infidel. -- Leon Uris, 'The Haj'

It is important to understand that in some countries, with well under 100% Muslim populations, such as France, the minority Muslim populations live in ghettos, within which they are 100% Muslim, and within which they live by Sharia Law. The national police do not even enter these ghettos. There are no national courts, nor schools, nor non-Muslim religious facilities.. In such situations, Muslims do not integrate into the community at large. The children attend madrasses. They learn only the Koran. To even associate with an infidel is a crime punishable with death. Therefore, in some areas of certain nations, Muslim Imams and extremists exercise more power than the national average would indicate.

Today's 2 billion Muslims make up 28% of the world's population. But their birth rates dwarf the birth rates of Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, and all other believers. Muslims will exceed 50% of the world's population by the end of this century.

"Alright. Honestly, I could attack this from plenty of angles.

The crux of your argument is that money provides you with property and status and that this therefore makes you happier. This is a very narrow and materialistic view of life. While a lack of money will make you unhappy an excess of money isn't necessarily going to do the opposite. [Look at Maslows Hierarchy of needs](http://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) While the very lowest layers of human needs require money, everything else is free. Happiness comes from within. Once one is able to live comfortably all one needs to be happy is a healthy mind and a healthy body.

I believe that in life, and I believe that fully - but here's why I could never be rich. Even if I did come into wealth by some means I would not be comfortable with it. We live in a world where poverty kills, and I do believe that the 1% have a moral responsibility to help. ",changemyview,0

"&gt; But if almost 90% of major attacks in 2016 came from 1% of the population (Muslims), how can you tell me there is no correlation?

If they're not categorized properly, then they aren't 90% of the attacks. 

And my argument would be that it's because terrorist groups follow a similar pattern to other groups. These other groups draw others away from terrorism.

First, it's almost NEVER the majority group of a country, unless they're a majority that's specifically oppressed, like the native Irish or Black South Africans. This eliminates whites for the most part, they just don't fit the profile. The exception being the groups who think they ARE oppressed—but those aren't at issue. I would argue that most terrorists in the western world follow a similar pattern, you can see it especially with people who join ISIS. They're disaffected young men (some women), who are looking for a purpose and sense of belonging in life and don't feel accepted by mainstream culture. They aren't first generation immigrants, but they don't feel part of the culture they were raised in either. Terrorists recruit these people by making them feel like they would belong, giving them that purpose and using that to radicalize. This is how ISIS recruited middle class Muslim youth, often teenagers or little older, to join them. 

You'll see something there that's quite telling. 

Replace ""terrorists"" with ""gangs"", you get a similar profile. 

Basically, terrorist groups use the same tactics that gangs use to recruit members. They take in people who need to belong, give them things they want (money, drugs, power, purpose, whatever), become an integral part of their support system. Usually it's a slow integration. Not straight to shooting rivals or straight to ""death to the infidel"". Instead they start out with small things the person can agree with. The more they agree, the more they belong, the more they belong and the more they interact, the more they'll believe. They strip away all the other structures until only the CAUSE matters. You see this same method all over. Cults use it. Hate groups use it. Gangs use it. Even PYRAMID SCHEMES use it. It's a method that takes extremely vulnerable people and brings out what is dangerous in them. And it works far more on those who feel disaffected—minorities, the poor, people who aren't poor but are at a formative period (like young adulthood.)

Why is it Muslims in the terror attacks? Because other groups are drawn in by different predators. Whites are less affected because they're a majority, the ones who are affected end up in groups like the KKK or Scientology or any number of other, similar movements. Blacks and Hispanics? They're far more likely to be exposed and taken under the wings of a gang than of a terrorist group, it's more widespread in their communities. 

Muslims aren't as exposed to these options. This leaves a group that's more vulnerable. It's not happening much in America compared to elsewhere. Way more people from the UK, France or Germany have joined ISIS than Americans, even though America is larger than all of them combined. Muslims are a smaller minority, there's less of a separate community where the kinship would be built. In Germany they're 3% and even more when young people are considered. France is at 10%, the UK is around 5%. 

The point is simple. Muslim's are simply more likely to be drawn into terrorism, because other minorities are drawn into groups that use similar methods, but don't commit terrorist attacks. It's a problem of disaffected, vulnerable people tricked by sociopaths, not an issue of religion. If it was the religion, then it would be Muslims as a whole, not so heavily focused on the youth.

Pretty much nobody admits to being racist.  Yet, lots of racist people clearly exist, and they say things like ""I simply do not find dark black women to be attractive.""  And maybe some of those people are being honest, and maybe some of them are actually racist and don't want to date black women for a variety of reasons that aren't socially acceptable to say in public.  There are plenty of guys who say that they prefer blondes, but I have yet to meet someone who said he would refuse to date a woman who wasn't blonde or who said they were incapable of finding brunettes or redheads attractive.  If your preference for a certain skin tone is so strong that you'll refuse to date anyone outside of what you prefer, a lot of people might think that there's something else going on.

Know what different customs you'll need to adapt to, what different training you might need to add if you want to move up to more serious jobs there, and what the immigration process is like if you're thinking of staying.  It's likely a bad idea if all you want is ""to live abroad"". But if you have a particular goal, plan carefully, and good luck getting it wherever you want to go.  

The focus there again is on ""what is your goal?"".  That's the same above here. And that's the part you refuse to get. If your goal is ""to have the most money as fast as possible"", then it's a bad idea, and I agree with you. But *that is not everyone's goal*, not should it be. And for someone with a different goal from you, it's not a remotely stupid idea.  
Similarly, if you replied the opposite, if a person said their goal was to make the most money, I'd tell them moving abroad is a really bad idea unless they are moving for a specific job offer.  
But when your goals are different, smart actions are different.",changemyview,0
"The fundamental issue with abortion has always come down to one simple question: when does life begin? 

We argue about rights, economics, children in the system, financial issues, etc, but it all comes down to, ""Are we removing a collection of unwanted cells from a woman's body or are we murdering a person?"" 

If you agree with me so far, then I'd like to posit that even non religious people can object to abortion based on their answer to that fundamental question. If they think that abortion is murder of a person, they will be against it regardless of the fact that they aren't religious because secular societies and secular laws also prohibit murder, and non religious people are also overwhelmingly against it. 

The title of your CMV is a very general statement about secular viewpoints (which is quite a wide and abstract term until we define it), but you've spent the majority of your post describing your own view as a non religious person/supporter of secularism. You don't think abortion is murder so you have no ethical issues with it. But if you did, you would take issue with it because (I presume) you take issue with murder in general which is a characteristic of secular systems. 

So it's less about religion/secularism and more about murder/not murder, which has always been the crux of the issue. Many secular societies have been making the move towards the ""not murder"" answer which is why women are given reproductive rights in a lot of secular countries, but that doesn't mean that there aren't individuals who - while not religious - still disagree with it.

She never opposed gay marriage.  She didn't support it as a policy goal.  That is a meaningful different.

Abortions have been performed for millennia. It wasn't even illegal until the 19th century. There are herbs, there are movements, there are sharp pointy things. [Wikipedia can tell you all about it](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/MqExtension).

The point is, most of those options are quite dangerous and tend to have all sorts of complications. Despite this, women keep doing them.

Hence, we offer safe legal abortions to meet a demand that would otherwise be met illegally. To save lives. You can debate about the conditions, I don't care. If a women is willing to put their own lives on the line to perform an abortion then I say let them.

People in their twenties don't talk about sex as much (or explicitly) as people in their teens, and less and less as you age (for the most part.. im looking at you dirty granpa).

I've met some 25 year old virgins and yeah, some are a bit socially inept because of it, some aren't. I also know people that have lost it way younger (age 12-14) and the same goes to them. It comes down to why, and it also comes down to the fact that sex is a natural part of life, and it does naturally raise questions in people's heads when someone of age hasn't experienced that yet. 

Does it really matter though? Not reaaally. But unfortunately a lot of virgins live through some hard times because of it, which is a shame. It goes back to the fact that it's a part of life, in your brain, in your genetics. 

So obviously it would be a bit hypocritical to say that it doesn't matter at all and you don't wonder at all why someone would be a virgin, since if it didn't somehow matter we wouldn't be talking about it.

The UN does have the power under Chapter 7 to do this but it is very very reluctant to do so because the end result is almost always going to be a shitshow and the UN will break down as an international system if it throws its weight around too much.

"No one knows how they will personally react to the reality of abortion. Forcing women to abort because their boyfriends/husbands want to ""financially abort"" denies women bodily autonomy, and is morally reprehensible. Even if someone promises on their mother's grave that they'll abort, that's still not a contract, and it should never be considered one. 

I understand that this seems unfair to you, and it well may be. That's the nature of biology. We're not completely and utterly equal about everything. The burden of gestation and birth (and potentially dying from giving birth) goes to the woman. The man is free to spread his seed and not see any side effects (except STDs). Because we recognize this is a woman's burden, we give her autonomy over her own body. Unfortunately for you, if your girlfriend decides she wants to keep it after all, and doesn't care that you don't, we still give priority to the child over the father or mother. 

This is because our society depends on parents providing for their own offspring. If the state had to pay for every ""financial abortion,"" we'd have more kids in poverty, an increase in taxes, and more men taking advantage of a system where they're free to ""sow their wild oats"" with no consequence.

In reality, the Skeptical position does not hold that you should decide something without evidence is false, it just holds that you should accept the uncertainty until new evidence arises.

As a working example, the original development of life on earth - there's no current certain answer as to how this first arose but a number of competing hypotheses.  The skeptical position is now to declare all answers false because there's no evidence to settle the question entirely, it's to weight and balance your position on the relative strength of the evidence behind each argument.  It's to say, ""Well maybe it arose from this particular source and that does look like the strongest at the moment, but on the other hand there's this argument against that and we can't dismiss that entirely"".

The philosophy of skepticism is not that we should declare a hypothesis false until they are proven beyond reasonable doubt, it's that we should be very careful about believing with any certainty in these.

"**To say ""women are more looks-focused"" is a fallacy**. To assume they didn't value looks before just because a patriarchal society forced them to choose otherwise is to presume you know what they found and find attractive as a gender. Perhaps they always valued looks, but only now are having the freedom to act on it. Imagine that.

Furthermore, you see guys slap on a random shirt for the club, while women are known to spend hours on makeup, wax, hair, nails, skin, dress, shoes, bags, etc. That doesn't make them superficial—they do it (for the sake of this argument) for men, because that's what matters mostly to men, while we have the luxury of not having to worry so much with looks because—frankly—women aren't as superficial as we are.

""Ballsy"" is, by far, one of the less desirable ""qualities"" in a man. Abuse and harassment happen in great part because of bold, ballsy, brave, brute men. All ""masculine qualities"". If you don't consider yourself beautiful (you can call it ""good looking"", if you prefer), be creative. Put the cover of your favourite book as your profile image—or a puppy, or your favourite sport/hobbie/place visited. **You're presuming women are only interested in looks and that's stopping you from showing far more important traits you might have**. Unless, of course, you're not looking for physical chemistry and connection with a woman, but rather a ""trophy"". Women are not as looks-focused as us, and the best sex and connection of your life will most certainly not be with the prettiest girl you hook up with. Trust me. (By ""pretty"" I mean the superficial judgement we make of other people's looks at a first glance, which changes)

I realize you might mean something different by ""ballsy""; you might mean ""having the balls to go up to a girl and talk to her"". In my book, that's not ""having balls"". That's just going up to and talking to someone without pre-conceptions or expectations. I really don't like the correlation between ""being a man"", ""having balls"" and ""taking what you want"". So messed up. Perhaps, if you considered yourself more beautiful and attractive, going up to a woman and talking to them wouldn't be considered ""having balls"". So perhaps you're assuming the women **you** (but not necessarily other people) find most attractive are of higher ""value"" than you?

That brings me to the point-based system for **judging the value** of other people. Let's say you meet a ""10"" today. Okay. The next day you meet another girl and you're totally fascinated by her. What is she, an 11? 12? Or do you have to judge her by the looks only, on this point-based scale? So maybe she's an 8? **YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH AN 8?!?**

Are you honestly interested in finding a girl you think is beautiful, have a good connection, like doing the same things, have great sex and that agrees with your lifestyle? Because the point-based system, to me, only seems useful to compare people based on looks, and for people who are more worried than they should with what other people will think.

So anyone complaining that ""women are more picky and looks-focused"" is most likely completely failing to recognise their own much more picky and looks-focused attitudes. Maybe us men should strive to be less looks-focused ourselves, instead of discussing ""the problem with women today"".",changemyview,0

The finance it by their buying choices which are limited at that, but supporting it is an entirely new level of involvement.  

If in the supermarket you had $1 burger made in a factory farm, and a $2 burger in a more humane farm, and a $5 burger in an animal paradise where only old animals are slaughtered in a painless way, and the consumers were clearly informed, then you could say their choice means something, specially wealthy customers than can afford all three.  What moral judgement would you pass on someone who has to feed kids with a minimum wage?  

However, this is not the case, you are sold a commodity piece of meat by default and have no say in the matter.  Eating meat is rather normal, however mistreating an animal in a city is not, so one is acceptable while the other isn't.  This is how morality works, and it evolves over time.  

Think about it.  How many people that buy their meat at the supermarket would be psychologically able to kill a cow themselves?  Give a number.  The rest, you can't accuse of doing the equivalent of being cruel to animals by only eating meat.  

What you can do is commend vegans for entirely adapting their lives around the animal industry, but given the modern eating habits, economy and culture, this is still a heavy burden on one's life and for many a decrease in quality or even health.

Suddenly your a lay person who uses recreational testosterone safely and knows just as much as a doctor (you don't). You think that if a side effect can be managed, a drug is safe. You think that if something is not overtly harmful right now it has no potential harming you in the long run (and no, this will not be studied, even if the drugs are unscheduled. Dosing people with something more than is medically necessary just to see what happens is unethical). You think that because you learned something and are doing it a way you feel is safe, every one should be allowed to do whatever they want with it because you want to.

&gt; [A fetus] doesn't even compare to a rodent in terms of cognitive capability and it is 100% dependent on the mother for its very life.

Because I do believe the line has to be drawn somewhere, the onset of sentience at all is as close to binary as it gets for me. On or off; is there a brain developing yet or not? The sanctity of life comes primarily from conscious experience of the life lived in my opinion. Since I don't believe in an individual soul, the emergence of humanity, from my current view, is that transition from embryo to fetus, not from the sperm occupying the egg or transplanting on the wall.

You still make a great point about even an embryo being....""less than"" a rodent and such and that gives the most credence to your next point

&gt;Given all that, it's clear that it's not entirely based on sentience - it has to be based on potential. 

You're killing it and making my stances difficult to defend. 

&gt;Why doesn't that potential exist from day one?

My main rebuttal would be that it's the *combination* or the merger of the two phenomenon (sentience's onset PLUS human potential) that makes the magic. 

If science could build a human from scratch, thus the potential is there, that does not mean we should start creating as many humans as possible. Potential by itself does not equate to a lot.

If there's no sentience at all, then I don't see how there's any case for the abortion at that stage to be considered murder.

But at the point those two things meet. You have the sentience that's come into existence ALREADY and it's come into existence WITH the potential to be fully developed. That's the true emergence of human life.

That's why humans have this innate feeling that human of any kind has more value than other animals. Only in extreme cases human might start to sway it's opinion.

Next we have the actual biological advantages of being human. Human is a highly sapient species. It interacts with nature in unprecedentent fashion in all of Earth's history.

In the US, people are usually more descriptive when they want to insult a white person: hillbilly, redneck, hipster, hippy, republican, democrat, southerner, Jew, fatty, faggot, evangelicals, godless atheists, etc. 

I'd also add that the majority of times I've seen/experienced racist slurs is not from some ideology of racial superiority but from heat of the moment anger and just looking for the words that would be most insulting. With minorities, racial slurs are usually the most hurtful. With white people (again, I don't mean to presume your feelings on being referred to as a cracker), a general purpose catch-all term like cracker just doesn't pack enough punch to have much effect in a verbal argument. I'd imagine that's why this white person decided to add ""faggot ass"" to his ""racial slur"" since ""cracker"" alone would come off as a really weak insult. ",changemyview,0
"Yes. They have been harassed and accused. More prevalent, however, is that they're made to feel unwelcome and unwanted. Don't women say similar things about the workplace?

I have seen it firsthand. I work at a retail store. Last month, my manager came to me and told me to keep an eye out, because a man had come in with a little girl, and that little girl was mixed, and he wasn't, so it probably wasn't his child. Women come in with children that don't look like them all the time and occasion no comment. But my manager wanted me to follow this customer because she thought it odd that a man would be with a kid that wasn't his.

Perhaps the culture is different in your culture. If so, that's great. But here, it is a real issue. Just like women fear what people will say if they don't wear makeup or don't want kids, men have their own issues and fears, too.

"Is your suggestion to prevent a certain type of situation (male sexually approaches female, is rejected, then becomes abusive) or is it a early warning system?

If its the former -  You are talking about a very particular situation that you want entire society to change for.  That is unreasonable - you don't make everyone change their ways because some people can't take rejection.  

Also, it creates this perverse justification for rape.  Female sexually approaches male, female then changes her mind but its too late since under your social norms she literally asked for it.  ""I put up a fake profile on Tinder and she sexually approached me, it would be rude for her to not have sex with me.""  You make it more socially acceptable for men to rape.  It doesn't improve things if she can reject at any point since you are now back at the situation you wanted to avoid (i.e. she rejects and he becomes abusive).

If its the later - as I mentioned, its too easily circumvented and trains women to rely on a weak warning system, won't actually prevent sexual approaches (social norms won't prevent this) and there is already a ""early warning system"" right now.  ",changemyview,0
"&gt;Many of the poorer countries (Greece in particular) have been treated badly by Germany

The EU has virtually no control over fiscal policy, the severe recession in Greece is due to the Greek government over-borrowing due to the lower borrowing rates available to it as an EU member. After the crash EU nations gave Greece a bailout of €110 billion on the conditions that Greece follows a strict austerity policy. I think given the huge sum of money and high risk of default the demands weren't unreasonable. They proved insufficient though and a second bailout of €130 billion was necessary. 

You may be thinking that the reason austerity didn't work in Greece because The EU's austerity plan was poorly conceived. Ireland however went through a similarly severe recession and was given a €85 billion bailout and also told to follow a strict austerity plan as well. Ireland is now out of the recession and has the fastest growing economy in the EU.

Where do they buy those shoes? Who takes them off the cargo ship? Who transports them to a distribution center? Who negotiates the contracts with the store carrying them?

In China what happens when people there have higher incomes and start buying US high-skilled products &amp; services we export?

&gt; If we instead cut taxes for the wealthy, and incentivise them to stay in the US, then the more successful they are, the more they sell, the more they are forced to employ US labour, the more demand for labour the higher the wages, the higher the wages, the more people can spend causing self-sustaining growth.

1. Manufacturing employment declined in the US mostly due to technology not trade. Manufacturing share of output has remained relative steady for decades.
2. We don't want manufacturing employment back; the jobs we have instead pay more, have better working conditions and improve other outcomes like health (as well as social improvements due to increasing education).
3. Cutting taxes on the wealthy would have very limited impact on domestic employment, I doubt we would be able to even measure it.

"Leaving aside whether there are some justice concerns in society regarding height (it is, after all, odd that CEOs are much taller on average), let me address your conditional statement.

On one hand, sure, logic seems fine. Everyone has preferences, and only some deeply weird views of justice require that we control for attractiveness in who we want to date. So, it seems like I'm on board so far. The problem is that it isn't so easy to defend *every* instance of dating preference simply on that basis.

It is well-established that ""personal choice and preference"" has been routinely used as an excuse to *simply be racist*. See, for example, this article from [Salon on George Wallace](http://www.salon.com/2013/12/22/how_the_gop_became_the_white_mans_party/):

&gt;His second startling realization was that he, George Wallace, had figured out how to exploit that pervasive animosity. The key lay in seemingly non-racial language. At his inauguration, Wallace had defended segregation and extolled the proud Anglo-Saxon Southland, thereby earning national ridicule as an unrepentant redneck. Six months later, talking not about stopping integration but about states’ rights and arrogant federal authority—and visually aided by footage showing him facing down a powerful Department of Justice official rather than vulnerable black students attired in their Sunday best—Wallace was a countrywide hero. “States’ rights” was a paper-thin abstraction from the days before the Civil War when it had meant the right of Southern states to continue slavery. Then, as a rejoinder to the demand for integration, it meant the right of Southern states to continue laws mandating racial segregation—a system of debasement so thorough that it “extended to churches and schools, to housing and jobs, to eating and drinking … to virtually all forms of public transportation, to sports and recreations, to hospitals, orphanages, prisons, and asylums, and ultimately to funeral homes, morgues, and cemeteries.” That’s what “states’ rights” defended, though in the language of state-federal relations rather than white supremacy. Yet this was enough of a fig leaf to allow persons queasy about black equality to oppose integration without having to admit, to others and perhaps even to themselves, their racial attitudes.

So, this is going to be another instance of me trying to figure out what people on Reddit think ""racist"" means, which often makes my head explode, but here we go: If ""racist"" means ""acting so as to discriminate against a person because that race is inherently inferior."" then nearly nothing that we talk about as ""racist"" is actually racist. Many people are happy to say ""Yes! Thank you. Finally."" and move on to saying that police never act with bias, hiring practices are fair, and affirmative action is the REAL racism.

Secondly, racism in society is well-established as [affecting socially constructed standards, like beauty and attractiveness.](http://www.naacpldf.org/brown-at-60-the-doll-test) The reason that this Doll test was so influential in *Brown v Board of Education* was to show that intentional bias was not necessary to demonstrate ill effects and injustice. So there are two potential problems with your view from what I can see. One is a question of motivational uncertainty... how can a black person know that it just preference for skin tone rather than racism that is the operational reason behind someones action. And secondly, there is good reason to think that standards that have a racial component are, at least in part, the result of unjustified racial bias. 

Of course many things are socially influenced...height, race, sex, eye color, nose shape, whatever else may be. The question is what to do about it on an individual and social level... on your view, we may simply ignore them. I don't think that the answer is that simple. ",changemyview,0

That's inconsequential to my response, I'm not arguing for any particular view of punishment.

&gt;But rehabilitation? How is jail time correlated with the rehabilitation of two people who set out to commit the exact same crime based on whether one was successful and the other one failed?

So rehabilitation, in its purest form, is completely detached from punishing crimes at all... it is based on fixing people. I should have been more precise here: What I should have said is that rehabilitation doesn't justify punishing A and B at the same level, it only justifies treating every case individually. On a pure rehabilitation view if You, I, A, or B commit the same crime, we should be reintroduced into society when we are fixed. If it takes you a day and me a year, that's fair on such a view. 

I was viewing rehabilitation in the typical way that many people do: certain crimes demand an approximate range of punishment depending on the case. Here, actually being responsible for the outcome would be a good shorthand for justifying more punishment. That might blur the justifications here

&gt;As for deterrence it undoubtedly isn't more justified in either case. If you want to deter people from commiting murder, where is the connection between that and the eventual success or lack thereof by any given criminal? Are they going to assess their likelihood of succeeding and then think, 'Okay I'm a really good killer so if I do this right it'll get me more time, better not'?
I'm trying to understand how either case is more justified in the scope of a successful crime.

So, I explained how punishing A and B equivalently has a paradoxical effect - someone who initially fails in a crime is now incentivized to follow through on the murder because the punishment can't get any worse - that's a bad outcome. The deterrence view is based on avoiding bad outcomes. Punishing B more than A has the best outcome (on balance and other things being equal).",changemyview,0

Psychology would be focusing on how people become happy. This is an objective part of the field, that's why we have psychologists. Mental wellness is happiness.

Bad things the hardcore liberals want (at least in America) are to let refugees in without much proper vetting as long as a politician with a (D) in front of their name says it will be fine and the relinquishing of all legal firearms.

Most liberals are ok with accepting refugees, but they're talking very small amounts. Personally I think it would be better if they stayed in Turkey but first world countries helped them, for example by paying for their relocation and trying to mitigate any other problems afterwards (which is still way cheaper than letting them stay in the first world).

However even those in favour of taking them to the first world, well, it isn't that horrifying. Also taking away legal firearms is a first but essential step towards taking away illegal firearms (a painful, dangerous first step though), and it's not comparable to, say, taking away the right of a woman to stop a pregnancy (at an early stage) or discriminating against women or black people (note that while women's are doing about as well as men now, many conservatives believe that they should be housewives preferentially). I mean, not to go full crazy feminist here, but a woman can have her life ruined by a child she didn't want, and having firearms is more of a hobby or symbolism.

You seem to be coming from a very utilitarian perspective so let me elaborate on your position. Forced medical trials on a very small percentage of the population would be beneficial to the advancement of humanity and the overall well-being of people. But rather than pursue this, we agree that all humans have certain rights.*

Why? Why do humans as individuals have rights, if those rights can get in the way of the advancement and well-being of the overall population?

The exact answer is very widely debated and I'm sure you'll have very strong opinions on it, but do you agree that if humans can have rights simply by being alive then it follows that other animals should too?

The main counter to this argument is either theological (God made humans special, do what you want with the rest of the animals) or scientific (can they experience suffering?). As you haven't mentioned religion I'll skip right past that and move onto science. Are you confident that chickens, pigs, cows etc. can't suffer? If not, then it follows:

Humans get individual rights, even if they hold back the advancement and well-being of humanity. Humans are just one species of animal therefore all animals should have some form of rights unless you can demonstrate that they're incapable of suffering.

There are two ways to think about inequalities in a society. You're taking a view based in statistical inequality, whereas I'm more interested in a view based on social dynamics. Now, I'm not *uninterested* in statistics, and I'm sure you're not entirely uninterested in the social world divorced from quantities, but, based of your argument, it looks like where I would say that statistical inequalities are symptomatic of a wider problem, you're arguing that the statistical inequalities are themselves the problem. 

We're essentially asking different questions: you're considering if you'd rather be a man or a woman in society, whereas I'm asking if you'd rather be a man qua man or a woman qua woman in society. 

To demonstrate the difference, imagine there's some Rawlsian veil of ignorance type scenario and we're hovering above the world not knowing who we'll be. Your argument suggests that the way we decide if women or men have it better is to think which we would rather be holding fixed that we're one or the other (like being randomly assigned to a random man or a random woman depending on our choice). I'm saying the 'true' test of inequality is actually to hold fixed everything else: would you rather be a homeless man or a homeless woman, would you rather be a male CEO or a female CEO etc. etc. If you knew that it wouldn't effect the statistical likelihood of class, race, occupation, imprisonment and so on, would you rather be a man or a woman.

I'll go on later, but I'll give you a chance to respond. Can you see where I'm going with this?",changemyview,0

"&gt;Moreover, like I said, the biggest issue is the burden on our welfare systems. 

You have zero evidence supporting this claim... I literally gave you a meta-analysis which indicates that a preponderance of the evidence in the literature says that immigrants have a net positive impact on public finance. That means they generally pay more in taxes than they take. You literally can't just say things like that without evidence to back you up.

&gt;A meta analysis doesn't really help. Science isn't done by consensus. The problem with economics is you can get any answer you want, it's a soft science.

There aren't many things that economists agree on. In fact I read somewhere that they disagree more than politicians do on most issues (can't find the article right now). But there is only a small set of issues where economists achieve consensus and this is one of them. If nothing else, the meta-analysis study easily outweighs the evidence you bring up, which is none at all. 

&gt;Inflation is not below 2%. The general CPI is calculated using a basket of goods that is not distributed based on the total market percentage of that basket, but by how large the inflationary discrepancy for that basket is. This by nature will reduce the overall number. For basic items like food, inflation is dramatically higher than 2%.

1. Gee thanks I guess I'll just take your word for it.

2. The price index I linked to wasn't CPI... it was PCE which is the prefered measure of inflation used by the Fed. 

3. Food prices are extremely volatile and that makes it generally a bad indicator of inflation. That's why the Fed tends to exclude it in favor of core inflation. Food prices can be influenced by factors such as the environment or weather. This is not monetary policy creating inflation its other factors beyond the Fed's control 

&gt;The economy is not stable. If you think the Federal reserve creates stability, I really don't know what to tell you. They accelerate and amplify the business cycle so it occurs more frequently and more profoundly each time. This is primarily due to distortions of interest rates. But I'm guessing you haven't read much Friedrich Hayek.

I am a market monetarist. Fredrich Hayek would have said the exact same I said in my original response. He would have said that the central bank should have been more inflationary. In his book [Prices and Production](https://mises.org/system/tdf/Prices%20and%20Production_5.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document) he advocates for what would later be called Hayek's Rule for monetary policy. Hayek's rule is essentially a special case of the productivity norm rule where the factors of production are assumed to be constant. Essentially, what Hayek's rule states is that nominal GDP should remain constant along a stable growth path and the central bank should intervene in order to correct any deviation from the path. Nominal GDP growth was decreasing as early as 2006 but the Fed refused to increase the monetary base until late 2008, well into the worst parts of the crisis. You should read more Hayek. 

&gt;Everything else you said boils down to the same thing I said earlier, you have your references and studies and articles to prove your point, I could go google my own, and it would accomplish nothing at all because modern economic ""science"" is more or less a charade. 

1. ""I don't like to change my views in the face of new evidence presented to me even though I'm on a subreddit called /r/changemyview.""

I really think that nukes were on the minds of the UN's founders. The UN was formed under the shadow of Hiroshima and I think it played into discussions most definitely.

It's true that the permanent members don't totally reflect current global power relations but I wouldn't go overboard on that. Start with nukes: under the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty, only the five permanent members of the UN are allowed to have nukes; India's, Pakistan's etc.. are technically illegal. Furthermore by most counts the US and Russia have about 7000 nukes each; Britain, France and China 300 or so each, Israel, India and Pakistan less than 100 and North Korea less than 10. So the P5 are really in a league of their own. Not to mention the P5 have long range missile and/or strategic bomber capabilities and no one else does. So the P5 really are still the only *real* nuclear powers. Even forgetting nukes, the P5 represent 4 of the top 6 biggest economies economies, and the one that isn't on that list - Russia - has one of the world's most powerful armies. So it's not like they're complete global nonentities.

&gt;The Fed shouldn't have intervened in 08, because they were the cause of the 08 crash.

Yes the Fed was responsible for the 2008 crash, but they're only responsible insofar as they failed to intervene and increase inflation when the growth rate of NGDP started falling (at least according to [market monetarists](http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/09/14/scott-sumner/real-problem-was-nominal) like Hayek).

&gt;Hayek advocated for intervention only when the cause wasn't an inherent distortion from the source of the problem in the first place (Fed distorting interest rates).

Did you read the book I posted? He literally wanted to stabilize nominal GDP which was starting to fall [as early as 2006](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=7xwL). 
&gt;It is quite conceivable that a, distortion of relative prices and a misdirection of production by monetary influences could only be avoided if, firstly, the total **money stream remained constant**, and secondly, all prices were completely flexible, and, thirdly, all long term contracts were based on a correct anticipation of future price
movements (Hayek 131). 

When Hayek says ""money stream"" he's talking about the equation of exchange: MV=Py. 

&gt;From now onward the term ""amount of money in circulation"" or even shortly ""the quantity of money"" will be used for what should more exactly be described as the effective **money stream** or the amount of money payments made during a unit period of time (Hayek 27).

These are Hayek's words not mine. You're straight up wrong about what he thinks of monetary policy.
&gt; ...the only exception to the general rule that, in order that money should remain neutral towards prices, the amount of money or the **amount of money payments should remain invariable.** But the situation becomes different as soon as we take into account the possibility of changes in methods of payment which make it possible for a given amount of money to effect a larger or smaller number of payments during a period of time than before. Such **a change in the ""velocity of circulation""** has rightly always been considered as equivalent to a change in the amount of money in circulation, and though, for reasons which it would go too far to explain here, I am not particularly enamoured of the concept of an average velocity of circulation. it will serve as sufficient justification of the general statement that **any change in the velocity of circulation would have to be compensated by a reciprocal change in the amount of money** in circulation if money is to remain neutral towards prices (Hayek 123-4).

He's saying here that he wants to stabilize nominal GDP. Any change in money velocity - V - should be met with a reciprocal change in the money supply - M - or in other words, the equation of exchange - MV=Py - must remain constant.",changemyview,0

"&gt; How do you feel about prescription medications? Do you think all drugs should be available over the counter? Anabolic steroids are some of the most powerful drugs available to doctors. They have important clinical benefits in people who are sick, but have significant and deadly side effects listed below. It's very easy to overdose on them, and they need to be carefully monitored by doctors when they are being used. With all drugs, the dose makes the poison Unless you are a doctor, it's very difficult to stay within the right range. The reason why this is especially troubling is that unless you have a significant illness, your body already produces the correct amount of testosterone.

There are a lot of false things in this paragraph i'll try to get all of them. I think absolutely all drugs should be available OTC, not literally in the sense that the pharmacy should stock all of them all the time, but maybe some system where you can order from a book. idk that's not the point. 'its very easy to overdose on them' what does that even mean? steroids have to be some of the hardest drugs ever to OD on because you have to inject them into your muscle and have the dosage release over weeks at a time. unless by OD you mean 'take more than the average medical dosage'. and oral steroids are literally just as easy to OD than any other pill medication. 'unless you are a doctor it's very difficult to stay in range', again not true. steroids are an extremely straightfoward drug. you literally only have to dose once a week. 'unless you have a significant illness your body already produces enough test', you realize after ~25 years old the body's hormone production slows down every year, right? you really think a 60 year old man produces as much test as an 18 year old?  it doesn't really seem like you are knowledgeable about what steroids actually are and how they are used. 

man, you can list all the side effects you want. want me to go on find all the side effects for advil and list them too? i'm not going through all of these one by one. also all of those neuropsychiatric side effects are false, in my OP i linked a study which disproved 'roid rage'. I agree that no doctor would willingly give a bunch of steroids to a patient, that's exactly why they need to be available without a doctor. because the burden of choice then falls on the user and the user alone. you say 'it's not worth the risk' well who are you to decide that? every time i drink i run the risk of choking on my own vomit, every time i drive i run the risk of getting in an accident. life is full of risk. just because somethings are relatively more risky than others doesn't make a difference.

"Do you think happiness is the end goal of progress?  Your post and comments reminded me of a quote by a historian, JB Bury.  In 1920 he wrote 
&gt;To the minds of most people the desirable outcome of human development would be a condition of society in which all the inhabitants of the planet would enjoy a perfectly happy existence....It cannot be proved that the unknown destination towards which man is advancing is desirable. The movement may be Progress, or it may be in an undesirable direction and therefore not Progress..... The Progress of humanity belongs to the same order of ideas as Providence or personal immortality. It is true or it is false, and like them it cannot be proved either true or false. Belief in it is an act of faith.

The idea of progress emerged from the Enlightenment in the 18th century.   Locke, Voltaire, Rousseau, and Kant all wrote about the idea of progress. They inspired American's such as Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, and John Adams.  Individual liberty and the American Dream are rooted in the idea of progress.

Social progress cannot be measured by the feelings of individuals because the idea of progress is about the result on all of humankind - the result of progress is the improvement of the human condition.  It is demonstrably true that the human condition today is magnitudes of order better than even 200 years ago.  The advancments made in science, technology, and engineering have had huge impacts on the lives of humans all over the world.  While there will be individuals who struggle and suffer, the overall human condition continues to improve.  Are people happier today than they were in the past?  I don't know, and I don't think happiness is the best measurement.  I think happiness is a state of being that is the result of doing something that brings pleasure.  It isn't the normal state of being.  I think contentment is the state of being that is the best measurement.  Contentment means you aren't suffering and are not in need of something.  If all humans could be content I think we will have reached the peak of progress.  ",changemyview,0

"&gt;During early stages of development, most organisms are more adapted to environments that are distinct from the ones adults live in. If you take a tadpole and put it on land it will die, but it is still the same genus and species as the adult form, just a couple months younger. If you break a (fertilized) chicken egg, you will have killed the chick because you removed it from its developmental environment. If you knock a cocoon off of a tree, you kill the butterfly inside of it. This is no different than a human fetus. Life is simply more vulnerable as it develops.

I reject this comparison. Is an egg a chicken? Is a tadpole a frog? Is a caterpillar a butterfly? No. No. No. Is a fetus a human? No. It has the potential to become a human, but then so does a zygote, so does an unfertilized egg. But, unlike a tadpole or a caterpillar, an egg and a fetus aren't alive. Not only do they die if moved outside of their natural habitat, but they can't maintain homeostasis by their own actions (they require another organism actively working for their benefit to sustain themselves). A cold egg can't warm itself by moving into the sun, it can only wait and hope ma-chicken returns. A tadpole can swim to warmer waters and eat its own food. 

Now you can argue that just hatched chickens need to be fed, and babies don't leave the womb capable of fully taking care of themselves, and I agree. But they are at that point capable of doing things to maintain homeostasis, which may be as limited as signalling for help (crying), which they are incapable of before that point.

You can't use the 'potential life' definition, because you have to do exactly what you've done previously which is arbitrarily say that a zygote is when there is the right amount of 'potential'. That is, something that isn't alive, but is in some arbitrary categories indistinguishable from something that is alive has enough potential to be alive to matter. Whereas something that doesn't meet this arbitrary subset is not potentially life. That strikes me as a very weak argument.

So, I care about something being alive. Which I believe is reached when the organism can take action to maintain homeostasis. Then, a human person needs to be alive, otherwise they are not human or a person. So something that can live outside the womb is capable of attempting to maintain its homeostasis, and is therefore alive. 

This also explain why its more appropriate than conception, I'm not using a definition that relies on some arbitrary 'potential to be a human person', but instead simply on whether something is alive or not. That feels much less contrived and much more internally consistent to me.

&gt;For legal consistency, is 13 weeks too early of a cutoff date for personhood given that the earliest viable baby ever born was at 21 weeks?

Yes, I think so. I think its more for political reasons and feelings (""this looks too much like a baby""). Many states ban abortion after 22 weeks, which to me is a fairly reasonable time. At that point, the fetus may or may not be alive, and things should be handled with much more care since we are dealing now with a living being capable of surviving outside of the woman, and not a not-yet-alive-thing-in-the-womb.",changemyview,0

"Gaaaaahhhhh..... you're outside the scenario :p.  I said ""if 100 people want chairs"" and he has 150.  So he has 50% more chairs than people want.. It was an attempt to make big numbers easier numbers. 

There are a finite number of digital recordings of a song (songs take energy, and energy in the universe is limited) but we say it's unlimited because (once it's produced) the supply so far outnumbers the demand. That was the point behind 150 chairs; there are more chairs than anyone would want to buy, but stealing his chair is still stealing.  

The ultimate point still comes down to timing.  Before the carpenter made the chairs, there was absolute scarcity. Before 343 makes Halo 6, there is absolute scarcity.

"&gt;Yes these low interest rates have helped Greece, and yes they have made many mistakes in terms of funding, but an almost deconstructing of their governments budget will do nothing to help them recover.

But it did. Without the bailout Greece would have had to default, this would have meant that its borrowing interest rate would have skyrocketed and remember greece defaulted five times in the modern era. Without the low interest rates afforded to it by being a member there's no way it can develop its infrastructure or make any significant investment no matter how vital it is. Greece's GDP per person increased by about 25% due to its EU membership nearly reaching the EU average, that's an incredible improvement. 

I'm not trying to dismiss the hardship the Greek people went through due to austerity but Greece's vulnerability to economic volatility was due to overspending. If a federal EU made the investment instead it would have been insulated due to is size.

&gt;This just shows that a ""United states of Europe"" would not work, as each area has different views and values. This economic crisis in Greece has showed the flaws of the single currency, can while I accept that Germany cannot be blamed for this, the fact remains that this idea of one currency between 2 nations who want different currency values doesn't work.

I think it was working. The problem in my view is that the EU is juggling so many different economies without being able to create a federal fiscal policy. Every country areas with different views and values having a larger country won't make it a whole lot more difficult. Despite all the fear mongering the US economy is in relatively good shape and I think its fair to say that overall the american experiment after all this time has been a success and proves that a project of this scale can be successfully implemented.

&gt; a federal Europe wouldn't reduce corruption hugely as they would have much more to deal with due to it covering more people accused of evading taxes.

It can't get rid of it but it can reduce it. A lot of Greece's problems stem from corruption, a less corrupt governing body could implement policies to thwart this behaviour. Having a lot more to deal with won't necessarily hinder its ability in combating corruption as it can have advisory bodies throughout the union. Its true that the new union will have corruption itself but it won't be as corrupt as Greece and will have a huge incentive to ensure this will never happen again.

I think the single market has been an enormous benefit to europe. It has allowed goods and services to cross countries without tariffs and extra taxes. It has allowed poorer nations to get access to cheaper borrowing rates, this has lead to some over-using it but that's why I think a moderating federal government could be vital. I think Europe is in general less belligerent then then USA and if it had a single army it could act as a counterweight that could stand up to it, hopefully moderating some of its more aggressive policies. Obviously war is sometimes necessary but it should be used as a last resort. Overall I think a federal Europe would suffer from many of the issues the USA has but don't let the current turmoil fool you the USA has been incredibly successful in many ways and I think a second superpower could help moderate its excesses and help it oppose the threats the world faces today.

My point is that there is definitely something different about Islam compared to other religions (as it stands right now) and the evidence is that when I say the word ""terrorism"", you think ""Islam"", not any other religion. Whether it's because other religions have gone through a reform, or if it's fundamentally a problem with Islam, that's definitely a discussion that can be had.

But my point is that Islam needs to change. And I don't think most people admit this. They instantly see it as bigoted or racist against these people and quickly rush to tell me about other extremists, as if terrorism from other religions is happening to the same degree as it is from Islam.

"&gt;Everyone here agrees with libertarianism on the social side more or less

Maybe, but certainly not nationwide.  The two least libertarian (socially as well as economically) candidates ever won their respective primaries.

&gt;Switzerland, Sweden, etc are more economically prosperous than economies closer to libertarianism.

There aren't many economies closer to libertarianism than Switzerland or Sweden though.  I know that Sweden has a socialist reputation, but it's not totally warranted.  It's got to be in the top fifth of libertarian nations (and was even [better](http://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/how-laissez-faire-made-sweden-rich) when it had the economic gains that permitted the expansion of its safety net).  There is minimal government corruption, strong respect for property rights, an equal application of the rule of law, and laws are applied pretty evenly and fairly.  Income taxes are high, but are not very progressive.  There is a lower corporate tax than the US, and again this is applied relatively equally.  Businesses face limited regulation, less than the US except when it comes to labor regulations.  It's likely easier to start a business in Sweden than the US.  Market regulations are applied relatively evenly.  Tariffs are relatively low.  Banks have limited regulations.

Switzerland, meanwhile, is one of the most libertarian countries in the world economically.  It has minimal government corruption, strong respect for property rights, and laws are applied equally and fairly.  Money isn't pegged, business regulations are pretty low, and labor regulations are pretty business friendly.  Government spending is low for how rich it is.  Investment is relatively unrestricted.  Banks have a free hand.  Tariffs are almost nonexistent.  Maybe Hong Kong and Singapore are more economically libertarian than Switzerland, but not many other nations could even come close.

&gt;What is the definition of whats too far and whats acceptable for government? The constitution?

I mean, legally the Constitution is.  In terms of what I'd call Libertarian, I'd say anyone who wants to reduce the overall impact of government from what currently exists is on the Libertarian side and anyone who wants a net increase isn't.  What would I call libertarian in general?

So in general, I'd say that Libertarianism favors less impact on daily life (including economic/financial life).  This isn't as simple as ""how high are taxes"", though of course that's part of it.  Consider the extreme case where the government levied a 100% tax on all income and then gave the income right back to the people it had taxed one hour later.  You could call that ruinous taxation and out-of-control spending, but in practice the impact would be minimal.  

So with regard to taxation, libertarianism would want the government to avoid picking winners and losers (including avoiding taxes being too progressive), would want the impact to be as low as possible, would want to avoid special tax breaks for favored people or favored activities, would want the taxes to be spent on things people would want to buy anyway, would want no opportunities for corruption or for government ministers to reward their friends, etc.  

Thus, if we're talking about health care, I'd call the ACA less Libertarian than Sweden's, the UK's, or France's system.  We've heavily regulated insurance companies, to the extent that they're told almost exactly what to offer, and are given special treatment to make sure they don't lose much money.  We've given special breaks for some kinds of treatments and not others.  It's almost impossible to pay out of pocket, etc.  Favored group get breaks on insurance.  Favored companies get waivers from the law.  It would be more libertarian than this to just say ""everyone pays X% tax, and everyone is covered for basic care"".  It would be more libertarian still to completely deregulate health care, of course.

Likewise when it comes to welfare, a purely voluntary system would be the maximally libertarian position.  But Basic Income would be more Libertarian than what we have, even if it's more expensive.  The more opportunities for graft, individual corruption, or politically connected groups to get special treatment, the less Libertarian a system is.  The more that benefits depend on behaving like the government wants, depend on making specific marriage choices, specific occupational choices, specific educational choices to keep your benefits, the less Libertarian it is.

"I'm not assuming, I'm making guesses, sometimes subconsciously? It's not so much ""I know for a fact that that person is gay"", but more like ""Okay that person might be gay"". If another guy ogles a woman, I'm going to guess that he's straight, or at least bi. If another guy ogles a guy, I'm going to guess he's gay or bi. 

Of course there can be other reasons for someone to do any of those small things. But typically if someone, say, never refers to their partner by name or gender, at least in my experience, it means their partner is of the same sex. Not always! But often. Straight people usually have no reason to do so in a conscious manner. *I* spent a decade trying to hide this stuff from people around me - I know the tricks to do so. It's probably more difficult to fool someone who's been in the same situation. You've used the same excuses, the way creative language, and so on.

And you know what? About half the time I have these hunches, they turn out to be true. So there's probably something to it, or I'd be wrong waaay more often than that. So in the end, I think it's just about being observant about how people behave, and being gay yourself (or perhaps having many gay friends) might make it easier to recognise small clues. 

There's nothing offensive about drawing conclusions from people's behaviours. If I see someone wearing a cross around their neck, I'll probably assume that they are, or at least, were, religious.

&gt;4) A secular holiday tangentially related to the feast day was established, adopting a bunch of folk traditions. Some people claim the folks traditions are pagan. The date also coincides with the alleged pre-Christian Celtic Festival

this one doesn't even make sense. cite a source that it 'was established', instead of occurring organically as most folk traditions do.

and since pagan just means 'not christian' (as I already proved using *your definition*), this isn't 'some people claim'.

all this, despite the fact that what is practiced as 'Halloween' in the US and the UK has all the hallmarks of the *pagan* festival of Samhain, and non of the religious ones associated with your 'All Hallows Eve'.

Just fucking let it go. nobody is trying to pull down your whole fucking religion here; it harms you and your religion none at all to go 'eh, you're probably right.

I assume that if FGM was done when they're 18 you would be ok with it, wouldn't you?

&gt;I don't know fundamentalist Muslim families. I know many Muslim families, and none of them impose the hijab on women. Families in which some women have chosen to wear the hijab while others chose not too.

The hijab is to the burka what a moderate nationalist is to the fucking nazis. A family that dresses its daughters in hijabs might not be too harsh if one of them chooses not to (or even at all). A family that dresses its daughters in burkas is crazy fundamentalistic, not because of this act itself, but rather because while moderate muslims are alright with the hijab, only a extreme muslim would put a full burka into them. Compare a parent who might hit their kids once if they do something stupid to a parent who beats them up for looking at him at the eyes.

&gt;But, I think you're making the mistake here of assuming that the burqa is necessarily imposed on women. Women who wear them very well may themselves be fundamentalists who choose to wear the burqa as a part of their belief system.

Fundamendalists don't grow from normal tolerant families, you're so ridiculously deluded I didn't think people like you existed. So you think it's normal for a fundamentalistic muslim family (no moderate muslim even considers putting a burka in his daughters) to let them have a choice and learn about how non-fundamentalists are and be empowered?

By allowing women to be fundamentalistic, you're also allowing their families the freedom to indoctrinate them into a deeply, insanely sexist culture. Your position is as ridiculous as taking a gun from a policeman and giving it back to a murderer caught in the act because the policeman has no right to take his guns away from him. I'm not exaggerating, you're shooting yourself in the knee by saying that women would be freer if we allowed them to act on the beliefs their family imposed into them.

The government has the right of eminent domain so they can build something in your backyard, but the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is a federally recognized Indian tribe and has some additional standing of sovereignty. 

2. There is a greater risk of environmental damage via pipeline than with a train. A train can spill all of its oil on the ground, and it won't cause that much damage. But if an oil pipeline leaks into a water reservoir, it will keep spilling oil until the water is ruined. This might be an unlikely circumstance, but there are plenty of recent examples where this has happened. There is a movie about the Deepwater Horizon in theaters right now. They said the same thing about the limited risk when building it, and it spewed oil for months. It wasn't even the oil company that solved it. It was a government team led by Obama's Nobel Prize winning Energy Secretary, Steven Chu who [figured out how to plug the hole.](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-science-stopped-bp-gulf-of-mexico-oil-spill/)

3. By making shipping oil cheaper, it increases supply of oil, which will lower the price and increase consumption. This means that people will use even more oil than before. This means that in addition to the short term environmental problems of digging up all that natural space and drilling for more oil, there will be more long term problems related to global warming as well.

4. There is a major economic problem with drilling for oil right now too. Oil is dirt cheap right now. A barral costs half as much as it did last year. There is too much supply of oil in the world at the moment, and the most economically efficient thing to do is to reduce supply overall to match.

"Why is it offensive to be assumed to be gay? I think the notion that it's bad to be seen as gay is more offensive than the practice of actually guessing whether or not someone is gay. If being ""straight"" and ""gay"" are morally equal, then at worst it's inconvenient.

Gaydar's purpose isn't to detect every gay person - it's to identify some gay people. Like it or not, the ""gay accent"" and that certain way of walking are more common traits in gay men than in straight men. I'd argue that this isn't biological so much as social (e.g. straight men who have these traits feel more pressure to conform to gender norms and hide them, so you see them expressed more often in gay men). Either way, expressing these traits are then a positive signal for homosexuality.

Also, speaking as a gay man, gaydar can actually be incredibly convenient. When your potential dating pool is roughly 3% of the population, it's much harder to find someone without going out of your way for it (i.e. going to a gay bar, using a gay app, joining a gay sports team). If you meet someone in public who triggers your gaydar, you know you have a better shot and it might actually be worth approaching (as opposed to 97% of people who you have absolutely no shot with). It's also often convenient when other people use it, so you don't constantly have to ""come out"" to new people you meet, which gets tedious.",changemyview,0

"&gt; with objectively better answers 

I don't think this is a fair statement.  I think the truth is more like, ""with sometimes more technically correct, but less accessible answers""

Here's the first answer to the top post on ""askscience"" at the moment (about why sponges get hard when dry):

&gt;The main reason for the effect you see is that common synthetic sponges made of cellulose are often treated with softening agents during their manufacturing. For example, take a look at this patent:

&gt;&gt;The sponge is washed with water [...] then immersed for 10 minutes in an impregnating composititon containing softener and hydrogen peroxide at a temperature of 55 C. The impregnating composition, which is freshly made and substantially colorless, consists of 6.25 parts of hydroxypropyl sorbitol, 10.50 parts of diethylene glycol, 6.75 parts of urea, 0.25 part of dihydroabietyl amine, [...]

There's certainly nothing ELI5 about a response that talks about ""hydroxypropyl sorbitol"".

Meanwhile, the top post on ELI5, is about how life returns to dry ponds.  The top post is:

&gt;Many aquatic animals are able to lay eggs that can dry up and go dormant until they get rehydrated again. Algae leaves spores that do the same.

The second is:

&gt;You also have fish hatcheries and farms that raise large populations of fish (for example trout) and then deliver them via trucks with large holding tanks on them to wherever a population boost is needed. So even some isolated farmer's backyard pond that's not even remotely close to a water channel can end up with a thriving fish population.

I think that's a pretty significant difference in accessibility.

Personally, I think it would be good if ELI5 posted a list of ""related subs"" in a ""For more detailed information, you might want to check out these subs"", or even sent it as an automated message to posters, but there are valid reasons to prefer ELI5. ",changemyview,0

"So, as I understand you argument (all premises assumed true):

&gt;P: If an alien civilization creates computers and doesn't destroy itself, then it will eventually create an AI. (T)

&gt;P: If an AI is created, then super intelligent AI is possible. (T)

&gt;P: If super intelligent AI is possible, then the technological singularity is possible. (T)

&gt;P: If an alien civilization creates an AI a day before we do, we will never be able to ""catch up."" (T)

I don't think this premise is necessarily true, as there may be an upper ""limit"" to technological advancement, meaning that aliens may hit a ceiling and we _could_ ""catch up,"" but we must assume it is true. 

&gt;C: Any alien civilization that is older than human civilization will be exponentially more advanced than us, and is getting more exponentially advanced with every passing second.

So, I'd like to point out that your conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from your premise-set:

Just because an alien civilization is _older_ than human civilization does not necessarily mean it will create AI before us. There is no guarantee that, because an alien civilization existed before we did, they would end up more advanced than us. Time alone does not necessarily determine the advancement of civilization, as there are many other variables that may slow or regress a civilization - war, politics, natural disasters, etc. It may _eventually_ create AI, assuming it doesn't destroy itself, but you do not discount, in your premise-set, the fact that alien society could very well face large set-backs or simply not advance faster than humans would for whatever reason. So, this possibility, the possibility that an _older_ civilization doesn't get to the point of creating AI before us, holds true even if all premises are assumed true. 

Even if a civilization is more _advanced_ than us right _now_, there is no guarantee they won't face an issue or setback - we could face similar problems and solve them faster or differently than they would, thereby allowing us to overtake them. 

Therefore, any alien civilization older or more advanced than us would not necessarily create AI before us, and therefore, we may very well be able to compete with them. 

**Tl;DR**

It's not necessarily true an alien civilization older or more advanced than us would create AI first.

It's not necessarily true that an alien civilization, even if it created a technological singularity, would _keep_ advancing at an infinite, exponential rate, thereby giving us a chance to catch up. (this is if one of your premises is false).

"The key difference is that most men wear shirts in every professional setting.  Yes, there are casual beach or park excursions where I go topless, and I wish women could do the same.  But even then if my grandma or my boss comes up to me I wish I had a shirt.  If I went to a restaurant, gave a presentation, or went to work I would want that shirt on.  So a woman who wears a shirt isn't standing out as female. 

In contrast, most men in Iran do not wear hats on a daily basis.  In general, go to a party or walk on the street, or stand up at an office meeting, and most men will be bareheaded.  A woman who has a hijab is being marked as different.  She can't just wear typical men's clothing.

So on a scale from ideal to mandatory burkhas, mandatory shirts for women is a 1 and mandatory hats for women is a 3.  It's not horrible, but it's clearly worse than mandating something for women that men would almost always do anyway.

And then add another point or two if you actually intend to specify ""hijab"" instead of ""head covering"".

What about abortions where that's not the case? There's lots of abortions where no one but the woman even knows she's pregnant. 

I also think genuine coercion to have an abortion is very rare, at least in America. It might be common for a woman to be pressured into an abortion but rarely does this pressure rise to the level that it would rid her off responsibility if she committed a different crime.

&gt; 2

That's  a matter of political expediency not internal consistency

&gt;  It's also worth noting that making abortion illegal (i.e., punishing women for it) doesn't decrease the rate of abortions

If this were true it would be interesting but there's a lot of issues with this study. Firstly as the article notes the stats for the number of abortion on countries where it's illegal are not very reliable and may be subject to bias. Secondly, the comparison is between countries that adds a lot of extra variables. Countries where abortion is illegal often are poorer and have less education and contraception. Thirdly many of the countries where it is illegal only punish the doctors and not the women. It could be that illegalizing it at the doctor level is ineffective at reducing rates but criminalizing it for the women seeking abortions would be.


I know that even if we had harsh punishment for getting an abortion some women would still risk it but I have trouble believing it wouldn't prevent any abortions. Not every woman who gets an abortion is desperate.

Under an Austrian economy the government would have no control over banking.

The housing bubble was caused by private subprime mortgage secularization, Fannie and Freddy had much higher standards than the private MBS market.

"TL;DR: People get more value for **themselves** from donating to charities like MaW. It's not (entirely) because they identify more with cute white kids. 

You're seem to be making the presumption of a purely altruistic human. Such a human is an ideal that many strive for, but one that nobody (or at least extremely few) people reach.  Instead people donate partly because of altruistic intentions, but they also either consciously or subconsciously consider selfish ones. Greater social standing, tax write offs, and most relevant a sense of accomplishment. Every child treated by the make a wish foundation has instantaneous and complete results. The child's ""wish"" came true so 100% success. After the wish's completion there is no possibility of failure. Donate to feed the starving children? Kids fed for a finite amount of time, and is still likely to die either by starvation or some disease. The lower percentage of success induces a greater sense of failure. This means less sense of accomplishment which is a motive for donation. This means fewer donations. 

Then of course you have the fundraiser effect. People are praised and such immediately from donating to a particular charity that is visibly fundraising. This will divert funds from other charities that are objectively ""better"" in regard to the nobility of their cause. People like to be praised. Some organizations, like the Girl Scouts, fundraise in such a way as to reward their donators with actual merchandise. Raffles and so forth result in huge boosts to donations for a reason. People are selfish.

"Beyond questions of exactley how to define hate speech and where to draw the line, is whether or not an outright ban would really have any affect. 
As it stands every nation that promotes ""free"" speech still places limits on speech, and rightly so. You cannot for instance promote, or incite violence, and you cannot utter threats. Those are essentially limits on speech, and they are perfectly reasonable limits.
An outright ban on hate speech regardless of its context won't doing anything about the fact that people hold racist, xenophobic sentiments.
In my view, banning hate speech is like using incense to cover up the cat shit littering my apartment that I otherwise refuse to pick up. Policing and fining speech only sweeps the issues it's intended fix under the rug. Its not hard to cloak xenophobia in P.C. language, a good example was during Canada's last election the incumbent prime minister, Steven Harper said he wanted to protect the interests of ""old stock Canadian's"". Many Neo Nazi's now promote  ""European heritage"" rather then white power. 
 Its silly to think that enacting strict laws around hate speech where prejudice exists would do much to make that place more welcoming. Even if those laws successfully deter someone from using slurs doesn't prevent them from expressing themselves non verbally through stares, snickers, or refusal to socially engage.
Prejudice, while often linguistically expressed, is rooted in perception. The perception is what has to be adressed and limits on speech only push the issue below the surface. Furthermore it might even be counterproductive, it could serve to promote the feelings of resentment already felt by racists, homophobes, etc. Wether right or wrong (wrong in my veiw) they often feel as alienated and marginalized as the groups they activeley alienate, and marginalize. In that way it only serves to fuel their hate.

"&gt; at least theoretically we'll end up at a point where any job a person can do a machine can do better and cheaper.

This is pretty absurd. 

Unless we reach the point where a computer can literally replicate human thought processess, there are a lot of jobs that ARE impossible to automate. Automation is only useful insofar as something is able to be programed and replicated. A human can make an on the spot alteration to a process to account for a change of condition, a computer can't, unless that EXACT condition has been accounted for in the program for it. 

Then there's areas where the job is to interact with people.

People are dumber than computers are smart. 

What I mean is that no computer can POSSIBLY account for the full possible spectrum of human reaction in a given situation and form an appropriate response. Generally, this means that SOMEONE will find a completely unique way to fuck things up. But there's also whole PROFESSIONS based on this. Law can't be automated, the entire process of law is a process of discretion, where human emotions, judgment and common sense are applied to ridgid principles. A computer can't make an emotional call. If you need law, you still have police. You still have people doing problem solving and overseeing machines because if you actually work with machines, you know they don't have infinite awareness. If a stamp is automated and breaks, unless there's a sensor telling you that it broke, that machine will happily run day and night with a broken stamp. 

That's not even getting into costs. Where it becomes ""Is it cheaper to hire a person who can do SEVERAL small jobs or build a machine for each and every one of them."" A human roofer can measure everything, strip off the old shingles, fix the stuff underneath because those boards look like they've seen better days, they can lift the new shingles, line them up, nail them down and if there's some odd quirk to the design, they can cut the shingle on site and have it fit.

By limiting the amount of exposure something has, it starts to create power. Consider the knee, for instance. The knee was long held a provocative and sexual part of the body and women had to cover that for a long time. And it was not until the 20's (?) that dresses started to rise above the knee, which probably was considered slutty for its time. Maybe they were asking for it, if they revealed their knees. I am not saying we cannot acclimate to the culture of allowing breasts to be shown, however, I think the more we keep it hidden, the more we will sexualize it.

In a sense one could say that the law is indeed bad; it should contain such provision, but from practical standpoint it cannot (it would lead to cheating).

&gt; One of the most important is that the law is procedurally legitimate, i.e. passed in accordance with the standards governing how laws are passed in our society

Except you said it is for you. The whole ""cannot be not attached to a person"" thingy just few sentences above?

&gt; If guys have the power to just walk away and don't have to make any effort to avoid offending me (which you stated when saying they don't have to make any effort to avoid objectifying me)

First, not objectifying is like telling a person he is prohibited to see colors. You can't do it, it's the way our brain works. 

Second, objectifying is mammal thing, not men thing. All humans do that.

Third, you just objectified men in that sentence. 

Fourth. You are complaining how man are not being as emotionally attached as you, while suggesting you could do prostitution instead of dating. Which has no emotional attachment.

&gt;then by treating every interaction with men as a business transaction, I would have the same power.

No idea what that means. You somehow loose power if you love someone and care for them. But you have the same power if you sell your bodies for one time use?

&gt;That's why I said generally and outlined that word. I knew that those arguments of ""not all guys are the same"" would come up. 

The opposite actually. The people you are describing are satirical stereotypes. Very little of men fit that criterium. It's like saying. : ""I'm sure not all Jews have curly hair and big noses""... Majority of them don't have those characteristics.

&gt; In my experience, I never had any guy willing to commit to me.

From what I hear, you are unwilling to commit yourself. Committing is two way street. You want all the benefits, but you are unwilling to put any effort into that.

&gt;According to the feminist view you are even expected to pay half of the bills, so there's not even the advantage of being taken out on dates.

Please don't say ""according to feminist"". You instantly loose most of your credibility. Feminist's believe there are several hundreds of genders for God sake. As to the question. Everybody is different. Most men will offer to pay for you. But then again, a lot of women see's it like insult thanks to the new age feminism. It's no win scenario for the men.

&gt;If you don't do it, you are considered needy and a broken asset. 

And if you do it, you are considered gold-digging leach. See? again, you can cherry pick any attribute of dating, choose any outcome and you will find something negative about it. The trick is, not expecting everybody is an asshole.

&gt;You are expected to be able to take care of yourself and be emotionally independent.

Isn't fun to be a man, is it?

&gt;You are supposed to leave when you are told to, otherwise you are needy; you are not supposed to expect a free ride because that shows a character flaw. So if I don't get anything in return then what's in there for me? If I am self reliable or working to be, what's the advantage of having a guy around? He won't contribute with anything for me to achieve my final goal.

You have broken view of relationships. You see it as competition and you worry about what will society think of you if you behave this way and that. When in reality nobody really gives a shit. Do what you want, behave like you would. Be yourself, and guess what, somebody there will find it attractive, and somebody else won't. There is no magic solution, no magic avoid button for all problems and unpleasantness. Maybe you will be emotionally hurt, but then again maybe you won't and you find your life partner.

&gt;If I am self reliable or working to be, what's the advantage of having a guy around?

Try looking at it from the other perspective. What can you offer to the guy? Try to honestly answer that. What you can offer? Support, stability, emotional attachemnt, physical comfort? If you can answer that, then that is your answer. Because yet again, relationship is two way street.
