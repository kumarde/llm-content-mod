Your submission has been removed because the description text for your photos needs a bit more detail.

**Please read this entire message before you reply, and before you contact the Moderators about your post.**

Photo descriptions must detail important aspects of your project, including:

- the *materials* you used, including fasteners and finishing materials

-  the *tools* you used for the various steps, including power and hand tools, and

- *construction methods* - what did you do to get from one picture to the next? How did you fasten? How did you cut? How did you prep? How did you paint? Why did you do it that way?

The rule is that when submitting a post, assume that the reader is not familiar with the subject matter, and **approach it as if you are teaching a classroom how to replicate your project**. Remember that people who read your post may not have the same knowledge and background that you do, so don't assume that readers will understand what you did. What may be obvious to you may not be obvious to the reader.

Please feel free to edit descriptions to your photos, and [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDIY&subject=Photo%20descriptions) when you have done so. We will review your edits and restore your post if the descriptions look good. We will try our best to work with you to get your post restored.

Your question has been removed because it's not specific enough.

**Please read this entire message before you reply, and before you contact the Moderators about your post.**

We **LOVE** questions - we really do! - but help request posts are only appropriate if you have a *specific* question about an *aspect* of a DIY project. Questions should include a description of the project you want to do, and details of what you need help with. Include photos if you can.

This subreddit is about HOW to do things. If your question can't be reduced to a sentence that starts with the word ""How"", then it probably doesn't belong here.

The following types of questions aren't allowed here - if your post contains any of the following, that's probably why it was removed:

1. asking for aesthetic judgments (i.e., what color to paint something, whether something would look ""good"")

2. asking *whether* you should do a project

3. asking ""Has anyone built anything like X?""

4. asking how to ""get started"" on a project

5. asking if a project is ""easy""

6. asking which way to approach a project would be best

7. asking ""What should I make?""

8. asking ""What's the best way to make X?""

9. asking ""Does anyone have any ideas for?""

10. asking ""Where can I buy a _____?""

11. asking ""What is this thing called?""

12. asking ""How do I get started with _______?""

13. asking ""Does anyone have any links?""

14. asking ""Has anyone ever used/made X?""

You have a few options:

1. If you have a project in mind, do some research, put together a basic plan for your project, and re-post a specific question about your project. Your question should describe what you want to accomplish, what you have researched, and a specific question about HOW to accomplish it. If you can re-word your question so that it starts with the word ""how"", it's probably OK here.

2.  **If appropriate, please repost your question in the stickied [Simple Questions](/r/DIY/about/sticky) thread at the top of /r/DIY.** It's a weekly thread intended for more general questions. It's usually very active, and you will probably get some answers.

3. Post your question in another subreddit, such as /r/HomeImprovement, /r/woodworking, /r/whatisthisthing, etc.

We encourage you to read the [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines) for more information.

The Moderators are human, just like you, and sometimes we make mistakes. If you believe that the removal or your post is a mistake, please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDIY&subject=Specific%20questions). Thank you.",DIY,1

"Full waterproofing is a relatively new concept in shower design and building.  For years people have been doing it just the way you did with duroc, thinset, and tile without issue.  If you had said greenboard and mastic then that could have been another discussion.

Gypsum wallboard soaks up water and holds it, expanding and making a breeding ground for mold and making your mortar bed unstable.  Thinset and duroc are permeable and wick water.  So although your concrete board may get wet from time to time, it should wick the water and dry without any major concern.  It's definitely a good idea to run your bath exhaust fan during and for 10-15 minutes after your showers to eliminate residual steam and make the least humid environment in your bathroom possible.

Don't feel bad, I had the same semi-panic attack at the same time when I was finishing my first bathroom, but after a lot of digging this is the conclusion that seemed to keep popping up.

When submitting a post, assume that the reader is not familiar with the subject matter, and approach it **as if you are teaching a classroom how to replicate your project**.

Your submission has been removed because the description text for your photos needs a bit more detail.

**Please read this entire message before you reply, and before you contact the Moderators about your post.**

Photo descriptions must detail important aspects of your project, including:

- the *materials* you used, including fasteners and finishing materials

-  the *tools* you used for the various steps, including power and hand tools, and

- *construction methods* - what did you do to get from one picture to the next? How did you fasten? How did you cut? How did you prep? How did you paint? Why did you do it that way?

The rule is that when submitting a post, assume that the reader is not familiar with the subject matter, and **approach it as if you are teaching a classroom how to replicate your project**. Remember that people who read your post may not have the same knowledge and background that you do, so don't assume that readers will understand what you did. What may be obvious to you may not be obvious to the reader.

Please feel free to edit descriptions to your photos, and [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDIY&subject=Photo%20descriptions) when you have done so.

Your question has been removed because it's not specific enough.

**Please read this entire message before you reply, and before you contact the Moderators about your post.**

We **LOVE** questions - we really do! - but help request posts are only appropriate if you have a *specific* question about an *aspect* of a DIY project. Questions should include a description of the project you want to do, and details of what you need help with. Include photos if you can.

This subreddit is about HOW to do things. If your question can't be reduced to a sentence that starts with the word ""How"", then it probably doesn't belong here.

The following types of questions aren't allowed here - if your post contains any of the following, that's probably why it was removed:

1. asking for aesthetic judgments (i.e., what color to paint something, whether something would look ""good"")

2. asking *whether* you should do a project

3. asking ""Has anyone built anything like X?""

4. asking how to ""get started"" on a project

5. asking if a project is ""easy""

6. asking which way to approach a project would be best

7. asking ""What should I make?""

8. asking ""What's the best way to make X?""

9. asking ""Does anyone have any ideas for?""

10. asking ""Where can I buy a _____?""

11. asking ""What is this thing called?""

12. asking ""How do I get started with _______?""

13. asking ""Does anyone have any links?""

14. asking ""Has anyone ever used/made X?""

You have a few options:

1. If you have a project in mind, do some research, put together a basic plan for your project, and re-post a specific question about your project. Your question should describe what you want to accomplish, what you have researched, and a specific question about HOW to accomplish it. If you can re-word your question so that it starts with the word ""how"", it's probably OK here.

2.  **If appropriate, please repost your question in the stickied [Simple Questions](/r/DIY/about/sticky) thread at the top of /r/DIY.** It's a weekly thread intended for more general questions. It's usually very active, and you will probably get some answers.

3. Post your question in another subreddit, such as /r/HomeImprovement, /r/woodworking, /r/whatisthisthing, etc.

We LOVE questions in /r/DIY. We really do! BUT please do some research before bringing your question to /r/DIY.

**Please read this entire message before you reply, and before you contact the Moderators about your post**

We **LOVE** questions! However, we should not be your first stop when you run into a problem or have a question. Your post has been removed because a Moderator thinks you should be able to find your answer pretty easily by Googling, or searching around in this subreddit.

You have a couple of options:

- Search this subreddit using the Search box in the sidebar to see if someone has already solved your problem before, or to see if another post here sheds some light on your question.

- Use Google to do general background research on your topic. If those searches don't turn up an answer to your specific question, please include the details of your research when you ask your question here so that we don't cover the same ground again. Provide as much detail as possible.

- If you have a question about a product, device, or material, please try contacting the manufacturer, reading the manual or instructions, or browsing their website, and try to find the answer there before posting your question. If you have already done this, you need to specify this in your post.

- If you've already done research, please re-submit your question and describe what you have learned from that research, and your resulting **specific** question(s).

**Additionally, consider the stickied [Simple Questions](/r/DIY/about/sticky) thread at the top of /r/DIY for your question, if applicable.**

Enthusiasm is great, but the respect also needs to be there. Lets say I was visiting your house and you had an authentic Navajo rug that you bought from an actual Navajo weaver and you know about the history behind the rugs. Lets say I think this rug is pretty awesome and want something like that for my house, so I head over to Overstock.com and buy [this](https://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/5x8-6x9-Rugs/607/subcat.html?featuredproduct=9989241&amp;featuredoption=15067805&amp;cid=202290&amp;kid=9553000357392&amp;track=pspla&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=17139726-000-000&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjwydK_BRDK34GenvLB61YSJACZ8da3VPr_XGrB4dHEJLkTeNEaYEjwCMKRBxxQ4J_l0Avm9BoCvEfw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) thing from China for cheap. Now I've got a sweet rug in my living room too! Awesome right?! Not really, I've engaged in appropriation by not really respecting the cultural origins of the Navajo style as well as denying that culture credit in the form of not buying from an authentic source.

Think of something about your culture that is specific to that culture. Now imagine you start seeing that thing popping up all over the place in the media and in the real world. You know damned well these people don't have a clue what this thing means to your culture, they're just doing it because it looks cool. How does that make you feel? If it were me I'd find it very irritating at the least, and I don't even come from a marginalized race and culture. When you do come from a marginalized place it's even worse, another thing to add to the pile of BS you've already got to deal with.

We LOVE questions in /r/DIY. We really do! BUT please do some research before bringing your question to /r/DIY.

**Please read this entire message before you reply, and before you contact the Moderators about your post**

We **LOVE** questions! However, we should not be your first stop when you run into a problem or have a question. Your post has been removed because a Moderator thinks you should be able to find your answer pretty easily by Googling, or searching around in this subreddit.

You have a couple of options:

- Search this subreddit using the Search box in the sidebar to see if someone has already solved your problem before, or to see if another post here sheds some light on your question.

- Use Google to do general background research on your topic. If those searches don't turn up an answer to your specific question, please include the details of your research when you ask your question here so that we don't cover the same ground again. Provide as much detail as possible.

- If you have a question about a product, device, or material, please try contacting the manufacturer, reading the manual or instructions, or browsing their website, and try to find the answer there before posting your question. If you have already done this, you need to specify this in your post.

- If you've already done research, please re-submit your question and describe what you have learned from that research, and your resulting **specific** question(s).

**Additionally, consider the stickied [Simple Questions](/r/DIY/about/sticky) thread at the top of /r/DIY for your question, if applicable.**

- asking for recommendations about a tool or a material (unless it relates to a specific aspect of a project you are doing and which you describe in your post).

- Fundraising or survey posts.

- A ""DIY tips"" or product recommendations.

- Any other post that is not a ""project post"" or does not contain a specific question about a DIY project.

You have a couple of options:

1. Try another subreddit instead, such as /r/homeimprovement or /r/fixit.

"The decision to remodel your home is probably the second-most important decision you’ll make as a homeowner after the decision to purchase a home in the first place. A remodel is an important investment and if you don’t make decisions regarding it carefully, you can end up not getting much out of that investment. Here are six things you need to do before you remodel.

Think about style

Homes come in a wide variety of styles. If your home has a purity of style—if it pretty much has all the architectural details of a given style, then it’s pretty easy to tell what style your home is. There’s colonials, Victorians, mid-century ranches, and Cape Cod cottages to name just a few. Many modern homes mix architectural features from different styles and are harder to define. Some terms you’ll often hear are traditional, transitional, or contemporary. It’s important to figure out your home’s dominant style before you begin a remodel. Look at your home from a distance, perhaps from across the street, and look at its shape and size as well as the pitch of the roof and the placement of the windows. Now you’re ready to decide if you want to work with the existing style of your home or change it all together.

Think about functionality

Your remodeled home doesn’t just need to look beautiful, it needs to meet the needs of everyone living in it. Evaluate your family’s current and future needs. In what ways is your home meeting those needs? In what ways does it fall short? For some homeowners, it’s easy to tell exactly when their home needs. Others know it’s lacking something but they don’t know what. Before you start remodeling, you need to get a good sense of how your home needs to change to make it more functional.

Have a very detailed plan

Most remodeling horror stories originate from a lack of planning. If you want your remodel to go smoothly, you need to have a master plan for the entire project that specifies everything down to the tiniest detail so that nothing is left to chance. Your vision for your home should be drawn up to scale so that remodelers can’t possibly go wrong if they just follow the plans.

Set a budget

You should also have a set budget to go along with that master plan. The contractor should provide a detailed list of all the materials needed and an estimated timeline for the project. From this information, you should be able to create a fairly accurate budget. The estimated cost needs to be reasonable so don’t estimate for the best case scenario. In fact, you should assume the worst and then add another 15% more than you think it’s going to cost just to be safe. You don’t want to run out of funds mid-project. If your plans don’t fit within your budget, change your plans, don’t go in just thinking everything will magically work out.

Think smarter, not bigger

When your family has outgrown the home, you may be tempted to build an addition onto your home. This is the nuclear option for home remodeling and it tends to be a poor investment. Instead of thinking bigger, think how the existing square footage can be used most effectively so you’re getting as much as possible out of the space you have rather than spending a fortune for a little more space.

Carefully select a contractor

The success or failure of any remodel largely falls on the quality of the general contractor. Don’t just hire the first one you come across and don’t automatically go with the lowest bid. Get several estimates and do your homework looking into each one. You need a contractor with many years of experience and a proven reputation in the area. You can check with local home improvement stores for good references and check with the Better Business Bureau as well.

"Having city water and well water connected to the same system is illegal. It's called a ""cross connection"". The water the city delivers to your' home has been treated to make it safe to drink. Your' well, while interesting, is a shallow well that is easily contaminated. You are putting your health, and your neighbors health at risk. I know you said there is a check valve of some sort at the city's meter, but that doesn't make your' well any less dangerous. Even things like water spigots are equipped with built in anti-siphon features nowadays. Let's say some guy up the street is mixing up a batch of weed killer in a pump sprayer. He pours in the poison, and drops the hose in to let it fill. Now let's say there is a water leak in the city's main, or the fire department opens a hydrant. The loss of water pressure in the main line, creates a backflow that siphons the poison right out of the jug, through his plumbing, and into the city's water system. Now everyone on your' street is drinking RoundUp weed killer. It's dangerous to have cross connections. That's just talking about back-siphonage. What you have is a 1/2 hp motor PUMPING dirty water back into the city water under pressure. There is a reason shit like this is illegal. Just looking at that terrible job you did with the pvc primer makes me cringe. It's clear you don't know what you are doing. I think it's a cool diy project, but please for gods sake unhook that shit from the city water supply. Putting yourself in danger is one thing.

"The point here is that

1. White people have been subjugating people of colour for generations, be they black, First Nations, Chinese, etc., making for a history of violence and hostility against those people; and
2. White people frequently take symbolism that has a specific cultural or religious meaning and use it in a way that blatantly ignores or even subverts that meaning, being hugely culturally insensitive

For example, what's wrong with e.g. someone from Japan wearing a cross necklace because they think it's a nice design? Well, not much. But would people be offended if someone shot hardcore pornography in a church and pissed on a carving of Jesus? Yeah, they would, because that symbolism means something to people, even if it doesn't to the filmmakers. That's what a lot of white people do to their cultures, because they don't understand or care that those things have real meaning to people.

The difference is that for white Christians, typically they've had all the power so there isn't a history of overt and subtle violence and racism against them.

In the end, it's not about using elements from someone else's culture, it's about *misusing* elements with specific meaning and purpose out of context, either through a lack of understanding or, often, through deliberate and willful disrespect.",DIY,0

Your question has been removed because it's not specific enough.

**Please read this entire message before you reply, and before you contact the Moderators about your post.**

We **LOVE** questions - we really do! - but help request posts are only appropriate if you have a *specific* question about an *aspect* of a DIY project. Questions should include a description of the project you want to do, and details of what you need help with. Include photos if you can.

This subreddit is about HOW to do things. If your question can't be reduced to a sentence that starts with the word ""How"", then it probably doesn't belong here.

The following types of questions aren't allowed here - if your post contains any of the following, that's probably why it was removed:

1. asking for aesthetic judgments (i.e., what color to paint something, whether something would look ""good"")

2. asking *whether* you should do a project

3. asking ""Has anyone built anything like X?""

4. asking how to ""get started"" on a project

5. asking if a project is ""easy""

6. asking which way to approach a project would be best

7. asking ""What should I make?""

8. asking ""What's the best way to make X?""

9. asking ""Does anyone have any ideas for?""

10. asking ""Where can I buy a _____?""

11. asking ""What is this thing called?""

12. asking ""How do I get started with _______?""

13. asking ""Does anyone have any links?""

14. asking ""Has anyone ever used/made X?""

You have a few options:

1. If you have a project in mind, do some research, put together a basic plan for your project, and re-post a specific question about your project. Your question should describe what you want to accomplish, what you have researched, and a specific question about HOW to accomplish it. If you can re-word your question so that it starts with the word ""how"", it's probably OK here.

2.  **If appropriate, please repost your question in the stickied [Simple Questions](/r/DIY/about/sticky) thread at the top of /r/DIY.** It's a weekly thread intended for more general questions. It's usually very active, and you will probably get some answers.

3. Post your question in another subreddit, such as /r/HomeImprovement, /r/woodworking, /r/whatisthisthing, etc.

"Interesting problem you've got there.  A couple of questions, please.

Question 1. Have you looking into getting a permit for this job?  You are messing with foundation, as well as structure.  

While one the face of it doesn't look technically difficult, there may be some challenges:

Second question.  Where do you live?
  
Local building codes will specify  the minimum depth and width of your trenches but in general the trenches should be at least 12” - 18” wide and minimum 18” deep. In areas where the ground freezes, the code may require footings at least 48” below ground level to get below the 'frost line' and prevent the concrete from shifting.  Do you live in a place like that?

The width and depth of the footings will also be impacted by the dead load (the building, and everything attached to it), and the live load (stuff hanging off the walls and ceilings, the snow on the roof, etc.

Question 3.  How big is it, and is it light, medium, or heavy weight construction?  That will determine how wide and how deep the footings are, as well as the reinforcing of it. Soil conditions matter, as well.  Some parts of the country have expansive soils, which require deeper footings.

For the anchor bolts the 2009 IRC handbook says this:

*(403.1.6) says that anchor bolts can be no more than 6'-0"" O.C. There must be a minimum of 2 bolts per plate section and they must be within 12"" of the end of the wall.* 

Areas with high wind loads can be spec'd out at 30"" O.C. for regular house construction and some of the cities are requiring a 2"" square washer.

So Question 4.  How windy is it there?


I am not trying to be a jerk, but there is more to foundation work than you are aware of.  I suggest you get at least three bids from foundation companies, and ask them to submit the job requirements in writing, so that you can compare all bidders.  This will provide you a wealth of information on just what will go into this project.",DIY,0

**Please read this entire message before you reply, and before you contact the Moderators about your post.**

We **LOVE** questions - we really do! - but help request posts are only appropriate if you have a *specific* question about an *aspect* of a DIY project. Questions should include a description of the project you want to do, and details of what you need help with. Include photos if you can.

This subreddit is about HOW to do things. If your question can't be reduced to a sentence that starts with the word ""How"", then it probably doesn't belong here.

The following types of questions aren't allowed here - if your post contains any of the following, that's probably why it was removed:

You have a few options:

1. If you have a project in mind, do some research, put together a basic plan for your project, and re-post a specific question about your project. Your question should describe what you want to accomplish, what you have researched, and a specific question about HOW to accomplish it. If you can re-word your question so that it starts with the word ""how"", it's probably OK here.

2.  **If appropriate, please repost your question in the stickied [Simple Questions](/r/DIY/about/sticky) thread at the top of /r/DIY.** It's a weekly thread intended for more general questions. It's usually very active, and you will probably get some answers.

3. Post your question in another subreddit, such as /r/HomeImprovement, /r/woodworking, /r/whatisthisthing, etc.

"Upcycling comes from energy sustainability and means you use a product that has reached the end of its life to replace another product effectively eliminating the waste of energy to make a new product AND extending the life of the old product. A typical example is making garden wall out of old tires and dirt. The tire is done and has to be thrown away for its use on cars, but it works as well if not better than concrete walls when filled with dirt. This saves from the environmental and energy costs of creating and using concrete and saves a tire from contributing to a garbage pile.

So long story short, your little hobby piece is not upcycling., especially with how much work (power tools use a lot of... energy, duh) and new materials you put into the new product.",DIY,0
