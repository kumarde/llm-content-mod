"Several things wrong with your argument. One you repeated what I said several times. Second transgenderism is a mental illness, studies have shown that suicide rates pre treatment(which are higher than that of any people group in history the only comparable suicide rate to trans people is jews who lived in nazi Germany) which are past 40% stay the same or even some have found gets higher post treatment. If it wasn't a mental illness they would lower as they're finally getting what they want also not to mention the first hospital and first doctor to preform a sex change surgery will no longer do so as they see it as a mental illness and will not ruin these people's lives longer. I'm sorry but I do not buy into this special snowflake business that liberals came up with and trans people came up with for attention. Third you have yet to state how this is not a legitimate law in fact you have yet to say how this does not stops sex offenders. You also fail to realize that taking away someone's human right to go to the bathroom when they want isn't okay. Liberals and progressives think that they are doing good by taking away people's rights to pander to a select group when they're just in reality creating inequality and taking away the rights of a group of people which is wrong. You see the same thing with the feminist movement that only makes gender issues worse. Black Lives matters that has created the ideology in leftists that you can't be racist to white people.

Are you seriously asking for evidence of women being oppressed in Iran?

"Austin, I'm glad you're an atheist and proud of your beliefs, but here's a few words of advice (which are probably going to get downvoted in this circle jerk of a support thread).

The easiest thing to do today is take a posturing, ""I'm right, you're wrong, you can't tell me what to do"" position, especially on religion, and show it off to people on the internet.  Way too many Christians do this, and it's obnoxious. 

However, with this meme and your conversation, you're doing exactly the same thing.  This meme suggests that religious denominations are full of violent extremists, which isn't at all true. The vast majority of religious people - we're talking billions of people - are just living their lives.  It's only for a relatively small proportion of people that religion is the most important thing in their life - which is also true for a small portion of atheists on Reddit.

For most people, religion is a practice they grew up with and aren't interested in changing - they grew up in a club, and just figure they'll stick with that club as part of their life.  Nobody wants to hear a bunch of ""The old testament says you must not work on the sabbath BS"" because very few Christians have (1) read the bible or (2) believe that stuff.  For a Christian, listening to you mock Christianity in trying to spread your atheist beliefs is the as what it feels like, as an atheist, listening to Westboro church people spread their Christian beliefs.  You come off sounding like a total idiot.

If you want to promote atheism and change minds, you don't have to respect the religious belief, but you do have to respect the person, and suggesting to anyone that they're affiliated with extremists is the wrong place to start. You need to stop talking and start listening - try to understand what and why people believe before even beginning to talk about your own beliefs.  And most people will not even want to have this conversation with you - for the same reason that I don't want to talk to Jehova's Witnesses who stop by my house. 

Finally, and this is the most important thing - that is one of the worst memes I've ever seen - it barely makes sense - and you need to just stop complaining about how you got made fun of over that, because you deserved it. 

TLDR: Quit acting like a militant atheist with BS memes

"The issue with that question is that it insincerely rests in the premise that his supporters are white supremacists - a characterization that is not rooted in fact, since his appeal spans across ethnicities and even countries. Our communities have citizens from all over the world, of all faiths and backgrounds participating in them. In fact, a large chunk of the Trump subreddit on this website consists of former Sanders supporters. 

The dislike of Mark Zuckerberg is rooted in the fact that Facebook had been intensely partisan throughout the campaign. Facebook has also used their algorithm to deprioritize several conservative leaning websites, many of which are sometimes marked as fake news. Facebook also entrusted the partisan Snopes.Com which is a website run by a couple who have openly supported secretary Clinton, to be a source of what constitutes truth vs hoaxes. Ironically this very couple is in the middle of a divorce involving infidelity and embezzlement - certainly not paragons of truth and justice. 

To reduce our views to identity politics is very disingenuous and essentially reflects an abject ignorance for the support base's general philosophy, a central prong of which is a complete rejection of identity politics in its entirety. 

I can't speak for anyone else, but in my own personal worldview, as someone who is consistently profiled by the TSA for my appearance, I am entirely against the idea that the concept of racial identity is to be handled with kid gloves just because humans did some shitty racist stuff in our history, we now have to treat people of ""oppressed"" races with some kind of special sensitivity. It makes perfect sense why I'd be profiled, I look like I come from a part of the world where Islam is the predominant religion, which is for the most part a horribly violent and hateful ideology. There's a higher probability of someone who looks like me being a greater security risk than others, and so if I have to be inconvenienced by a little extra searching, so be it.

People who frame issues like this in the form of identity politics and cry racism at reasonable assertions, are part of the problem that Trump's typical support base wants to solve. This sort of argument does nothing in any discussion and only seeks to silence points of view through allegations of white supremacy, which are clearly utter nonsense since they are being levelled at non-whites like myself.

"The main argument against it is from the ten commandments; ""thou shall not kill"". However there's some disagreement depending on the denomination on when the fetus is considered alive enough to kill. In catholicism when the rule can't be found explicitly in the bible, it's considered the church's job to be the scholars who fill in the gaps. In 2010 Pope Benedict XVI filled that gap by his decree ""from the moment of its conception life must be guarded with the greatest care...."", implying that the fetus has enough of a soul at conception to be killed.

Because they are deviants? Abnormal? Once again, what does this have to do with ATHEISM. That's the point. The fact that you don't talk about atheism but trying to push a pro-gay agenda just proves my point. WHO GIVES A SHIT either way on an atheism subreddit? What does that have to do with ATHEISM? 


> you also seem to have some very strange ideas about how people here view eastern religions.

People here LOVE to push the ""mystical east"" bullshit. Not to mention the ""native american"" bullshit. The ""mystical east"" despised and still despises gay people. So have the native americans. But lets blame it all on ""abrahamic religions"". 

Religion didn't invent homophobia. Homophobia existed before religion. Religion just borrowed it from society/humans. Okay?

White men built this. They died for it. Worked for it. Believed in it. Lived lives of discipline to built it. And people who want to throw it all away, everything that made their privileged life possible in exchange for nihilism and the ruling class of global elite who would see it all burn for their own globabl domination and self interests, are the very people who were once again saved by the election on DJT by white men.

"Well lets see here, Physcists like Krauss and Hawking redefine nothing. Quantum mechanics isn’t nothing. The potential for physical stuff to come from scratch isn’t nothing. Its potential. They say nothing is unstable. That is a property and a property is not nothing. 

Dawkins is a hypocrite for asking if god made us then who made god? He never asks for any further explanation of the laws of physics and then asks the theist for a further expnation of god. You don’t need to reduce the laws of physics down to any further explkanations if you want to do science. If you want to talk about the existance of god, you need more than science. 

Many of them are positivists meaning they believe science is the only source of knowledge which is circular reasoning plain and simple because how can science test the validity of its own method? Science can’t prove science, it assumes logic and math beforehand.

Many of them make the fallacy of saying god is bad. Well they can’t say that without a foundation for objective moral judgements. Objective morals don’t hinge on one’s belief in god but they do hinge on the existance of some form of transcending foundation. God is the only candidate in town when it comes to objective morals. So saying god is bad is nothing more than demagoguery. 

Dennet, Carrol, and Shermer have thrown out the mind-body problem and said that the mind is the brain. This is factually incorrect and it renders them objectively ignorant and in my opinion laughable.

The correct counterargument is to go the benevolent route and ask if a being of perfect and absolute evil can exist.  Most Christians and several other theists would agree and say that such an entity would be called the Devil, Satan, or what have you.  Well, if that entity truly possesses the infinite perfect abilities of a God, which would be necessary to be perfectly evil, then such an entity would be God itself according the original logic.

"I have posted this before, but I think it puts these kinds of arguments in perspective.

God is often compared to a parent (""Our father who art in heaven..."") looking after us, His children. Let us consider what a father would do for a child. Depending upon the child's age, the father will allow the child a degree of freedom of choice. Possibly the child can choose what toy to play with, or what TV program to watch, or whether to have a glass or orange juice or a glass of grape juice, or what color crayon to use when drawing a picture, and so forth. These are very minor choices, but generally, as a child grows up, the scope of available choices increases. 

However if the parent sees that the child is doing something that is dangerous, such as running out into traffic to chase a ball, or drinking bleach, or setting fire to a table cloth, and so forth, the parent will not hesitate to step in and stop the child from doing that. The parent would be very negligent to fail to do so. This parental intervention infringes upon the freedom of choice of the child, but the parent has the right and the obligation to infringe upon freedom of choice in the interest of the child's survival and well being.

But what if some little child runs out into traffic to chase a ball when the parent is not looking? God is (supposedly) always looking. God, who is supposedly omnipotent, could also stop the child from running out into traffic, and as humanity's parent God would have the same reason to do so as the child's biological parent. But God does not do that. God knows of no limit to free will. There is literally nothing that would be too tragic for God to allow.

The belief that an atrocity such as the Holocaust, or even the smaller scale atrocity of the recent Orlando shooting or the 9/11 terrorism, would be allowed by God on the grounds that the Nazis or the terrorists must be allowed to exercise their free will and are therefore free to murder whomever they wish to murder, is not reasonable. If you or I had the power to stop those things we would not hesitate to do so, and we would have no regret about interfering with the free will of murderers. Their free will is just not that important. Free will only goes so far. But not for God, who allows any and all atrocities.

Whose free will did God respect by not eliminating tuberculosis, malaria, HIV, zika, and various other very harmful plagues? We would have to argue that it must have been the will of Satan for these diseases to exist, since no person created them, so apparently God respects Satan's free will as well. If so, I would again ask if that is reasonable. Why is Satan's free will more important than the vast numbers of people who have been harmed? If one being has the means and the desire to murder billions of people, should he be allowed to do so? It seems like the wrong priority to choose.

Any human being who had the power to prevent terrible misfortunes but chooses not to do so would be regarded as a bad person, perhaps a horrible, monstrous person. Yet when God does the same thing, He is acclaimed for His perfect love and compassion, right? Thank you for letting me die in agony, God, You are so great and wonderful, you have allowed me my free will. That's what you say when dying of cancer, right? Even though you did not exactly choose to die of cancer, but maybe you chose to smoke cigarettes or something like that. Who would not prefer for God to cure them? And perhaps God could have done something to prevent people from smoking cigarettes in the first place. Maybe He should not have created tobacco plants.

God not only allows evil, He casts temptation in our path. If the bible is to be believed, the first sin committed by the human race, eating the forbidden fruit, was only possible because God chose to place a forbidden tree in the Garden of Eden where Adam and Eve had free access to it. Even then, God wanted us to have a convenient opportunity to make wrong choices, for which we were then to be severely punished. Imagine now a parent who sets out a bowl of fruit. It includes an apple which has been poisoned, but which still looks delicious. The parent then tells his children, here's some fruit, eat anything you like except for the apple. Don't eat that. The the parent simply watches what the children do and does not interfere if they do decide to eat the apple anyway. If the children then die in agony, it is all to the good; at least they exercised their free will.",atheism,0

"The way I see it, it's meant, that the same process is used, that was used by Jefferson for his ""Jefferson Bible"" - remove everything, where a supernatural claim is the subject, in order to be left with a moral philosophy, that then can be judged as more or less rational, plausible or consistent. 

From what I can gather, the ""Jefferson Bible"" was only a nickname for what Jefferson himself named ""The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth"". 

I can't tell, if the Koran, stripped from every supernatural claim, was ""The Life and Morals of Muhammad of Mekka"", but the idea is to find the moral philosophy, that's taught. 

Of course, I'm not an expert, when it comes to the Koran, but from what I can gather, it doesn't tell us that much about Muhammad's life, and it's more a book of rules, less a book of allegories, parables and analogies, than its Christian counterpart.

As for homossexuality, besides the occasional comments from the pastor warning us about ""laws being passed that will force the church to do gay weddings"", I can only recall two events.

I was 13 or 14, and was shocked to see a gay person in the flesh for the first time, but he never showed up again. The other one was the brother of a church's member's, who said in the pulpit that God had rid him of homossexuality. This happened in my final years in the church, where most of my deconversion had already taken place; I was completely outraged by what he said, specially since the whole church displayed agreement with him as he was speaking.

Your second point seems theoretically true, but I am still surprised at the lack of ""hard data"" on the topic (again, hence why I am trying to research it). 

In regards to your 5th bullet, do you know of any solid metrics that illustrate that? I dont mean that to sound argumentative, I mean it out of curiosity. While I know several popular writers/philosophers address their atheist beliefs back then, I dont think (for what it's worth) it was anywhere near the realm of popular opinion for the day (to be contrasted with the major proponents of atheism we see today, as well as the growing % of the population that identifies as atheist). That's just my thought, I have little to back that up, but am super interested to see what the facts/numbers are! 

Also, thanks for those last two points. Are you sure a/Atheism is never capitalized? Also curious where you learned this from. In beginning to research the topic of atheism, I have found a LOT of information but often little consensus on how to approach it. Maybe atheist is uncapitalized and specific types of atheism (like Anti-Theist) are capitalized? Definitely need to know this for when I get to writing a manuscript!

Additionally, while your last bullet makes sense, can it also be a belief too? especially when you get into variants like Anti-Theism and Gnostic Atheists who are certain there is no god, wouldn't that qualify as a belief? It isnt just the lack of belief in a god, but rather they are certain that there is not a god. Oh boy, now I am confusing myself, hah.

"This point has been made by the great atheist writer and neurologist, Sam Harris. We know that whenever the human brain is damaged, either by disease, ageing, injury, or surgery, some mental function is lost. Furthermore, specific mental functions are associated with specific parts of the brain. Emotions are produced in the limbic system, higher cognitive functions occur in the neo-cortex, there is a speech center, a hearing center, and so forth. The more damage there is to the brain, the more mental functions are lost. When the brain dies, and therefore every part of the brain ceases to function, we would logically expect that all mental function would cease.

What if the human mind resided in the soul, rather than the brain? This idea raises a number of very serious questions. Why would injury to the brain reduce mental functioning if the mind is not produced by the brain, but resides in an indestructible, spiritual entity called the soul? If your entire mind remains intact even when the brain is dead, then why would you ever suffer from loss of mental functioning? Equally well, we would have to ask what function the brain actually has, if it is not the source of the human mind. The brain seems to be an important part of the body, very heavily protected by the skull (it has more protection than any other organ) and it consumes a lot of the body's available nutrients, so in evolutionary terms, it must be doing something.

Aside from those issues, it is also true that there has never been a scientific observation of any kind of spiritual energy, or soul, or life force, whatever you want to call it. If souls are of such importance, and are the true source of the human mind, personality, and identity, then they must have some observable phenomena associated with them. Where do they come from, how are they generated, how do they interface with the human body, can they be converted into any other form of energy, what can they affect other than the human body, and so forth. Souls defy all efforts at observation, and this speaks very ill of the likelihood that they exist. Real things can be scientifically observed. Imaginary things can't be scientifically observed.

Aside from the issue of damage to the brain, there are other ways to connect the brain to mental functioning. You can electrically stimulate the brain and produce mental effects. You can observe the brain with a magnetic resonance imaging device (MRI) and see direct correlations between thoughts and brain activity. No neurologist would doubt for a moment that thought originates in the brain. And if it originates in the brain, then it does not originate in the soul.

Without a soul, there can be no afterlife. When the human organism dies, and its brain dies with it, no mystical spirit survives that death. The person is simply gone.",atheism,0

Whether the baby comes is irrelevant to your intent. Most people do not go over the speed limit with the intent of deliberately endangering pedestrians, but that doesn't mean that they aren't responsible for running someone over should that happen. 

&gt;You implied that the shot was a kill shot.

How does that change anything? The point of the analogy was that you can't consent to an action without consenting to the plausible consequences of that action. 

&gt;No, It's not. Again, consent to sex =/= consent to pregnancy. If it did, then the ONLY time people would have sex would be to make a baby. Clearly that's not the case.

People consent to the distinct possibility of pregnancy. They are effectively taking a risk - sure, they might hope that pregnancy doesn't happen, but that only signifies how consent doesn't matter in the case of pregnancy - it might or might not happen regardless of whether you consent to it. 

Take the analogy - if someone punches another person, they don't generally intend to kill. But the guy might die anyway - maybe he falls down and breaks his neck. He can't later say that he only consented to punching the guy (have sex), but he didn't consent to him dying (the possible consequence of sex - pregnancy). He'll be held responsible regardless and be told, that by wilfully activating the chain of events, he consented to whatever consequence that might come from his punch - from nothing, to a moderate injury, to even death. 

&gt;And as such, women have the freedom to end that pregnancy if they choose to.
&gt;What ""responsibilities"" are you talking about?

No, because the woman has now created a situation, where an innocent party is dependent on her for survival. In that situation, she has a moral obligation to rescue him.

"Don't like abortion? Don't get one. It's as simple as that. You think abortion is cruel and inhumane? Try being a rape victim, going through 9 months of pregnancy, then 18 years of raising a kid on your own, without a father, with little money and less time, having to drop out of college or quit a job, and having a constant reminder of that traumatic experience. Then, tell us about what is ""cruel"".",atheism,0

"Mission trips are not an efficient way to help people. The people you're trying to help would be much better off if you would stay home and send them the money you would have spent on an airline ticket. Then they could use that money to hire local people to build schools, dig sewers, etc., and the money would stay in their community instead of going to the airline. It might be different if you had a specialized skill that was in short supply in their country, for example, if you were a surgeon or a sanitation engineer and you were going there to practice your skill. But it makes no economic sense to send unskilled people halfway around the world to do things that local people could do.

So if now you are sending money instead of going on mission trips you may actually be doing more good.

Religions have evolved over millennia.

"I'll address your second question first. Maybe if I put it this way it will make more sense. When going to seek a service that could have a major impact on your life, unless the professional either a)knows your religious affiliation already or b)is providing a specifically religious service  I feel it is professionally inappropriate (note: not illegal) to inject a religious option. There's a good article about how asking non-religious people to pray is far more offensive and/or off- putting than most religious people realize. I forget where I read it unfortunately, but the gist is that non religious people don't particularly mind others participating in their own religious practices such as prayer (even in public), they dislike being asked to engage in prayer (or being told someone will pray for them) and other practices themselves. I'm not religious and this is my experience. I don't ever make an issue of it if it happens, and it doesn't ruin my day, but it IS off-putting.

To your first question, when I'm going in for a surgery and general anesthesia, the last thing I want to feel is any sort of confusion. If, out of the blue, my surgeon handed me this, I might wonder if the outcome of my surgery could be influenced by my response (even if unintentionally).

"I am sorry, this article immediately fails as a serious discussion by making all these ridiculous and false accusations about leading atheists, as its opening argument.  You are now telling me that the author of this article is not *actually* calling the atheists mentally ill or really psychotic.  I'm sorry to have to say, it certainly appears that he is.  So even if his intention was purely poetic and metaphorical, he is still bringing the discussion down to a level of character assassination.

We should be able to discuss the issue of religion vs. atheism by considering the actual arguments presented by either theists or atheists, and the degree to which these arguments succeed or fail based on their factual accuracy and logical quality, not based on personal attacks against the people who expressed them.

Given the chance, theocrats in many countries (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Singapore etc.) simply arrest people who are guilty of expressing a disagreement with religion, and execute them.  This resolves the argument perfectly.  If you can kill everybody who disagrees with you, then you must be right.  Or even if you are not right, nobody will ever dare to say so.  This is the philosophy of theism.  They never have to prove they are right, they just want to silence all voices of dissent by any means possible.

Since it is not possible to arrest Richard Dawkins for blasphemy and execute him, the next best strategy is character assassination.  Just accuse him of being insane, then you don't have to actually think about what he is saying or explain why you think he is wrong.

This is not how you go about exploring New Atheism as a cultural phenomenon or any of those things that you think this article is doing.  It is just an attempt to silence voices of dissent.  All this article is saying could be summarized as:  ""shut the fuck up.  Who cares what these lunatics are saying?  Now we must return to our urgent work of persecuting homosexuals.  Amen"".

It's worse in rural areas than in big cities. It's worse in areas that do not have racial, ethnic, and religious diversity.

I personally did not have that many problems. My parents were somewhat religious, but they belonged to a relatively liberal denomination. The city I lived in was somewhat diverse.

Yet all of this is immediately forgotten when a girl is born to a muslim family and from childhood brainwashed (by intense pressure from her whole community) into ""voluntarily"" wearing a sack over her head and playing the secondary role of a good covered up housewife. 

I'm not saying that feminists should support an outright ban on the thing because I can see how that doesn't go well with the modern ideas of freedom, but celebrating hijabs as some form of expression of female freedom is ridiculous. It should be seen for what it is, as an unfortunate relic from a backwards culture that can hopefully be discouraged and disappear sooner or later.",atheism,0

"&gt;I seriously don't give a shit about WND. Why do you keep trying to smear WND instead of addressing the things those people are saying?

Because that particular ""news"" organization just makes things up.  And that's your source.

&gt;These aren't Sudanese we're talking about. 

Why are you telling me the views of Sudanese refugees if you want to argue to keep out Syrian refugees?

&gt;Nope. They have every right to believe what they believe. And I have every right to not allow them to come here. 

In fact, you do not.  If you put into law a statement that ""these are the religions we allow in the US,"" that is a direct violation of the First Amendment.  

You *can* and we absolutely *should* ban people who advocate violence to achieve their political ends, or the overthrow of the government.  Essentially no one objects to that.  The objection is in the claim that simply being of a particular religion means you have those views.

&gt;I don't care about your atheist whataboutisms. 

In some sense, you're lucky.  Because you have the experience of being in a minority group.  I have had this same conversation with Evangelical Protestants, and if I point out that the same arguments leveled against Muslims today were once leveled against Catholics, their response is ""kick them out too.""  

The point is that going down the road of banning a religion because of your perception of beliefs among its members will inevitably be used to oppress people.  Every act of oppression is carried out by people who believe they mean well and are tolerant, but the oppressed group is ""too far"" and a threat to their own rights.

&gt;Muslims want Sharia. 

Have you ever talked with Muslims?  Maybe over a beer?  ""Wait"" you say, ""Muslims don't drink alcohol.""  But the reality is, some do.  I have actually gone to an Eid al Fitr celebration with Muslims, at a bar.  Of course, many do not drink.  But pretending that all Muslims believe one thing or another is pretty ludicrous.

"&gt;at what point

this is a stupidly easy quantification.

7-9 months.  Starting around 7 months is when lungs and a nervous system develop.  Before that it can't even think.  It takes until 9 months for these organs to actually function as they should, to develop fully and to actually be a human being.

So an abortion before 7 months is *definitely* not murder and an abortion before 9 months is *almost certainly* not murder.  But abortions performed after 6 months are only ever done for the safety of the mother anyways, at which point you're prioritizing someone who is *definitely* human over something that *might* be.

Which brings up the other stupidity of being anti-abortion.  When you die, we can't just take your organs, even if they're perfectly healthy and fine and could save people's lives.  We have to have your permission to take them, *even though you're dead and couldn't use them*.

So demanding a woman not have a say over her body is affording her less control over herself than we give to *dead people*.",atheism,0

"Since your OP hasn't delivered this ex-JW shall shed light.

The book of Acts, chapter 15 has a couple of passages pertaining to blood in which it says things to the effect of ""abstain from blood"" and ""don't consume blood""

Now, this generally was understood at the time to apply to meat. You had to eat meat that was properly bled, and JWs still adhere to this original concept as well (no blood pudding!). However, the organization has taken the liberty to interpret this particular verse in its most literal form to mean no blood, whatsoever.

&gt; What're the consequences for a JW if they do get a transfusion? 

Knowingly consenting to a transfusion would be grounds for expulsion from the church, though they'd have a tribunal (three elders meet with you to determine your repentance) and you may be able to stay, albeit with lost privileges and the stench of traitorism will linger on you like stink on a monkey.

&gt; Also, what if a child needs a transfusion?

Parents can legally deny it on religious grounds, and they have. Kids have died.

The situation is pretty rare though. Your OP is actually right about the JWs advancing a lot of bloodless surgery techniques which are safer and many times more effective, but likewise are more expensive and not available in many parts of the world.
