"The big shock for me (and it might just be my workplace) is how much people whine and whinge. I listen to complaints every darn day, staff slagging each other off, upsetting each other, undermining each other, grassing each other up, and so on. It was hard at first so I would say: don't take it personally. I used to wonder if it was me being a bad manager, but I now realise that people rarely change, and X will always whinge about Y and you can't change that. You can deal with problems and listen though. I sympathise but I very carefully don't get embroiled in bitching. I nod and listen and take steps to deal with problems but I will never be seen to choose a side. 

Also- value your team. Like really value them. Sometimes, I'm doing a multitude of tasks with 5 minutes til a meeting and somebody comes in to tell me something. I want to tell them to go away, but you've got to be approachable and you've got to be available. Praise anything and everything, no matter how small (Oh thank you for getting that paperwork to me early, good job! / I really like how you phrased that, great thinking) it really boosts morale. Have informal 5 minute team meetings (if appropriate) every few weeks so people can feel like they have a platform to speak (or whinge :) ). 

Sounds silly, but at the end of each half term I buy my team a little gift(usually a little box of chocolate i.e. Maltese rd) and go in early to leave it on their desk with a post it note saying 'thanks for your hard work this half term'. I have 7 in my team so that's £7 I'm willing to pay to make them smile. I got this from an old manager and it stuck with me, I always vowed to do it when I was a manager because, however silly it was, it made us feel like we were valued and thought of. 

Lastly, learn to delegate and learn to say 'not right now'. I'm terrible at this, so at first I was often overwhelmed by tasks as my team members  and my managers asked me to do things. I felt like I was being thrown things from all angles and got very stressed out. Now I make sure I delegate where I can, and I say no sometimes too - or more often, 'not right now but I'll schedule it for next week.' Including to my own managers. I'm honest and will say 'I need some time to do this, I cannot fit it in this week.' Don't be a yesman and get overwhelmed.

"What I don't understand is why females insist on entering male space and expecting to be treated differently.

"My name is The name of the fictional character Flash refers to multiple characters, the first to appear was Jay Garrick, who was featured in “The Flash Comics” in 1940. He later appeared in “All Star Comics” along with the original Green Lantern, Hawkman and other characters to form the Justice Society of America. Afterwards he got one more last solo series before becoming nearly unused ever since, only guest starring in later Flash comics and Justice Society comics.
Barry Allen is the second Flash, and is the most iconic and well known. Barry Allen first appeared in _""Showcase #4"" in 1956 and after a few issues of the series later took over the main Flash series at issue #105. Barry had a long run that lasted up until the characters death in the DC comics even “Crisis on Infinite Earths” in 1985. Barry Allen remained dead until his revival in the event “Final Crisis” (2008) where he returned as the main Flash again and took back the Flash series, and then became the Flash that carried into the company wide reboot New 52 and still remains the Flash. Barry Allen tends to appear as the Flash in the most media outside the comic books.
Wally West was the first Kid Flash and later the 3rd Flash becoming the sidekick to Barry (who is Wally’s uncle) in issue #110 of The Flash. He was also a member of the Teen Titans until the last issue of Crisis on Infinite Earths where he took over the mantle of the Flash. Wally remained as the Flash right until Final Crisis and the return of Barry Allen.

"I don't get it. I posted a completely sincere question about a situation in my life. The second moderator required me to remove all of the personal context. This is something that happened to me gradually during the last few years, and I'm trying to come to terms with it. Was trying to figure out if my interpretation was wildly crazy and off base. Judging by the torrent of hostility, which culminated in a declaration that I'm engaging in fap fodder, there is something very wrong with me. At least I now know that I shouldn't share my feelings about this with my wife... // These guidelines for a good posting to ""AskWomen"" are supposed to be about building an open, inclusive, accepting community, but the entire experience has made me feel like crap.  For the record, this was my previous post: This question is aimed at any women -- bi, straight, or trans -- who might find themselves in an emotional and physical relationship with someone who is ""biologically male"" and who presents as male.
If this person gradually developed small to medium sized breasts, how do you think you would react emotionally and physically? Would it freak you out? Would you be repulsed? Would you be intrigued or even aroused?
I am a bisexual man in his mid-40s who is married to a woman. During the past three years, I have gradually developed small-to-medium sized breasts. They're not so large that I would need to wear a bra, but there is definitely enough there to cup in part of the palm of one's hand.
Apparently, this is called gynecomastia. For some men, it's connected to obesity, but it can also happen to non-overweight men who have a low BMI. There are many theories about what causes this (e.g., hormones in our meat or estrogen in soy protein). All I know is that it is happening to me.
When I first noticed this, it freaked me out a bit. Not because of misogyny or a fear of female characteristics. (I'm a feminine man and my voice is often mistaken for a woman's voice on the phone.) I was mainly concerned because I associate this condition with overweight, middle-aged men. There's nothing wrong with being overweight, but it's not something that I want to be.
Upon further reflection, I kind of like my breasts. They are way more sensitive! And there is something that feels secretly transgressive and even kind of hot about knowing that I have breasts under my blazer and dress shirt. To be honest, I wouldn't be upset if they continued to grow a tiny bit more.
But I don't really have any reference point for this. My male friends certainly have talked about anything like this, I haven't read about it in SLATE or HUFFINGTON POST, and I have never encountered a fictional male character who is confronting this issue.
Just wondering what other women might think about this. Have you been with a man who had this condition? If so, what did you think/feel about it? Was it embarrassing? Did you like it?
Of course, the most important opinion about my breasts is that of my wife. When I first noticed them and said ""OMG, I have breasts,"" my wife felt obliged to reassure me that I was imagining things. But they have grown a bit since we had that conversation. We haven't really talked more about it, but I've noticed that she pays a bit of attention to them when we're fooling around.
I'm tempted to just ""own my breasts,"" and to tell my wife that I like them and she shouldn't be worried about hurting my male pride by acknowledging their existence. But I don't know if this revelation would make her uncomfortable. Although I identify as bisexual, she does not.
Hence, my question. I know that all types of women with many different orientations and perspectives read this forum, and I'm very interested in what all of you have to say. Thanks!

"There is no grand conspiracy about sexism against women.

Are there more men than women in movies? Sure. Yeah. Is that a good thing? No. Is it a bad thing? No. As long as it's not discrimination. And from what I'm seeing, there doesn't seem to be obvious discrimination.

Also, I re-read my comment and seems you're correct on the fact that I was unreasonably defensive. I apologize for that. It's a subject I, like others in this thread, am defensive about. 

Usually people would follow up on some shit like ""white male privilege"". And then they put out some shame on the person. I don't even feel bad about being white, it's just the tactic of bringing that shit up is the ultimate ""I'm better than you in two ways than one"".
And I know their purpose is to have me recognize my privilege (personally I don't think there is any such privilege but whatever), but it still makes others feel bad. If I went up to a black guy and said that his race contributes to 50% of the crime in the US, it might be factual, but it would still make him feel like shit.

Sorry for wall of text. I don't think sexism is a thing in the film industry, but males do tend to get more roles than women. Not a major overlap, but whatever.

"My name is The name of the fictional character Flash refers to multiple characters, the first to appear was Jay Garrick, who was featured in “The Flash Comics” in 1940. He later appeared in “All Star Comics” along with the original Green Lantern, Hawkman and other characters to form the Justice Society of America. Afterwards he got one more last solo series before becoming nearly unused ever since, only guest starring in later Flash comics and Justice Society comics.
Barry Allen is the second Flash, and is the most iconic and well known. Barry Allen first appeared in _""Showcase #4"" in 1956 and after a few issues of the series later took over the main Flash series at issue #105. Barry had a long run that lasted up until the characters death in the DC comics even “Crisis on Infinite Earths” in 1985. Barry Allen remained dead until his revival in the event “Final Crisis” (2008) where he returned as the main Flash again and took back the Flash series, and then became the Flash that carried into the company wide reboot New 52 and still remains the Flash. Barry Allen tends to appear as the Flash in the most media outside the comic books.
Wally West was the first Kid Flash and later the 3rd Flash becoming the sidekick to Barry (who is Wally’s uncle) in issue #110 of The Flash. He was also a member of the Teen Titans until the last issue of Crisis on Infinite Earths where he took over the mantle of the Flash. Wally remained as the Flash right until Final Crisis and the return of Barry Allen.

"My rant is very TMI but I think it's infuriating and also a bit funny.
So last week, I was with my boyfriend at our local bar and I got shitfaced - like, the most drunk I've just about ever been. And I see this girl I know a bit. Now the thing is, see, my boyfriend and I have been talking about having a threesome for a long time. I'm basically blackout drunk at this point and somehow my brain decides that this is going down. This is happening. I don't even remember talking to this girl in the bar, but apparently, as my boyfriend put it, I'm shoving my tongue down her throat. 

So my next memory is puking my guts out in the toilet at home. I do that for a few minutes and head back up to the bed that my boyfriend and this girl are already in. They're doing the deed and I try to join in, but I'm really not feeling good, and when she calls me Jasmine, which is NOT my name, I get out of the bed in a good hurry and proceed to start back into my whole puking routine. As you probably all know, vomiting repeatedly whilst nearly blackout drunk isn't the most pleasant experience and so when I feel a little better I somehow get myself to the couch and pass out for some unknown amount of time. I'm woken up to my boyfriend shaking me awake, and this is where the story really gets fucked. He's saying, ""I was wondering why the bathroom smelled bad. There's a massive poop sitting on the floor.""

My tile floor is heated. This bitch has literally shat on my floor. Here's the deal. There's no toilet paper anywhere so either she never wiped her ass, or else she did wipe her ass and then flushed the toilet and left her shit on the floor intentionally. I don't know which is worse. Also, I'm blackout drunk and I KNOW I would never do such a thing. Better yet, because the tile floor is heated, this shit is basically hotboxing my bathroom right now. Thank Christ I was drunk enough to handle the cleanup, because I could never have done it without a copious amount of alcohol in my system. I'm too horrified at this point to even talk or think about it, so I clean it up, go to bed with my boyfriend in our spare room and pass the fuck out.

When it was all said and done, I disinfected the floor three times, threw out a sheet and lost all my interest in threesomes. I also resisted the urge to be rude as hell when I saw the girl a few days later, but I might not be such a good person next time I see her. That's the end of my rant, I'm still horribly frustrated and shocked and annoyed and disgusted that a girl shit on my floor. ",AskWomen,1

I had a couple of close friends and was just polite to everyone else. It takes a lot of effort/alcohol for me to be friendly enough to make someone like me. 

My husband is now the boss of a division of a large company.

"It's funny because I've always been the opposite. It has been rare for me to have crushes on guys my age. I can count on my two hands the number. When when I was very little I always had big things for my brothers friends (8 years older) and males in boy bands or in movies I liked. When I started dating in college at 18, I figured out very quickly there was almost no reason to date guys younger than 22 because of maturity level. My most successful relationships have been with men 6-15 years older than me. I started dating older and older as I made friends with lots of veterans in their 30s, and eventually made the jump to dating 35-50 as a 21 year old. I can honestly say that I have been the happiest in these flings/relationships and it is now very VERY hard for me to find men younger than 25-30 sexually and romantically attractive, much less someone I'm interested in a building an entire life with.... 
And I don't think I have ever been ""the first young girl"" these men date, and definitely not the first to at least show interest even if it's not reciprocated.

"In the beginning of high school I was the bubbly, friendly, sporty, who could get along with anybody and everybody type - I was always able to fit right in wherever I desired and I was good at many things mainly at sport (especially in track) and music. I was a high achiever, a socialite, a leader, a sportsperson and throughout primary/high school I've been vice sports captain, prefect, src a few times and not by popularity contest etc. but by my enthusiasm in leading and pushing others for the better. It may look bright and shiny on the outside to others, but on the inside I felt like It was never good enough for myself. I'm an Asian chic born in Aus and where I grew up as a kid, it was bombarded with a majority of aussies, abos, islanders, lebos and very few asians. I was never the overachieving student with straight A's, I was more of the laid back student who never studied, gets their shit done, hang out with mates, do sports, and play games. So I felt like I never fit in to any group since a majority of the time in high school I've spent in an all girls school. Stereotypes I found throughout high school were nerds, emos, girly girls, dykes, sporty chicks, geeks.

Nerds - we got along very well in class, but I didn't want to seem nerdy so I avoid them out of class

Emos - really fun bunch, I could also get along with but didn't want to be associated with them or people would think I'm weird

Girly girls (sluts) - they liked me but I didn't like them because they were boring, dumb, plastic and all they care about was dick, like we could relate since I had a boyfriend, but that's about it lol.

Dykes - were cool until they cracked onto u

Sporty chicks - these girls I got along with the best because I would always be around them to train and they were usually cool, but they were horrible to be in class with because most of them were air heads

Geeks - they were the best companions to game with which I were closest with since I was mad gamer back then, but yeah nah I wouldn't walk around with them

I could pretty much get along with everyone but I didn't want to be close to anyone because I don't want to be seen associated with any of those types, I wanted to be unique.

I didn't get along with most of the Asians in school because we had no common interests and most Asians chics weren't allowed to hang out anyway.

I got bored fairly easily, so I didn't hang with school mates.

To my classmates I was considered the girl who knew everything, never needed to study, never tried in class. Often I would annoy them because I talked a lot. But did I care? No. because I learnt to not give a fuck half way through school life.

To my teachers I was considered a smart girl who had the potential to do anything I want but never had the drive to.

My interests were tattoos, piercings, fitness, looking good and pretty much doing the opposite and rebelling high school

I realised I just wasn't cut out for school after a few punch ons, 4 different schools, a few suspensions and etc.

I ended up hanging out in crowds who like to drink, party and slowly stopped going to school to become a full time sick cunt

Dating at the time was awesome, without fail I was always in a long-term relationship at some point.

"It certainly took a while to get used to him. The dude can be a little bossy and overbearing and seemed to be all about the next adventure rather than working a relationship into the mix (we're a huge tribe of outdoor dirtbags who live for that adventure, so I can understand, but still, ditching your girl to make it to the next hut is kinda a dick move while she's hoofing by herself), and to be quite honest I disliked him at first. Then my sister fell in love, and I really had to start paying attention to him, seeing what he was all about.  Was hard for me to see past the irritating stuff. His good qualities began to outshine the not so good. He's hella smart, fabulous backwoodsman, tough as nails, thinks well on his feet, great climber, back country skier, etc. Passionate about the outdoors.  And he loves my sister. He can still be kind of a dick (mainly me being the knit picky spinster older sister that still has the faded memory of a beloved disney childhood), but he changed to accommodate her and she him. It was kinda interesting to see how their lives changed minutely to fit the other person's like two puzzle pieces. He became more patient and more her focused because she matters to him, she she got tougher and more extroverted. Gooiest thing I've ever written.

Anyway. He's cool, still over bearing but way more patient (he gave me an avi beacon and probe lesson and was chill with us being out in sub zero temps for overan hour while I hunted for the prob in the snow til I could find it quick). Anyway. New people coming into your tribe is hard, I totally get that. It may work out it may not, but people change (or they don't), and humans are messy and interesting.

"As man, I don't feel it's unusual for a woman to not orgasm from PIV, sure some will, but majority I've known wouldn't, which is why we learn other methods. I certainly feel for you, because you are missing out, but also not teaching these guys the proper way to do things, and they may go through life not knowing any different, and at the same time you're faking yourself out of ever getting proper orgasms during sex.

While I may not have known any difference 20 years ago, these days, a fake orgasm would be completely obvious to me, due to the body language surrounding it, and usually the need to change the sheets that comes with it.

Not everyone is into the same thing. It will take me forever to orgasm from oral, no matter the partner or the skill level, so more often than not, I wouldn't expect to; now I obviously can't fake it, but wouldn't even if I could, as I prefer to work with my partner on methods that will bring things to conclusion in an enjoyable way and not leave me with resentment.

Also neither my partner or I feel the need to bring each other to conclusion each and every time, sometimes it's her, sometimes it's me, sometimes neither (kids, dogs, etc), but we still try to enjoy ourselves.

It also seems, from other posts, there are a lot of very selfish and uneducated men in the bedroom, but it does make me wonder why they were ever allowed to get to that point. I do think with anything, you shouldn't reward someone for a job that's not done, and that might be part of the problem with faking things.

"> The stereotype/gender role is instituted by patriarchal institutions for the benefit of men. 

If that was true, why are there are so many examples of men being discriminated against and oppressed relative to women? 

For instance, most people know that black people face discrimination in the legal system, relative to white people. What many do not know is that men face far greater discrimination relative to women - the gender disparity is several times greater than the racial black/white disparity.

>After controlling for the arrest offense, criminal history, and other prior characteristics, ""men receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do,"" and ""[w]omen are…twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted."" This gender gap is about six times as large as the racial disparity that Prof. Starr found in another recent paper.

"My name is The name of the fictional character Flash refers to multiple characters, the first to appear was Jay Garrick, who was featured in “The Flash Comics” in 1940. He later appeared in “All Star Comics” along with the original Green Lantern, Hawkman and other characters to form the Justice Society of America. Afterwards he got one more last solo series before becoming nearly unused ever since, only guest starring in later Flash comics and Justice Society comics.


Barry Allen is the second Flash, and is the most iconic and well known. Barry Allen first appeared in _""Showcase #4"" in 1956 and after a few issues of the series later took over the main Flash series at issue #105. Barry had a long run that lasted up until the characters death in the DC comics even “Crisis on Infinite Earths” in 1985. Barry Allen remained dead until his revival in the event “Final Crisis” (2008) where he returned as the main Flash again and took back the Flash series, and then became the Flash that carried into the company wide reboot New 52 and still remains the Flash. Barry Allen tends to appear as the Flash in the most media outside the comic books.


Wally West was the first Kid Flash and later the 3rd Flash becoming the sidekick to Barry (who is Wally’s uncle) in issue #110 of The Flash. He was also a member of the Teen Titans until the last issue of Crisis on Infinite Earths where he took over the mantle of the Flash. Wally remained as the Flash right until Final Crisis and the return of Barry Allen.

"God where do I start? The final straw was when she didn't tell me that my grandfather had died and, therefore, I missed the funeral and the ability to grieve for my grandfather. This was the man that took me in after the state of California determined that she was an unfit mother when I was 10. My grandma and grandpa taught me how to love without anger or violence. When they became ill in my early 20's, I rushed to be by their side. Family politics forced me out -- my mother said I was just after their money -- and I was barred from seeing them. He died a few weeks later. 

That was Christmas of 2010. I haven't spoken to her since and I've become a much better person without her in my life. She was never a champion for me, for her kids. She was a weight.

I'm not married and I'm sort of afraid to ever get married for this reason. What if I didn't deserve to be cheated on and was anyway just because american culture is like that? 

So any ladies who have cheated on a good man, how did it go down? Was this guy on the side just that irresistible? Did it happen so quickly you didn't even mean to? Are these excuses valid for women? Its treated so much differently when we as men cheat because ""men are men"" and therefore just dogish and think with their dicks. Supposedly.",AskWomen,1

"I helped her plan her bachelorette party and wedding for months. Spent a bunch of money to go to the party- out of town, spent a ton of time setting up for the wedding because she didn't have anything ready- I did 70% of the decorating and had to make it up as I went. Spent the whole night helping with food, guests, and diverting her away from family drama. Her best friend and maid of honor didn't show to the party, even thought the bride offered to pay for her share of everything, and then didn't show up to the wedding. I stepped in last minute to be witness/maid of honor. 

Didn't hear from her for 5 months. Turns out, she was on meth and didn't want to deal with me. Because I'm a good friend and won't put up with that shit. I told her I was proud of her for getting clean- she claimed 3 weeks at the time. I told her I would be here for her while she got back on her feet and tried to stay clean. I know it's hard and I only asked that she not come around my house after using. She promised and said she understood. 3 days later shows up high- I was outside with my daughter. Had her leave. Talk on and off through fb messenger for 4 days and then get a long ass message about how she doesn't need me and my bullshit in her life, she's doing the best she ever has and is the happiest she has ever been and if I can't see that then to fuck off. A bunch of other stuff- a sob story about her ""hard"" life, bullshit from my past- 6 years in the past and some other nonsense. I told her to fuck off and blocked her fucking face. This morning I got a friend request from a new account she made. The shit message was 4 days ago.

"Rape by a stranger IS rare. Most rapists are known to their victim (family friend, family member, acquaintance). 



There are also other types of sexual assault in addition to the one we see on law & order: SVU (i.e. digital penetration, penetration with a foreign object, oral rape). And there are too many people for whom consent is a gray area (""s/he wanted it at the beginning of the night, but then got too drunk but I had sex with him/her anyway"" = rape. ""She's my girlfriend and I wanted to have sex with her but she didn't want to"" - rape. ""She was giving off all the right signals and she gave me a BJ, but then she wouldn't put out but I really knew she wanted it"" = rape. Morally and in the eyes of the law) 



Why don't you have a quick squizz at the current statistics so you can see that, in fact, rape is far too common. Unless you are one of those people who don't believe statistics are real because women lie all the time and most reports aren't even real. In that case maybe you can call your local Rape Crisis Centre, or Sexual Assault Response Service, or Sexual Assault Squad or local hospital that administers forensic kits (rape kits) and have a brief chat to them to find out how rare rape is.


And then maybe punch yourself in the fucking face, because you're a cunt :)

"I'm Asian and it's affected me pretty heavily on racial perspective regarding dating. 

Being Asian but raised in America, I am less inclined to find an Asian man attractive. This is because Asian culture is very strong even across the pond and Asian cultures are a little behind on gender equality. Sexism is still running rampant in the country that I'm from. Asian men continue those beliefs here and maybe they're not as sexist, they still believe that the perfect woman is docile, home-makers, weak, and obedient. 

Being Asian has also attracted me a lot of unwanted attention, particularly black and Latino men on the streets. It's scary and intimidating. I still think black and Latino men in general are attractive, but if one of them came up to me on the streets, I would run the fuck away because I'm not about to deal with that sketchy shit.

What I am trying to point out is merely that rewarding people for something they don't get right isn't going to teach them anything. Even when you say that it turns into a ""big thing"", that ""they need to solve"", to me this again suggests a lack of education and communication on the situation, and this is what I feel is a deeper issue. I am fully aware that everyone is different. For example, I posted in another thread to agree with some guys that I don't orgasm from oral. If someone went on a mission to try to do so, I would explain to them that it's not a problem, just how it is, and that I need more than just that sensation to orgasm, but if I could fake it, and did so, then that person would continue to do that, thinking they are awesome at it, when in reality they aren't.

I would guess based on my experience, that most people in the bedroom behave a certain way because of what they have learned from previous partners.

I know there are more stereotypical views of what 'being a man' means, but even when I was young and impressionable I can't remember ever really agreeing with that personally. I personally couldn't, and can't, see what would make someone who was a man/identified as a man, NOT a man.

I watched a cracking documentary the other night called *The Queen Of Versailles* about the 'trophy wife' of an American property mogul. The doc was originally supposed to be about this family building and moving into their ridiculously huge and gaudy new mansion but during the filming, the market collapsed and, while they were still very rich, they lost a *lot.* Obviously, it completely changes the tone of the film. Watching these people try to cope in dramatically different circumstances was fascinating.

"She was a roommate I had in college. At the time I just thought she was a huge asshole, but looking back on my experiences with her and those I saw her have with other people, I've been thinking she may have been a sociopath.

She was extremely manipulative and always knew how to play people against one another to further her own ends. For example there were 5 of us girls living together and there was always at least one roommate who was being ostracized by the rest of the house because the sociopathic girl decided she didn't like them and would convince everyone else to not like them too by telling lies about them and just generally causing issues. 

She also felt no remorse for the terrible things she did and said to other people. She would say the meanest things to my face and it didn't affect her at all. One time she kicked one of my other roommate's family out of our house purely because she didn't want them there, and expressed no remorse at all for being so utterly rude and bitchy. 

Everything was constantly about how other people were wronging her in some way. Everything was always somebody else's fault besides her own.

No one wants to have to put work into a friendship, clashes like the example above are work. Male-Male friendships are easier than Male-Female, at least at the start.

"I don't get what YOUR point is. YouTube is a platform on which people can perform, and people performing on it is what makes it profitable. No one goes to an empty stadium for the lulz. No one would go to YouTube if there was no content. And people wouldn't devote their entire lives to creating better and better videos if there was no money in it. YouTube needs the content creators more than content creators need YouTube, because without them there would be little worth going there for, and thus there would be no reason to become attached to it and its veritable cornucopia of content. But your first post was all about how YouTube is doing some unprecedented, magnanimous thing by giving people who contribute a slice of its pie. The same thing happens in cable. Show producers and content networks work out a contract with a cable company because they need a cable company to distribute their show and cable companies need shows to distribute, and everyone gets paid. Ignoring the creator side of the coin for YouTube is like ignoring the creator side of the coin for cable. Except cable is more established and thus people have an easier time accepting that content networks be paid for the shows they make because such an idea is so ingrained in the cultural zeitgeist. I thought that since the idea that YouTube creators ought to be paid for getting people to spend time on their site seemed to elude you that maybe a more established example would make you understand why you are wrong.",AskWomen,1

They'd ask me, I'd deny it. They'd lock me up for ""observation"" to have me come to ""realize"" my delusions. That didn't work, because, you know, no delusions. Eventually she shortcutted to calling the police and telling them i attacked her and had a history of being in mental institutions. They'd lock me up. I was in and out for a year.

We why men stalk is simple really, seeing the face of a women that we crush on really makes our day. It enlightens our mood and we get fresh oxygen.

Using voice changers to call them and pretend to be phone sellers to hear their voices. Sending fake government-issued surveys to know more about them in general.

I did all this, and I do it because I feel it is necessary to understand the potential woman that I am going to date and be with, and the chance of rejection decreases significantly as I study the material gathered and make my assumptions and decisions based on them.

Expensive. As. Fuck. 

They're always trying to murder themselves. They get a little better for awhile then teenage years come and they get self murdery all over again. 

Manipulative little shits. Whether it be words, smile, pout, coo or tear. 

My tits are wrecked. *milk came outta them!!!*

Everyone has an opinion on your pregnancy, delivery, and how you raise your pups. Fuckoff. I only take advice from my drug dealer. 

They get bitey for a little while and will masturbate publicly for (hopefully) a very short period of time. 

They are snotty and drooly germ machines for awhile. So much facial secretions. 

If you're very unlucky,  they'll want to talk about shit that makes you uncomfortable when they're teens. 

Prom dresses are expensive. Same with hobbies, clothes, makeup, sports, field trips, food, toys...if you are selfish or may be single, think twice before having some. 

Labor really fucking hurts. Like, really. And it will freak your shit out looking down at your vag and seeing a human head that looks like you popping outta your junk. 

Sick and hurt babies make your world stop spinning. 

Sleep deprivation is real and will cause you to think weird shit. Go take a nap. 

You may. It feel overwhelming love for your baby like you hear others say they feel. I thought I was a psychopath. Nope. Just tired. 

You may want to kill your child occasionally. Don't. But don't beat yourself up if you get the urge to shake them. Just don't. Walk away. If you think about it a lot, tho, get help. They won't die from crying in a crib while you sit in the steps and put your mind back together. 

Random fevers. They send them home if they have a fever. Which means you gotta leave work. They get fucking fevers from teeth erupting. Wtf?

Lice. Oh god, the never ending lice.

Daycare is expensive af. 

You are in a daze for a full year after giving birth. 

Irrational guilt? Sure, I'll have a large helping. 

They will state the obvious or tell secrets:""mommy that lady has a great big butt"" or ""mommy, I thought you said uncle marky was a sociopathic loser?""

They can cock block like a mofo 

Seriously, they try to kill themselves quite often. Running in parking lots. Going up to strangers. Putting anything and everything in their face holes. Stairs. Sharp things. If they hurt themselves sometimes they'll run and hide instead of scream for you. These are always very bad situations.

Then I started to go through our relationship. What can I do if we were still together? The answer is that I can do nothing about it as well. I live with my parents and I do not get a job, and there is a lot to do before I really become dependent and start a real life with her. I do love her, but only love is not enough in a relationship.
So I just realize that what I should do is to focus on what I'm doing right now, and become a better person. Maybe I'll meet another person, or maybe I'll have a time to meet her in the future, at least at that time I will be independent enough to be with the person I love.
It's a lesson I learned, when I cant deal with something, just think of what you can do right now. Coz if the things are something you can do nothing about right now, you just can do nothing. Leave it, and focus on what you can do, then maybe one day you will get what you want.",AskWomen,0

Don't worry about the people who are telling you that your pain is not as bad as it seems. Listen to your body and investigate what you can do. 

I have had tummy problems for years. After being diagnosed with endo I realised the connections between my tummy problems and endo. I am currently testing my lactose tolerance which may be a factor to my problems. Other things could be FODMAPS, dairy overall, red meat, gluten, etc. There is an ""endo diet"" which covers a whole lot of this if you want to research it. I haven't done it myself as it is very strict and I'd rather find what works for me one by one rather than cutting out lots of food at once.

"Yeah, there are a handful of things decided by what hormones you were on during your first round of puberty. Those things come out when you're looking to compete at the absolute top level of your sport- like even though my muscles have wasted away and I'm an average girl muscle-wise, I don't think I should be able to compete in like Olympic weight-lifting because my muscles DO have a slight difference to muscles that initially developed under the influence of oestrogen. 

Until you hit the big leagues, though, it really doesn't make enough of a difference that I would say males &amp; females can't compete with each other in most contexts. 

I'd fit right in on most women's sports teams, even though I'm AMAB, because of the way that oestrogen has changed my body. Average person to average person in relaxed, fun sports being played as a hobby, the main deciding difference is what hormones their body is currently running.",AskWomen,0

Pro tip for people who are squeamish eating in restaurants alone: sit at the bar!!! The bartender and other solo travelers talk to you. It's fun!

Go shopping alone, go to a show alone, pretend you are invisible and just do whatever you want! You can walk as slow or as fast as you want, go into whatever place you want, or just swim in the pool all day!

"Writing one of them and calling it a day.

Women make up 50% of the population.  It doesn't matter how *perfectly feminist* your one character is.  If there's one of them, in a world populated by mostly men, it's not only a weird and jarring signal for any women reading your thing that ""this media is not for you"", but your character has to become the stand in for all women.  If she ever needs help, she's ""saying that women are weak and in need of rescuing"".  If she doesn't, you're ""saying that women must be physically strong and resilient or they're not worth talking about.""  If she's pretty, she's ""obviously just eye candy"".  If she's not, she ""must be desexualized in order to do anything.""

I've had some trouble making friends, because foreigners tend to leave after a year or two and Koreans are extremely insulated (I can speak conversational Korean now, and it still hasn't helped all that much.)

I have a friend (gal in her late 30's) who does long distance through hiking and in doing so she hitchhikes regularly from the trail to surrounding trail towns. She's been doing so for years now and is currently hiking through Australia and has hitched there a few times already. Thankfully she has never had any troubles in doing so, but I think a bit factor in that is that she is doing it along major hiking routes where such things are common. If I happened to live along one of the trails and could easily recognize the through hikers, then I'd probably be more likely to give them a ride. ",AskWomen,0
