On the other side of the coin, these cheaters are scaring away lots and lots of players who are willing to spend money buying keys to open cases and other things in-game, thus making them alot more profitable to have in the game.

"> I cringe, because you don't have to be a good CS:GO player to understand the game at a highly competitive highly technical level. Many casters/analysts do and they are not good CS:GO players.

Most casters' understanding and analysis of the game is superficial at best. Most players on mid level teams have a better understanding of the game, they're just not able to express it as well or have the same ""personality"" as most casters.

>So, who are we, users of reddit and professional players of CS:GO, to question game design with some of the most talented people in the industry?

Because we actually play the game at a decent level? Every retard could see that the R8 would be a bad idea, so why couldn't Valve?

>Do we actually believe for a second, that we could develop a better version of CS:GO than Valve - and if so; why don't we?

"Don't understand this game? Literally laughed out loud.

I watch 10-14 hours of pro CS a day and make more via betting than I do at my day job, because I better than most people can look at players/teams and identify strengths/weaknesses and gauge the real odds and then play them accordingly.  I have a very deep and good understanding of pro CS.

Yesterday vs Fnatic, Stewie lost at least 2-3 rounds which in turn put C9 onto garbage buys and ecos.

Then stewie will go and clutch out a round that his team wouldn't have needed him to clutch had he not made a mistake earlier, followed by him getting a whole bunch of eco kills, resulting in him having a higher rating.

The casual viewers will watch these games and think that Stewie is playing phenomenally.  While he has vastly improved since he joined C9, he is consistently making huge mistakes which not only cost C9 rounds, but cost them games.  Hardly what I'd consider the best player on this team.

He still has a LONG way to go in terms of his in game decision making at a pro level.

"Depends entirely on the map and side actually, current CS is moving away from the whole IGL, Entry, second, support, lurker IMHO. Especially on Fnatic. 

Wenton has been playing more of the small/forward/aggressive (whatever you call it) anchor role on CT (e-box/sandwich on train, pit area on d2, A main in cbble for instance). His ""role"" in this instance is to get the first frag, and when he is traded do it in a way so that the secondary player can refrag. Take train for example. Lets say the set up is that twist is holding ivy passively with the awp, dennis is posted up on second carriage/sandwich watching main, and Wenton is at e box watching popdog. In this case, Lekr0 generally pushes to the forward of B site (occasionally aggro brown halls), with Olof is a rotation based role in connector based on information given. If the Ts come out of popdog, Wenton's role is to kill the first and put olof/dennis in a position to get the kills. The longer he can stay alive the better, and any damage he can put on thereafter is a massive bonus as the Ts have to be wary of this aggressive CT. Now he did a good job of that today in pit on D2, but yesterday on train was another story. He had 2 kills by round 8 (appx) in that role and was constantly  slightly out of position and allowing cheap entry onto the site. Now if he can have performances like today, then that's great and I'll be the first to sing his praises, but I'm not sold on two entirely polar performances. Consistency is key in this role. Think Krimz early 2015 as a B anchor for comparison. 



On T, Fnatic have a play style which we haven't seen all too much on when it comes to sophisticated tactics and executions, i do expect that to change. However, at the moment they seem to have 3 main styles: 1: Default setup. 2: 5 man stack/ 4 man + close lurk. 3: essentially 2 sets of fire squads. For default rounds, they spread around the map in different locations based upon what the general call is to gain map control, in this case, then he is exactly a support player, definition of it. However, Fnatic rarely use this kind of set up, without then moving into on of the second two moves (more often the set of fire squads rather than a 5 man. In the 5 man, he is again, in the supportive roles. However, when it comes to the fire squads he generally acts at the lurker, or Olof's/Lekro's partner. Generally the 2 duos are Dennis+Twist, and Olof+Lekro. Now depending on the strat/ time in round, who is dead, Olof can move into the lurker role, and Wenton into the entry role for Olof. Now they go aggressive in this style the majority of rounds that you watch in this style, even if they end up doing an execution. That's why i think it's unfair to call him a cookie cutter ""support player"". Does he have a supportive role? Sure. But calling him a pure support player is a little off the mark imho.

So, we end up back to what the amount of frags he should get in a map. I'm not saying he has to go off like he did today, but I would hope for a solid amount of impact frags in the game. It could be 8 in a half for all i care, so long as he played his position properly and set the team up for success. If he can get to a position in between his Train and D2 levels, then he can be a super solid player. I just think he is too hot and cold to be considered a success for this team.  

Like i said before, I **really** want him to succeed, I'll never not cheer for anyone in Fnatic colours. But he is potentially the weakest point in the team currently. Which is why I said I was ""not sold since he is no longer the IGL"".",GlobalOffensive,0

"Yea. When you're one of the strat heavy tacticians that makes your team perform ""x%"" better it might be worth. I just feel like for your team to be truly competitive and win games over a loger period of time you need more than 1 player to lean on. Let's say when Sean was playing for c9 and they had some short glory. If he didn't have a good day or did any calls, freakzoid would've played shit and maybe some of the other players too, maybe n0thing would've done the same becuz he just does whatever he feels like anyways and dosn't pay as much attention to the tacs as freak did. But a team that relies heavily on ""One leader, tactician"" crumbles alot easier? than a team that has 5 playmakers who can get an entry and give info and the team does whatever based on that information. I don't know what I'm trying to say but i agree with what you said, and whatever is the best dynamic depends on what players you have in the team and so many factors like lan, comfort, stress, off-day and all the kind of shit.

Lets be real here for a moment. I honestly don't think that we need it to the same level of degree as regular sports. We just don't have any performance enhancing drugs that drastically improve your game.,GlobalOffensive,0

If Shox isn't going crazy, they lose, if Shox *is* going crazy but nobody else is playing well, they still lose.",GlobalOffensive,0
