Knowing how to line up qs is crucial. know th timing how to hit them when the enemy comes out of your ult. Try to shoot them through minions to ht the enemies behind it. also the angle in which it searches for an object behind it is very wide so you can get some very weird angled stuns with it. Dont press q if you are only sure that you will hit the slow part of it. only doo it if you want to catch an enemy need the damage or wont be traded back in lane.

> Your w should mostly be used for the movement speed buff it provides. While the heal is nice it also costs a lot of mana. If you have the mana to spare youc an place some w's a chime will almost restore all the mana that wrequires so 1 chime --> 1 heal.

>there are also some tricks with e for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cer0Fy_e98M
try to have e on quickcast with indicator or just normal cast so you can place the direction of your tunnels better. it is mostly used in your roaming so learn how to place them on difficult spots like the thin walls around midlane to travel the longside of it. also very useful to tunnel your jungler in from different anglest the thick wall when you are red side is a good example. Also in teamfights use it to tunnel carrys out or divrs in or use it reposition yourself so you can land an easier q.

>the ult has way too many usages to count them them. aside from starting a teamfight, disengaging, saving a teammate from a skill or dot. towerdiving,stalling for time or isolating the backline from the frontline in teamfights there are many more. Dont be afraid to make mistakes bard as a champion can be very punishing during the learn process but try everything out and learn from them.

- **Description:** Sometimes the death recap screen displays some gibberish for the spell name

- **Video / Screenshot:** http://i.imgur.com/jdjxQ5C.png

- **Steps to reproduce:** Get killed, click death recap, and hope it randomly happens, it doesn't occur very often

I dont know why all the world got a problem with us, we are not all alike ya know ?

I once talked about returning to the game they told me they will definitly return if there was a better ping. 
Dont think of it as just 20 people i know, think of it as like in every 100 person there would be at least 50 who play league of legends. Its true, this game is very popular and i guess it would get even more popular because most of Dota 2 players are now in a chaos because of this 6gb update (the map is badly adjusted).

And I do appreciate that you're not afraid to experiment with rhyme scheme (ABAB, AABB, etc). Verse is primarily about feel and it, above all, a very personal form of expression. So finding your comfort is very important -- I didn't mean to sound harsh initially, I just assumed you had more practice.

As for the idea of flow, I would suggest working on your feel for iambs. It's a little abstract at first if you aren't used to writing with it in mind, but eventually it will become second nature.

Without Exhaust Faker is going to instantly kill Jensen regardless of Meteos.

He either had to Flash the stun, and avoid FB, or save exhaust and give Meteos a chance to salvage the lane. He did neither. 

There's nothing Meteos could have done, because Jensen disrespected Elise at level 5, and then Syndra got a level advantage.

He said Crown traded better early, Bjerg made a great decision buying refillable pot on his first back, and then said he was just straight up outplaying him.

After the first kills top they didnt really talk about that specific matchup in as much detail because of how the game went. Also worth noting AlexIch agreed with everything he said, and they definitely let AlexIch do the lions share of the talking... I think they just like LS to compare in lane matchups and since the inlane matchup in this one was over pretty quickly the entire stream kinda took a different angle. 

At the end LS said TSM needs to work on where they search for wards, how they position around objectives when they have a lead/how to read enemy movements based on where their wards are/where they have searched for wards, but overall they played totally great. 

He also said Bjerg was a top 3 mid at worlds, TSM would take a game from SSG (as would RNG), make it out of groups, and probably make it to semis.",leagueoflegends,0
