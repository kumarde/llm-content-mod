"Alright fuckers, sit down and buckle up because I'm tired of going through and trying to explain to you ignorant assholes why you shouldn't still be mad at Michael Vick almost a decade later.

Let me start by saying, of course what Vick did was a horrible disgusting thing and he absolutely deserved to be punished. And as we all know, he was punished with the maximum allowable sentence. 

His first press conference after conviction felt very forced. It was very much a ""shit, I got caught"" type apology. However, since he was released, he has been nothing short of a model citizen, community leader, and human being.

He has gone to capital hill to help pass new legislation in dealing with animal cruelty crimes. He has donated countless time, effort, and money to various animal rights groups. 

I understand saying that what Vick did was wrong, but to continue saying he's still a piece of shit after showing a genuine change in his life, makes you the piece of shit for not having enough compassion and understand to forgive a man who knows he made a mistake and has done as much as humanly possible to correct that mistake.

"Its called McCarthyism. Trump has nothing to do with the KKK. Never did. Its slanderous to malign trump with kkk and quite frankly, pretty sad. He has sacrificed so much to help this country out. Hes giving up a golden palace to downgrade to the whitehouse. Hes refusing his president salary. He spent $150million of his own money and 150million from the people and small donations. Hes beholden to no one and anyone saying otherwise is full of chit

Buddy, the KKK is standard fear mongering tactics of the democrats. Ironic since they started the KKK. But the democrats need a 85% turn out from the black community or they lose. Every 4 years they drag the KKK out of the barn and dust it off. News outlets report all these hoax hate crimes. It was brutal this year. You cant blame trump. You cant! He has never said anything about black people. He has brought up radical islam and illegal aliens. Islam is an ideology, a horribly oppressive one at that, thats waging war on the west. Not just here, but abroad as well. This is why theres a surge of populism across europe and here in america. Mexican is a nationality like american. And for some reason being american or having american pride has been conflated with hate speech. Everyone is allowed to have a culture by western european countries and america, i guess? 

Did you happen to see the leaked george soro email where he called the death of freddy grey a ""unique opportunity?"". This really paved the way for the BLM movement that has led to such racial division. They were around before trump was. Did you see the email of soros from 2009 expressing the need for a ""progressive echo chamber""? This is important. Because soros was a major funder of Obamas and Hillarys second biggest contributer, next to the saudis. He destablizes nations for a living. In his own words, hes there to make money and doesnt care about the social ramifications of what he does. Hes also a nazi collaborator. A judenrat. A jewish person under nazi rule who turned in his fellow jewish people. He would do this and sell their belongings. Only 15 at the time, but refers to it as the happiest time of his life. You point the finger at trump or his supporters but im asking you to take a long hard look. 

The party's never switched sides. Reps/dems. I'll prove it to you. I know the leftist and democratic folklore of the southern strategy and goldwater. But lets take a step back. The republicans were founded just to bring an end to slavery. Ok, thats not disputed. Right after the civil war the republicans lost the next 2 battles. Gun control and marriage licenses. Gun control to keep guns out of the hands of newly freed slaves and marriage licences-to keep blacks from marrying whites. Prior to that, marriage was purely a religious practice. Between the couple and their church. Their commitment to god.

 In 1916, maragret sanger founded planned parenthood. This is like the modern left's church today. Hillary Clinton calls Maragret Sanger her idol and role model. Its fitting because like Hillary, maragret was also a democrat, and like Hillary Maragret had a public and private position. Sanger believed in abortion whole heartedly. She thought that for the betterment of society the babies of the feeble minded and lower class should be aborted or plucked like ""weeds"" she like to refer to it as. That was her public position, but in private she just said retarded and minorities. 75% of Abortion clinics are located in minority communities today. Its estimated that 14 million black babies alone have been aborted ever since. Out of all the horrors the democrats have unleashed onto this country like jim crow, separate but equal, no blacks allowed, kkk, lynchings, firehoses and dogs, planned parenthood is the worst atrocity ever perpetrated on the black community. Democrats great society project redlined around the black communities and deemed them unfit for investment. Democrat LBJ's new deal kept blacks dependent on welfare for less than minimum wage, buying their votes. Which upon signing, as witnessed by 2 senators as saying ""we'll keep these ni**ers voting democrat for the next 200 years. These areas are now known as ghettos and have been democratically ran ever since. For 50, some even 70 years. To quote a democratic delegate by the name of Clemont Vallandingham out of ohio ""the civil war was a cruel and unnecessary war"". You see, democrats truly believed a freed slave wouldnt be able to feed themselves, cloth themselves or put a roof over their head. A kind of racism that still exist today. We republicans reject this kind of thinking. This is the same racist patronizing thing democrats do with voting ID laws. Claiming that black people cant afford or get ID's. That it suppresses black voters. You know, because apparently to democrats they just arent capable of handling such things. Surely they cant handle buying cigarettes or liquor or drive a car for that matter, either i guess. Because those things require ID. 
 Bill Clinton's 3 strikes laws locked up a generation of fathers. While hillary clinton calls young blacks ""superpredators"" and has been recorded saying they ""need to be brought to heel"". 

Now, who's the party that has abortions for sport?(Lena dunham anyone?) Who's the party for gun control? Whos the party telling you what size of fountain drink you can have? Whos the party trying to control how people speak? Who's the party still trying to dictate marriages? And if you dont follow their marriage laws theyll send an angry mob to your bakery with torches and pitchforks. Instead of hoods they were hoops in their ears and have blue hair and thick black glasses so you know they must be smart. 

And who's the freedom loving, pro life loving, gun toting, patriotic af party,  that just wants the government the hell out of peoples lives and to leave people the hell alone?

There were men and women and young (youngest 4 years) and old (in their 90's).  There were Native Americans and disabled,  and people from all walks of, and stages of, life- teachers and social workers and business owners and retired professionals and grocery store clerks. This is NOT an area full of people who are extreme (in beliefs or actions) in either direction. It is an area full of friends and neighbors who deeply care about each other and that was the prevailing spirit yesterday and that is the prevailing spirit all the time.

>no amount of public opinion has changed the situation to its logical conclusion: total war. 

That's a problem, don't you think? Because the American people want more war like they want a colonoscopy. They won't support it. And it's unlikely that allies would support that war. So the already exhausted troops face green Chinese troops. Conscription to support another war of choice? I don't think that's going to fly.

The debt to China is one of the bright spots. They really don't want to set that money on fire.

Yeah. Archaic as it is, and Mexicans running around digging tunnels and firing heavy calibre potato cannons - I don't think it would even require *official* forces to blow huge holes in it. That would give Mexico plausible deniability. But now you have to invade Mexico too.

"This to me is really telling of the great divide between how Christianity comes off to outsiders and how it really is from an insiders perspective. 

There is a lot of bad press because homosexuality (among literally almost everything else) is condemned by Christianity as ""a sin"". But what most outsiders **don't** understand (and television and movies are largely to blame for this I think) is that to a Christian, being ""a sinner"" does not mean ""you're a bad person"". Quite the contrary, in fact, because according to them we are all, by definition, sinners.

The very heart of the doctrine of Christianity is one of non-interventionism, acceptance and tolerance. There are many aspects of human behavior that are labelled as ""wrong in the eyes of god"" but that's never supposed to be used as a means to belittle or judge an individual.

Ex - Jesus said ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone"" - Explicitly meaning that nobody is perfect. We all do things that would be considered ""sins"" and therefore it's not our job, place or purpose to judge others.

Culturally, this is why places in the world where Christianity has been around for a long time as a cultural bedrock are **the only places in the world where you would actually want to live.** They are the only places that aren't totalitarian shitholes with no individual freedom or respect for equality / tolerance or any of the values we prize in western society today. 

People like to bash on Christianity and there are a lot of aspects of the ideology that I think are negative and toxic to an individual (self-hatred) but it's actually almost objectively wrong to suggest that the world isn't literally 100000 times over a better place today because of it.",UpliftingNews,1

"[Here's](http://www.aidsmap.com/Bone-marrow-transplantation/page/1729552/) a short explanation. 

Your [bone marrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow) produces red blood cells and lymphocytes (white blood cells that eat foreign stuff in your blood.) It is a large part of your immune system. HIV attacks the immune system in that HIV infects the cell types that your immune system is made up of. This means your bone marrow. 

HIV is a type of [retrovirus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus) Retroviruses can literally write their own RNA into the DNA of infected cells, lie dormant for a period of time, then instruct the cell to begin expressing the DNA again when conditions are more suitable to produce copies of themselves. This is why you can't just make something that finds the cells with HIV and kills them or remove the parts of you that are infected with HIV. *The virus is in the DNA of living cells disguised as normal cells that you need.* So, a good way to remove HIV is to replace the cells it infects with a transplant.

This is also why certain viruses (like HPV) can cause cancer - they mess around with the DNA in your cells which causes copying errors. Sometimes your immune system doesn't catch all the compromised cells, and some of those cells happen to have errors that instruct them to reproduce out of control. On an interesting note, the accuracy that is required to copy all the DNA in all of your cells when you are healthy is about 1 error in 10 billion copies! It's a miracle we all don't have cancer already. 

TL;DR HIV infects bone marrow cells and replacing it gets rid of the HIV while allowing you to not die from having no bone marrow at the same time.

"Actually the TVs put on sale on Black Friday aren't the TVs they sell the rest of the year. Walmart, Best Buy, and other big box stores work with Samsung, Sony, Visio etc to creat ""Black Friday Models"". They take the plastic shell their TVs are normally built into, and ship it to no-name Chinese factory in Shenzhen or Guangzhou. I'm not talking about Foxconn here, these are actual sweatshops in an unventilated warehouse with some tables and a wave solder machine.

They put in the cheapest panel they can find, the cheapest power supply and electronics, and the cheapest stand, and bolt it all together. Then they put the Sony or Samsung or Visio label on it, as well as a sticker with a model number that looks the same as a highly rated model, but with a few letters changed. It's basically an officially sanctioned knock-off. Then they ship it over to the US before Black Friday and advertize it as a 30% off sale--when in fact the TV cost less than half as much to manufacture compared to the regular models.

They get away with this because A) the model numbers are similar enough that most people won't notice, B) most people don't know how to tell a good picture from bad, and the floor models they see in the store have saturation and contrast set to max to make them look better, C) they typically have the minimum legally mandated 1yr warranty, so when 50% of them fail within 2 years they don't have to pay for replacements*, and D) people are less likely to get upset about a product breaking if they didn't spend as much on it.

The whole thing is a scam. TVs are the worst, but they also do it with laptops, tablets, AV equipment, etc. 

*Most people will respond to this with, ""Well I've had mine for x years and it's still working!"" That's to be expected; only a percentage of units die. Even with the crappiest products, 5-10% might last 10 years. It's also worth noting that this trend has only been happening the last 5-8 years or so, and only got really bad in the last 3 or 4.

"&gt;assume that all systems are the same

This is the most infuriating part of this comment thread. Everyone is basically going ""oh I learned after the Cecil killing that all trophy hunting is good so this is a bad move."" Species conservation is extremely complex and, as you said, varies from system to system. What works for one species in one country may fail for another species in another country. This is especially true in poor/unstable areas rife with corruption. People have been posting that Adam Ruins Everything video as well, but completely ignore the representative from the IUCN who notes that trophy hunting *can* be successful *if it is guided by conservation goals and occurs under strict scrutiny.* Skepticism of these programs is necessary, but lots of people in this thread are going the ""liberal pussies hate hunting"" route when it's more of a ""hey, let's make sure this is a sustainable program before we set the hunters loose.""",UpliftingNews,0

"My teacher didn't invite us, but we knew it was happening (one of our other teachers told us super secretly). He was everyones favourite teacher who had him (Grade 9 French Immersion), so we bribed our gym teacher to take our cash and drive off campus during lunch to buy decorations like streamers and little cheesy wedding things you stick on the wall, we got a big wedding-like arch from the drama room to put over his desk, and decorated his classroom. When he saw it, he broke down and started smiling like an idiot, which is a huge deal because he's known for being big and tough. it had to be one of the best moments of my life",UpliftingNews,0

Sad case in Dublin the other day, two elderly brothers found dead after neighbours raised the alarm when they hadn't been seen in a couple of weeks. Seems one was deaf and had difficulties and his brother was his carer. The carer passed away some weeks ago and seems the other man wasn't able to care for himself and was found dead also. My heart can't cope thinking about him alone and scared and literally starving to death while his brother lay there for weeks. Uuuuughhhhh I cannot cope. Befriend an elderly neighbour!!",UpliftingNews,0
The incentive is you get paid and have a job. If you don't like it then there are other people who would love to have that job. That's the same with just about any job out there. Very few people in this country are actually important to the business. We are all replaceable. Does that mean your employer can treat you like garbage? No. But I think it's reasonable for them to expect you to work on one of the busiest days/nights of the year. Every job has important/busy days and I would imagine most don't care what you have going on. Retails just happens to fall on a holiday. ,UpliftingNews,0

s. 37(1)
&gt;Every one is justified in using force to defend himself or any one under his protection from assault, if he uses no more force than is necessary to prevent the assault or the repetition of it.

...as long as the force used is no more than necessary

s. 34(1)
&gt;Every one who is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is justified in repelling force by force if the force he uses is not intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable him to defend himself.

In reference to your:
&gt;...charged for assault while fending off burglars in their own homes...

There are two important things to consider: 1) The charges likely wouldn't stick (Crown has a very specific set of things it needs to prove) and 2) if they did stick, there's likely a reason for it. Also note, if the charges stick, it still has to go to court.

Obligatory: IANAL",UpliftingNews,0
