Why would he want to one and done it when he has lived more than half his life (presumably). So someone can come along and fuck it up?",gameofthrones,1

You are on point I am almost certain she will become just as mad as the mad king. In the books she burns down the tower of the hand and it  is implied she gets sexually aroused just like the mad king did. I like Jamie being the in who kills Cersei. Jamie is probably one of the most important characters especially for the end of the series.  He is on the path of redemption and he will become the head of the Lannister army which Jon can use. I have a feeling he will be a hero in the end.,gameofthrones,1

"The issue is that we aren't used to seeing such graphic nudity and sex scenes in TV. When you're not used to seeing it, it REALLY stands out.  But there's really not that much.  I saw a site where someone crunched the numbers, and in the first 4 seasons, 40 hours of show, there's 30 minutes of sex & nudity. Most scenes of sex/nudity are less than a minute. That's 1.25% of the show.  It just *seems* like a lot because you're not used to seeing it in TV shows.

It's honestly not that distracting if you've ever seen naked people before.  There's usually important plot points or character development going on during those scenes and if you're not seeing it, you're paying too much attention to the wrong things.",gameofthrones,1

"I do just wanna point out a few things:

Starks are pretty much raised learning how to rule. Remember the first episode? Ned has (bran? Robb?) learn about stark honor and that a man who executes does it himself. If Starks, who are supposed to be the premier northmen do it, the others probably do too. At least the more honorable houses.

Tommen is...retarded. Not like, figuratively. In the books he's described as being ""slow"" more than a few times. Considering he's an incest baby, that's not a surprise. 

Tommen, even if he wasn't mentally ill, hasn't been raised to rule at ALL. The Lannisters and Baratheons are really rich and powerful, and the children got what the want when they want. That's why Geoffry is such a cunt and Mycella is so naively romantic. They haven't seen the real world outside of shelter, and the few times Geoffry did see that even though he was king he wasn't immortal, he almost shit himself. Black fire, the peasant revolt, his own demise. 

And...cersei. Then only one who taught the children how to play the game is one of the WORST players of the game. Just last week cersei tried to play the game, and threw away her wildcard like a dumbass. Instead of going to see the sparrow, she let her emotional revenge win and let all the sparrows know that the mountain is immortal. Which makes them ban trial by Combat. And this is the woman who taught her children how to rule. She's a stupid cunt! She has no idea what she's doing! ",gameofthrones,1

">Every one of these predictions where people think his ability is so interactive literally kills years of character development. They are not going to do that.

GRRM and D&D don't care about your character development. They have no problem killing characters you care about. In other words, if you think this has a heppy ending, you haven't been paying attention. The story thrives on bitter but compelling twists and Bran's ability as a greenseer is one of these twists that is going to tie many of the series' happenings together. You're right that Bran probably won't warg into anybody anymore, I think he will warg into dead Jon though. A dead man can't be screwed up like how he screwed up Hodor. You are wrong that this scene isn't important and Bran warging back in time won't be relevant. It is a huge precedent and will be very important. If you are interested, I can go in to more detail but I won't waste time talking about it more if you are going to be so dismissive.",gameofthrones,1

">Dany is the bad guy, she is nuts, and the Anakin Skywalker of this story, for whatever reason the show has been terrible at getting this across like the books, so all the way back to season 1, someone being a Dany fan was obvious that they haven't read the books.

Dany as mad and villain is the number one hope of Dany haters, some of them want it so much, they went ahead and convinced themselves that it is already true and anyone who disagrees is a retard in denial. 

The truth is, Dany is one of the main characters in this story, one who will be extremely important in the end game and will probably turn the tables on all the westerosi characters people know and care. 

All this talk of how her part doesn't matter and/or boring is actually people projecting their fear about westeros onto Dany. Because if she comes down with a massive army and three dragons to westeros, none of the ""mind games"", and plots or characters will matter. They will all be swept by her. We are actually watching two ticking time bombs that will render all the games played in westeros   moot. And while the ""white walker time bomb"" promises an epic, magical fight, ""Dany time bomb"" is an anticlimactic ending to all political games. 

And that's the core of it really. People care about westeros and want to see things about westeros. The more Dany drags in Essos, the less interested they are, but the more she drags there they also see westeros only grows weaker for her to take as she inevitably grows stronger. Starting with season 5, things went to stall, where westeros slowly falls apart as she figures how to rule and chose how to handle problems. It's almost like game is rigged in her favor and we have been duped to love and care for the westerosi characters.",gameofthrones,1

Dany and Jon ruling together seems a given considering they'll end up sleeping together in this season coming. Plus there's got to be some meaning to the title, ice and fire. 

Arya might die, don't know how but I have a feeling she'll die defending someone or be sacrificed by Jon unknowingly.

Sansa may become ruler of Winterfell.

Bran, I feel, is gonna become one of the dragon riders. He'll help Dany regain Viserion by warging into him thus fulfilling the ""Bran will fly"" prediction. He may end up becoming Viserion permanently.

Tyrion will become hand of Dany and Jon.

The Hound will probably die in a showdown between him and Mountain, ocestrated by Cersei accusing him of betraying Joffrey by deserting blackwater and ordering the mountain to execute him.

Littlefinger is definitely going to be executed by Arya and the starks will learn Ned died because of him. Also Sansa will probably reveal he killed Lysa and it'll come out that Robyn is his illegitimate son.

Varys will still be master of spies. 

Brienne will be made commander of Dany and Jons kingsguard. 

We know Jamie will abandon Cersei and head north. He may likely join the fight against the white walkers and die defending the wall OR die defending Bran.

Cersei will die most likely by Tyrion's hand. 

Sam will become a maester of the Nights watch if it remains. I'm betting the ww won't all be wiped up. Gilly and baby Sam will go with him. 

Jorah will become lord commander of the nights watch.

Davos... I'm not sure. I think he'll be given some sort of honour by Jon.

Theon will die. From what I read he abandons Yara who gets captured by Euron so that reformation hasn't worked out. Typical.

That's all I have so far. ",gameofthrones,1

Mostly, yes. It was left ambiguous the way he ""died"", just like The Hound. We don't see Brienne giving him the fatal blow, leaving a possibility that Stannis could somehow manage to have lived. That's what the series creators intended to do in my opinion. Letting Stannis live is a worse punishment than being dead, and Brienne could have easily thought that. He lost everything and now he has to live with it for the rest of his life.

Then The Mountain can rape her last, which will probably result in her death. Jamie is forced to watch, tied up and someone jerking him off to it while he watches and can't do anything about it. Then kill him afterwards. Tyrion can go out with a bang, riding a dragon into Westeros till he gets shot with an arrow to the knee and falls off the dragon from high up in the sky, but drinking a cup of wine on his way down like a motherfuckin boss. He gets to go out in such a badass way. The white walker army will take many numbers, but they will be stomped by Dany's dragons and a mass production of Valerian steel swords, ships and canons.

""Bernie and his supporters (I include myself) tend to assume that much of the money-changing that goes on adds nothing to the American economy, that it makes some people rich, and that those people are basically ( redundant word) a major drain on the rest of us.

A plumber fixes pipes, a teacher ( missing comma) helps kids learn, somebody who works in a grocery store keeps the system that gets food to us going, so what the hell do you do? We think, nothing useful.
We make this assumption to some degree out of ignorance - e.g. I have no idea what you mean by ""capital markets"" and neither do your 16 downvoters. ""capital"" would be, what... something to do with ( missing article) money? and(conjunction at the start of a sentence) ""markets"" would be something to do with the stock exchange?
TLDR: There's a lot of ( vague, informal writing

""Many (not all) of America's troubles come from the way the system currently works, which is that the wealthy have a great deal of control over the government through campaign contributions, ( no comma needed)  and the media. They use this influence to advance their own ( redundant word) particular interests, without regard to the interests of others (as people with power will do), which necessarily causes problems for the rest of us. Bernie Sanders is, in my view, the one running for president who is the most committed to (and capable of) making changes to the system in order to ( wordiness) diminish said influence. Actually, ( redundant word)  I would suggest he's ( informal writing)  the only one running for president in the last quarter-century at least who has been so committed to that end.

Littlefinger hasn't exerted his political capital yet. He hasn't gone around saying ""I won the fight Jon is useless"". Presumably neither have the knights of the vale. Littlefinger is holding onto that card for now.

So what is the north going to think? A son of Eddard Stark takes back Winterfell. He's a hero. Without serious reason they're going to assume the victory was theirs. The idea of strong north men triumphing against unbeatable odds plays right to their pride.

And what about the vale? They're sworn to Winterfell, so their army was Jon's army as far as anyone in the north is concerned.

And what about him being a bastard? Ned's other sons are all dead. Jon is a son and the eldest. He took back Winterfell and wants to go hold the wall. He's much like Ned and he's everything they want. If they're brazen enough to declare a King in the North then I doubt they care about some Southern laws regarding bastard inheritance.",gameofthrones,1

In the books, for example, we know he loves to hunt women in the woods, catch them, rape them, kill them, then let the original Reek have sex with the corpse. While Ramsay probably got some perverse pleasure from watching original reek do that, we don't have any reason to believe he had any interest in necrophilia. I would say the same goes for Bestiality.

Here's an example from 1977 by danish painter Niels Strøbæk.
It's a portrait of Queen Margrethe II.
Her face itself is not particular realistic and probably done in a more classic style similar to traditional portraits of royals on purpose, but notice the frame. It's not actually a mirror.

"I think it can be hard to kill off characters who you've grown attached to over the years, but any writer who actually dislikes one of their characters enough to take some vindictive pleasure from doing something horrible to them is, in my opinion, a bad writer. I think what a lot of people forget about writers is that they don't engage with their creation like the people who consume it, they don't get invested and involved in the characters themselves, they get invested in telling the story they want to and seeing it through. I think it can be much more satisfying to see a tragic arc like Cersei's all the way through, and see a truly good person like Davos sent through hell and back because of their unwillingness to waver in their convictions, because in the end you achieve what you wanted to achieve in the first place: telling a cautionary tale about the tragic reality of the human condition, as you perceive it. 

Characters aren't people, they're arcs: representation of our virtues and vices playing out our reality on the stage where everyone can see them. When one meets its inevitable fate at the hands of another, there is more to be gained from using that moment to reflect upon our own lives in reality than there is to be gained from keeping a fake person ""alive.""

I hope that made sense, TL;DR Writers don't care about the characters for who they are, they care about what they represent, and seeing those representations of your interpretation of reality through is more important than keeping an imaginary person ""alive"" for a little longer.

Edit: I should also add that this is just my opinion and all writers engage with their own creation in different ways, and yes I believe even if you intend to kill a character off for their sins, you can still really connect to them and feel great sadness when doing so. The way I wrote the original post made it sound like I didn't think writers felt any real emotion for their characters, which isn't accurate.",gameofthrones,0

"Yes, obviously GRRM has been involved intimately in the show. But what is also obvious is that GRRM respects the basics of storytelling. It would be *bad* storytelling to have something occur on the show that can only be explained if the audience has read the books. Everything the audience needs to understand the plot and characters on the show should be accessible by watching the show alone. Homework should never be a prerequisite for understanding what should be a self-contained narrative. Clearly the show and books deal with the same characters and events, but nonetheless they have to be treated as separate texts to a certain extent.

The conversation where Robert told Cersei that Bran should be put out of his misery did not happen on the show. Furthermore, show Joffrey never really demonstrated that he was all that interested in impressing Robert. Meanwhile there is loads of evidence that Littlefinger is a consummate manipulator who set in motion the entire feud between House Stark and Lannister.

Fixed timeline time-travel means everything is preordained and time doesn't follow a linear path because the future has to have been conceived at the same time as the present in order for it to loop back on itself. Though it does make for a cool storyline, the character literally has no effect on the world because the effects he does have, had to happen for the linear timeline to exist and therefore there was never an alternative outcome in the first place.

The french army started to shadow them, by then the men were starving cause the king ordered them not to pillage villages but pay for food if the could(something most other commanders.of the 100 years war would Not have done). The french forced them into battle between the villages of drincourt and azincourt.

 A good book about the english campaign in france in 1415 is Agincourt by Juliet Barker, this campaign is one of the earliest were we  have the English governments paper work for before and after the campaign. We know which lords bought x amount of arrows for the royal armories, how many men each lord was contracted by the exchequer to provide, their are suriviving lists of some of the lords retiunues which means we have a good deal names of the common soldiers and what did on the battlefield. 

Example Sir William Bourchier( husband of one of the kings cousins)brought 90 mounted Archers(who would dismount for Battle as The longbow is too big to use on horseback) and 29 men at arms(which would.include knights, sergants, and the older squires).

Sorry for the rant, the hundred years war and the following english civil war called the war of the roses are a passion of mine.

"Arya has a lot of Queen references hidden throughout her stiry. Very careful and methodical readers have found many of them. But GRRM goes farther, embedding clues and callbacks to Arya and other Kings and Queens. 

&gt;Jon gathers Northmen to march to War in Arya Stark’s name. I love the fact that House Flint are among the Northmen marching. Arya is named after **Arya Flint**, Ned’s grandmother. The Flints were former **Kings of Winter** before the Starks and have the blood of the First Men. Arya’s name literally means **“Nobility”**.

- GRRM harks back to **Aegon the Unlikely** to Arya Stark as shown here: https://m.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4s62h0/everything_arya_the_unlikely_daughter_of_the_north/

- Arya told her father she wanted to be a King’s Councillor and build Castles. What other Queen does she resemble who did just that? **Good Queen Alysanne Targaryen**: http://maisiestyle.tumblr.com/post/148816486945/its-just-so-interesting-looking-back-on-what-arya

- Arya is fond of Aegon the Conqueror and most importantly his two sisters. If we look closer, **Arya and Rhaeyns** share many similarities: http://maisiestyle.tumblr.com/post/151203052665/arya-rhaeyns-a-starktargaryen-analysis-part

- Where does Arya stand with Robb's Will? GRRM said the Will is going to play an important role. Obviously with the 5 witnesses still alive. Lady Stoneheart moved the Brotherhood's HQ from the Hollow Hill to the Saltpans. Why would she do that? Because the Saltpans was the last place Arya was seen alive. She has the Brotherhood searching for her, LS is questioning prisoners and looking for orphan children in the hopes that Arya might be among them. **The Hooded Man** at Winterfell could've have been one of her spies, Harwin maybe? Checking to see if it was really Arya in Winterfell. Another interesting note is that Lady Stoneheart stopped Brienne's mission of finding Sansa and gave her a new mission of getting Jaime instead. And before that, the trail Brienne was on lead her closer to Arya Stark in the first place.

This scene is when Meribald tells Brienne about Arya:

&gt;""Your Dornishman did not lie,"" the Elder Brother began, ""but I fear you did not understand him. **You are chasing the wrong wolf, my lady. Eddard Stark had two daughters. It was the other one that Sandor Clegane made off with, the younger one.""**

&gt;""Arya Stark?"" Brienne stared open-mouthed, astonished. ""You know this? Lady Sansa's sister is alive?""

&gt;""Then,"" said the Elder Brother. ""Now . . . I do not know. She may have been amongst the children slain at Saltpans.""

We know Arya got on the ship to Braavos before Rorge arrived and massacred the place. He wore The Hound's helm and everyone is blaming him for the attack.

With Robb thinking Arya is missing and therefore assumed dead... Why does GRRM omit her at the Will's sealing when Robb names his dead siblings and disinherits Sansa? Purposely ambiguous with Arya and Jon.... makes you wonder why?

- Varys speech was GRRM speaking through his character, it doesn't fit fAegon at all. When you swap in Arya's name, GRRM has had her do all these random things mentioned by Varys:

http://maisiestyle.tumblr.com/post/151308481625/rosedustfever-she-is-here-arya-has-been

She is the only Stark to name her direwolf after a real person. Arya takes the name Nymeria while at Harrenhal. She tells the Kindly Man her cover story for Cat of the Canals, she arrived to Braavos on a ship called *Nymeria*. 

&gt;""You play at being a servant, **but in your heart you are a lord's daughter**. You have taken other names, but you wore them as lightly as you might wear a gown. **Under them was always Arya.**""

Arya will take on a role but underneath she will always be Arya Stark. That is her bittersweet ending, to live a life she never wanted, serving her house and Raelm as Queen.",gameofthrones,0

"You seem to be projecting, because there are heros and villains, theyre just shown truthfully, every hero has darker sides to their character, just like every villain has some decent aspects. This whole ideology is reflected in game of thrones, the heros aren't the same ""noble men of bravery"" we've been shown in media for years. Game of thrones reflects life with fantasy included, it shows that shitty things happen in the world, but good things can come of them, it also gives deep 3-dimensional characters that are interesting enough to become invested in. Take Daenerys for example, you have a young woman ( 13 at the start of the books), that has been on the run her whole life, with no family but an abusive older brother. She is sold to Drogo, whom she learns to love, and then he dies, and after he is burned, she and her dragons (literally) rise from the ashes, gather an army, free slaves, and help the common people. the world of ice and fire is definitely not as bad as you make it out to be.

Game of thrones is an epic story about an entire new fantasy world. So what if lots of people die? Its not like they are murdering the cast for shock value. There are characters from season1 who are alive in season7 and have never crossed paths. That's how big the world is.

"The way the books describes warging is kind of like filling a glass. The glass is the mind, the water inside the glass is the personality or ""soul"" filling the glass. Animals are easy to warg into because their ""glass"" isn't full, which leaves room for ""another"" to help fill the glass. It also becomes easier and easier with the same animal as the warg and said animal develop a sort of connection. Which means that when Bran ""fills the glass"" he also probably stretches it a bit allowing for easier connections later.

But with a human their ""glass"" is completely full. A warg can't take over a human because there simply isn't enough ""room"". Hodor is a simpleton however, who mentally isn't a ""whole"" person. His mental handicap is probably similar to how animals are less intelligent than humans. This lack of personality and will creates an empty space in Hodor's ""glass"" allowing Bran to warg into Hodor because there is room.

I believe this means Bran can't warg into humans, or at least any regular human who's glass is ""full"".

So what does this mean for wights? Hard to say. You could argue that because the soul of the human vacated the body, it's an empty glass waiting to be filled by a warg like Bran. But wait! 

If the wights are empty human vessels without souls (dead bodies) then how are the reanimated? My theory? Because the Night's King is *mass warging* into all the wights creating a sort of hive mind with him as the head of the proverbial snake. This would also explain why Bran probably can't warg into a wight. A wight is already a filled vessel, filled with the essence of the Night's King, who is actively warging into *all* the wights at a given time. It explains how they all are able to act as a group despite no clear lines of communication, and how the Night King's magic works.

The White Walkers magic is clearly connected to the same magic as the Children of the Forest. The Night's King was able to see Bran during his warging session that lead to him being touched so it's not far fetched to consider the Night King is also a warg. We also have seen that the Night's King was able to bring back an entire field of dead wildlings in the span of a few seconds and simultaneously control their actions just by raising his hands. He simply extended his ""mass warg"" spell into the nearby bodies, had them all rise ominously, and give Jon Snow the ""Come at me bro"" look. 

On top of that it would make sense why the Wights are all ""zombies"" with a bit of direction. They are mostly mindless unthinking drones but they do have clear purposes in mind when they are directed to attack a position or whatever. This would lend credence to my theory. It's probably quite difficult to warg some thousand dead bodies at the same time. They can't all be controlled intelligently like a regular human, so they kind of get put into this passive ""standby"" mode with a few basic commands from the Night's King without getting overly specific because it's too difficult for him to exert that much will over so many subjects.

Another hint at this is the eyes. Wargs have the ""white eye"" when warging, as does the creature they warg into. This seems to only be temporary in the ""vessel"" but all the wargs we've seen maintain this ""white eye"" look throughout the duration of the warging. Even the three eyed raven. Meanwhile Wights have been noted multiple times to have eyes as blue as the sky upon reanimated. This is without fail. If the Night's King is ""mass warging"" into the Wights, it would make sense that this presents itself as blue eyes like ice.

Furthermore, take a look at Coldhands. In the show he just looks like Benjen but in the books his eyes are described as ""black in contrast to the wights and others."" It's pretty clear that Coldhands is a wight who is somehow free of the Nights King's control and is not mindless like the other wights. If he's a wight just like the others why are his eyes black and not blue? Because he's not being warged into by the Night's King.

tl;dr Bran can't warg into wights because they are already being mass warged by the Night's King.",gameofthrones,0
"While i do like a lot of the casting for the roles on the show,especially tywin.They really did a disservice to alot of the characters in there appearances and there story arcs.

Basically in the show all u see is loras being moody and in gay scenes.In the books its hinted at but never explored fully.But you see his love/belief in renly and by all accounts he is the finest jouster in the realm and arrogant and a bit of a hothead.

Its one of the reasons the tyrells assassinate joffrey because they know eventually he will mistreat margarey and loras would kill him for it.",gameofthrones,0

"Technically Jon is not a Stark, and Sansa has already served her house by being the catalyst for Ramsay killing Roose, for convincing Jon to march south to retake Winterfell, and for bringing the Knights of the Vale and winning the battle.

Since there's a close to 100% chance the show skips Mya Stone, and there's a 100% chance the show has skipped Edric Storm, then obviously it's possible. For me it'd be the most surprising moment of the series if he did come back and become a high lord tho.",gameofthrones,0

"&gt; You think Joffrey turned out cruel because Cersei was a bad mother?

Yes, obviously.

&gt; Guys come on you should know better. He was cruel because he came out of incest. It's known that Targaryen babies have a 50% chance of becoming cruel.

That's not something that's ""known""; that's something that some people believe in-universe. Like how lots of people believe in-universe that Tyrion is evil and responsible for Joffrey's murder. The truth is that a) the Targaryens didn't always practice incest and b) no one knows for sure what drove the mad Targaryens mad. Mad Aerys, for example, was kidnapped by the Duskendales and possibly raped.

&gt; Incest is bad for babies. Nothing to do how they are raised. It sounds silly yes but it work's out well. Danny's father and two brother were what? Cruel. Exactly.

Rhaegar wasn't cruel. Literally no one other than Robert Baratheon is shown to think ill of Rhaegar. As for Viserys - his life was a series of humiliations and hardships. It's not hard to imagine how he became a cruel person, though it certainly doesn't justify anything he did.",gameofthrones,0
