Was it previously on the AppStore? You could always try looking on Appcake.,jailbreak,1
"It drove me crazy not having the ipa's anymore on my computer when making a backup.

Finally found a more or less easy solution:

Install Appcake go into settings -> app management

Click on an app and choose ""export ipa""

Files are saved /var/mobile/Media/Appcake//Imported

Haven't tried restoring such an ipa via iTunes but I imagine should be ok as the ipa isn't cracked just backed up.

Hope this helps

Someone help pleASE Can't find an answer anywhere else. I keep trying to make a post but the auto mod is busting my balls and keeps removing it and IDK why I don't use Reddit a lot. I just jailbroke my iPhone 6 on iOS 9.1 with the pangu for 9 and 9.1. I tried downloading a couple games and an emulator but none of them work? They just crash as soon as I try to open them. They are on my phone but when I press the icon it opens for a second and then crashes. Anyone know what's going on here? I am new to this stuff so I really have no idea what's going on and I'm getting very frustrated because I can't get anything to work.,jailbreak,1

"For a superior being you don't understand some shit. For one, as a superior being you seem to think inferior beings have the capacity to identify you as a superior being. They don't. They can't tell by looking at you, nor can they tell if you know what you are talking about. If they were smart enough to identify you as a superior being they'd be smart enough to know what they are fucking talking about. They don't.
Two, only a moron goes to an Apple Store with a hardware issue with a jailbreak still installed. What are the chances you are going to be dealing with a superior being? Maybe 1 in 10 at best. By leaving the jailbreak on you not only gave inferior beings a free ticket to deny you, you mandated them to deny you. It's like going to a movie theater with a candy bar in your pocket. The ticket taker doesn't give a fuck that he sees a bulge in your pocket. He knows it's not your dick, he's been working his job a long time. He just needs plausible deniability so he can ignore it. But when you walk up to the ticket taker with a candy bar in your other hand the ticket taker has to say 'Sorry, you can't bring that in here.' He has no plausible deniability.
When you take a jailbroken iPhone with a hardware problem to an apple store you are not allowing the similarly moronic inferior being to have plausible deniability. He is then forced to call you out on it.
As a superior being you need to step it up and become a high functioning superior being, not this half-baked, 'If I said it and I'm right that's all that should matter' piece of shit version of a superior being.
Hope that helped.",jailbreak,1

&gt; Apple used a password-protection algorithm in iOS 10 known as PBKDF2 instead of the alternative known as SHA256 that it employed in iOS 9

SHA256 is not really an alternative to PBKDF2.

SHA256 is a cryptographic hash function.

PBKDF2 is a Password-Based Key Derivation Function that typically USES a cryptographic hash function.

&gt; PBKDF2 applies a pseudorandom function, such as a cryptographic hash, cipher, or hash-based message authentication code (HMAC), to the input password or passphrase along with a salt value and repeats the process many times to produce a derived key, which can then be used as a cryptographic key in subsequent operations. The added computational work makes password cracking much more difficult, and is known as key stretching.

"I assume you have a 16gb device. Coolstars stashing tweak is pretty much essential for 16gb, and almost so for 32gb devices. Hell, I have a 64gb phone and I had to install it since I'm a fairly heavy user. 

It's normal for 16gb devices to have around 70mb free from a fresh restore and jailbreak. 

Cydia Eraser repairs destroyed/modified system files, downloads removed files to replace, and in the final stage deletes all user data and runs the native ""erase all contents and settings."" So by design, it very well should restore your system partition to stock. If it didn't touch your system partition, it wouldn't remove Cydia, and your jailbreak itself. 

Have you installed Filza after a fresh Erase and actually observed old files and such? Also, generally speaking, just having files laying around isn't going to impact battery. If they're completely orphaned files from being jailbreak, nothing will try to access them. Make tweaks fuck up? Potentially. The biggest cause for this would be old preferences, but those are almost always stored in the user partition, so they would be wiped even if Eraser didn't reset the system partition. There could be other situations in which old files might mess up your tweaks, but not too common. ",jailbreak,0

I had noticed that the suppression from Spotlight is basically not functional (works after respring, but not good enough), but I didn't test with alternate switchers, so that doesn't surprise me.

I will pop my SIM into the 5s tomorrow and do some more robust notification testing, but it didn't look like too much changed between iOS 8 and 9 on the notification front.  I think I only tested an alarm from the lock screen, and it was suppressed.

This is really helpful feedback though.  The phone on 8.x isn't my daily driver, but I will use it tomorrow and get to work fixing what I catch.

Edit:  Just to be clear, turning Show Notifications off does not hide old notifications from NC, it only suppresses incoming ones.  Did you mean that new notifications still show, or only that old ones weren't hidden?  Not a bad idea though, regardless.",jailbreak,0

You can change the amount of blur eg light medium or dark blur ,jailbreak,0
"i really dont give 1 hoot about jailbreaking anymore. 
I just want my phone to text, email, and call. As long as it does that im ok with it. 

Its up to you to value the jailbreak or not. ",jailbreak,0
Just put a space instead of text,jailbreak,0
