SPOILER

This post has been edited I was told my guess was spot one so I add a spoiler warning but hope you enjoy

I was talking with a friend about rem and what we thought would happen to her , I think that thay will not kill her off but do something to her like put her in a coma than we stared talking about some stuff I have been working on and was going over the plot and I was point out thay may make it so he only remember her than try's to kill him self but his save point might change and we did so more thlking I think this is what I think will happen . All so it's imposble for mc to stop the cult by him salf so he will need help so the kights will help and also can some one tale me the pricess candidate The green haired one that the mc is stating with in the op she is warring armor and fighting so I think she will fight the Whale and maybe the whale has some kind of ability to make people not exist and that's what happen becomes I would think thay would kill off some the kights or maybe another one of the sin dudes can do that that's what happen if you guys have any thoughts on my theory please say so I hope this what happen it would a good anime if so this anime is already one of my favorite",anime,1

"i'm miffed because it characterized beatrice, tanaka, and the world really fast. We know Beatrice is super strong. Tanaka stands there and gets clocked. Its not a small hit, She freaking ragdolls. BUT THEN SHE GETS BACK UP. This random, weird ass girl we just met apparently has the strength to just take the full brunt of Beatrice's berserker install, who was easily able to overpower Miyu and Illya with Ruby and Sapphire. 
On top of Tanaka and Beatrice being obscenely strong, Illya is fairly weak at this point, she's alone, not knowing where she is, etc. It makes the whole scene feel like a godzilla movie where tanaka and beatrice are kaiju and illya is a human caught in the onslaught. It also makes the line where Tanaka happily says she needs to destroy the Ainsworth mean something because we know she has the power to do so.",anime,1

"Not sure if you know this, but the word ""trap"" is really, really offensive to trans* folks like myself. It's a derogatory slur that implies trans* folks, especially transwomen, are ""deceiving"" people for sex, and that to have sex with a trans* person is to be fooled. The reason that this is dehumanizing is for a number of reasons, the first of which is that it's very disrespectful of trans* people's gender identities, that it to say, it partially if not fully buys into the narrative that trans* people are ""dressing up"" like their preferred gender, and are not actually ""real"". Furthermore, it implies deception, which is not true. Because we *are* out preferred gender, there is no deception--to say otherwise would be very transphobic as it invalidates one's gender identity.

We start off with another OP skip so you know shit is gonna go down again and boy, did shit go down. Start off with Biki, Tsubasa, and Chris showing off their X-Drives and destroying that mob of Noise. Then we move to Fine merging with Durandal and we have a villain with regenerative powers and destructive force, but Tsubasa and Chris don't give a shit and maneuver their way inside to get Durandal to Biki. Biki almost loses herself to her berserk mode again, but with the help of everyone, she's able to control herself for a slash. 

Biki just wouldn't be Biki if she straight up killed Fine. She still wanted to understand and befriend Fine and she left it up to Fine to unite the future as Biki protects the present. I liked the messages/lessons that Tsubasa and Chris left. It's important to have dreams, but it's also important to strive for a future that allows the chance for successful dreams. Your life isn't just defined by what you do, it's also defined by what you leave behind for he future. And then the mad (wo)men go blow up (part of) the moon! And they are alive!

"Didn't he have that PTSD though? His loved one's did die, but as long as he had the confidence that he could return by death and save them, it didn't break him. Similarily, Okabe only fully broke when he came to the realisation that he couldn't save Mayushii. The fact that they initially cope differently with the deaths isn't all that unbelievable, imo. In fact, it wouldn't be unreasonable for a character with a fitting characterisation to not break at all, but neither Subaru not Okabe were such characters. [I only know the story of the original visual novel, not anything else that might be relevant here]

When Rem snapped him out of his PTSD, he was able to power through the rest because he had clear goal that he put his mental resources towards. He simply couldn't afford to be held back by being overloaded with stress. He probably wasn't completely freed, but it's certainly possible to force it into the background while working towards another goal.

As for his behaviour in episode 13, that was exactly because he didn't actually love Emilia at that point. He had a crush on her and Emilia didn't fit the expectiations he had about her, so he tried to force her into those expectations and wasn't able to accept it when she called him out on it.",anime,1

He develops a strange love hate relationship with Japan, like giving Rin shit for being Japanese, but also turning Archibald's Volumen Hydrargyrum into a moe as fuck maid. 

He stays at the academy mostly, being involved somewhat in pretty much any story that goes there during his time period (he has a cameo at the start of Fate/Apocrypha for example), though he most notable is probably his appearance in the F/sn UBW epilogue, which was written especially for the anime.

Finally, in the UBW timeline, he and Rin team up and battle other mages in an attempt to destroy the Greater Grail for good, a war which is described to have been in he same scope as a Holy Grail War."" )

"Well, I can only speak about my personal views, but I didn't find the things you mentioned to be all that aggravating. A bit annoying, yes, but she grew out of them later, which makes me more forgiving.

And frankly, when she was ""badmouthing"" Simon to Kamina in episode 3, if I were in her place, I'd probably have said the same thing. Looking at Simon's character up to that point, what it seems is happening is Kamina is handing Simon the Lagann purely out of favoritism, which is not smart and would probably end up getting people dead. Of course, we the audience (and Kamina) know what kind of a show TTGL is and that Simon does have what it takes, but that's knowledge Yoko didn't have at that point.

If there were any complaints I had about her, it'd be that I wish she'd got a bit more character development (I'm happy that she got what she did, but it'd be nice if she had more). Especially [Late show spoilers](/s ""her thing with Kittan near the end""), that kind of came out of nowhere. And that I find her early character, especially her interactions with Kamina, to be somewhat bitchy (I don't like tsunderes very much... it's rare that I find one I consider well-written and likable).",anime,1

It's a neat mechanic for a show that makes it like a video game with spawn points, but considering how often he fails or makes things worse while slowly losing it, it's pretty far from being a plot armor.

I don't think just any form of plot progression is an accomplishment, for that reason i'd say Fate/Zero's first episode accomplishes much more than Cross Game's first episode in spite of the fact that someone *fucking dies* in the first episode of Cross Game. 

Because I think the way Cross Game handles that character is that they use her as little more than a plot device. Later on in the series they decide to even introduce [Cross Game](/s ""a completely unrelated look-alike for the sake of drama and character development."") This is opposed to Fate/Zero's first episode which is solely for establishing character relations, ideologies, and motivations in a way that allows the rest of the drama and plot to play out naturally. It's a matter of preference of course, and some might not see Cross Game that way (I can sympathize with that since I love Clannad despite similar complaints levied against that).

You have considerable unused capacity that you have not turned to your advantage. Disciplined and self-controlled on the outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure on the inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You also pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others' statements without satisfactory proof. But you have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you are extroverted, affable, and sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, and reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be rather unrealistic.",anime,1

Let me clarify, I know that art also includes the disgusting, the decrepit and immoral and are viewed as interesting, but let's be real here, there is nothing likeable about the characters, it's not like finding a diamond in a pile of trash nor the enjoyment that one would find in an anime like Death Note where the anti hero meets his well deserved end and balance is restored in the world.

"Edgy is not a word with much meaning, it can be just having character dressed in black and red or it can be a mean comment about a tragedy.

Anyway, I will take two cases from the same author, Takahiro. (Majikoi, Kimiaru, Akame ga Kill!, Yuki Yuna/Washio Sumi/Nogi Wakaba is a Hero, among others)

In one of his series, half of the cast died, and people call it edgy. In another one, half of the cast died, and people don't call it edgy at all. 

What makes the difference? I think the clear one would be the amount and circumstances of death. Jumping in front of an attack to save a friend is magnitudes less ""edgy"" than having a mother/daughter raped and murdered in front of the husband/father's grave.

But that aside, there is also the reminiscence factor, in the ""non-edgy"" series you don't have only the shock of death, but also the solemnity of the moments that follow it. Things like funeral rites, introspections, nostalgia as chapters later the character still feels the tangible missing spot that the deceased person left.

Shock factor, perhaps, is the keyword of this all.

Anyway, it is not like there is nothing inherently wrong with being ""edgy"". It is often seen as negative, just like greasy food and soda is seen as unhealthy, but people still consume it anyway, because sometimes you just want that experience in particular.",anime,1

"Apologies to my fellow first-time watchers. Specifically the ones who didn't know that last episode's preview was pretty much bullshit. As I mentioned in my spoiler tag last thread, I was accidentally spoiled about that before I started watching Katanagatari, so I thought that I'd fuck with you guys for a bit by hyping up the fight. :p

And Shichika and Togame talking about their fight at the end of the episode made the audience-fuckery that much better.

But with that being said, even if we didn't see any jumping sharks get sliced in half, I personally thought that this is the best episode so far. While Shichika's coldness was commented on in the last episode, seeing Nanama be even more cold-hearted (and enjoying her massacre of the Maniwani to an extent as well) took me by surprise. I'm hoping that we see more of her later on because she might end up being one of the, if not the most interesting character in the end IMO. But for now I guess that we'll be seeing more of just Shichika's and Togame's exploits for a while (unless we get another bullshit preview, though I doubt that the series will pull that trick again).",anime,0

Also you forgot the entire SAO story is already written in a WN before the first volume hits, so it wasn't that there's a limit to it, it just he sucked at writing back then. Now he's good.

"Ah I just posted a comment referencing your review, I think the ""shitstorm"" was mostly because of the wording. The narrative structure itself is open to criticism, not everyone is going to like/dislike how the story presents itself, but focusing on what wasn't answered and what wasn't concluded was where I think most of the opposition was involved. 

Since we know it's an ongoing story we can assume its just setting up for future plot points. I haven't even read the source, I just know it's a larger story and don't fault the adaptation for not concluding stuff it couldn't conclude without going anime original.

As for calling it incomplete... I'm on the side that feels they wrapped it up so that it feels conclusive enough, but because of the open plot points it's still open to continue.",anime,0

"&gt; Women are a huge part of the anime community.

I tell people so many times - yes, some anime panders to male interests but unlike comics, it does know how to pander to women and that is why we get a great gender ratio. Moe/Ecchi doesn't keep anyone away from anime, that's wishful thinking to fit an agenda pushing narrative, the statistics tell the truth. In fact for some decades women were the ones writing the most porn doujinshis in the big comic fests and were only overtaken recently again by doujinshis targeting men.

&gt; Women make up 60% of manga readership!

To this I would say though it is true when you talk about buying (which in the end is what matters though) not readership. Looking at many online platforms (on the high sea) and what is popular on them is pretty telling that there is a huge male readership that isn't accounted for. 

Another important thing is merchandise, but I can't find statistics on that.

"- Always subbed.

- Never drop. So far I've managed to avoid ever dropping an anime. Probably the closest I got was during the second season of Sister Princess, but I made it through.

- No ongoing anime. I don't watch anything while it's airing, or generally anything for which an additional season has already been announced.

- One at a time. I start an anime show, watch it, finish it, and then start the next.

- Always watch every unique OP and ED at least once. If it sucks then I'll skip it after that, but I'll always give it the benefit of the doubt for 90 seconds.

- In my PTW queue, shows right next to each other should be similar in length, but different in content. Also, every show should be followed by a show that I expect to be superior to it in at least one respect (story, characters, animation quality, art style, comedic value, whatever).",anime,0

"What would you say about an incomplete story at the end of 13 or 26 episodes? For example, an anime stays faithful to its source material (even to its last episode) but cannot weave all loose ends by the end, and is a big fat ""go read the source material"" sign? I find that anime original endings are typically not too good, so personally I would prefer to read *part* of a good story rather than get that same story but with a *wonky* *ending*. If an anime does not do an anime original ending and stays true to its source material to the end of the anime, then the *specific* critism that the anime ""did not tie up loose ends"" (assuming that ""good"" stories need to tie up loose ends) *can* be fairly argued against with a ""read the source material, the conflict is resolved afterwards"".

On the other hand, when someone says, ""go read the source material"" because they want you to *reread* events that already occurred in the anime (as opposed to what was mentioned above, where the goal was to *read* *ahead*), then it is the anime's fault for portraying a specific event in a displeasing manner.",anime,0

The deathbed confession seemed awfully ambivalent and wishy washy. I've read a few theories, but I really want to hear what other people have to think about the ending, as it definitely left me soured. Maybe other perspectives will have an impact on me.

"In Japanese wrestling younger trainees are called ""young boys"" (their official name is young lions, but they get called boys too) and they do NOT have a good time.

To look at it for the completely opposite direction, let's say there's a show that set's out to be the Citizen Kane of anime, now let's say that it pulls it off. That achievement means nothing to the actual quality of the show when compared to the shows writing, art, sound, etc.   ",anime,0

"It depends on how/when/where they chose to end the anime. For example I'll use the old Berserk anime from the 90's.

The golden age arc is great on its own, and conclusive for the story of the band of the hawk, but when you get to the end there are certain very big plot points that are left unanswered. It's not a massive cliffhanger since the story of the band of the hawk is resolved with the eclipse, but then you realize guts' story isn't over and you want more. It's not enough to make the show bad, but it's enough to leave you feeling a bit cock-blocked at the end. This makes it a good advertisement for the source material where the story is continued, but it makes the anime itself not as good. Now, recently berserk just got a sequel to that anime (technically a sequel to the movies that covered the same arc, but a continuation none the less), and even though that new adaptation has plenty of criticisms that can be levied against it, people can now point to something to say yes they made more of that anime, and feel less hung out to dry by the original.",anime,0

"I hate megathreads because I never look at them. If it were possible, I would agree with a fanart cap so that Re:Zero isn't shitting up my whole page and I go to another sub. Maybe max 2 or 3 on the front page and you can't post more until they fall off. Or only one fanart thread per series because I like Re:Zero but it was really annoying coming here for a while.",anime,0

"I'm not sure what you're getting at, but I'll try to explain what I mean.

The LN of Re:Zero is miles ahead of the Anime and in it there's a lot more explained on the witch and other mysteries in the Anime (from what I have heard). People usually use this as an argument as to why the Anime feels incomplete. They say that the Anime isn't incomplete since the source explains everything, so that complaining about not knowing stuff is invalid, since in the source it gets explained in the end.

Now, my problem is that the part of the source that wasn't adapted doesn't influence the Anime experience of the part that was adapted. What I saw wasn't complete, the Anime isn't complete and it's the Anime I'm judging, not its source.",anime,0

"I don't remember the last time a first episode got me this hype, AotS already, jk lol but really I love ViVid Strike so much, I usually don't watch sport anime or cute girls anime but wow. That ending scene, I wonder if Rinne has some sort of secret she never told Fuka. Damn, and now I learn this anime is apart of a huge franchise, why haven't I heard of it before? Sorry if its best for me to start elsewhere guys, but I'm already in love with this show.",anime,0

"Pretty good finale, especially since I watched that atrocity 91 Days threw at me right before.

Aside from the obvious ""needs season 2"", I think the show needs a structural romantic element. There's a lot of allusion and sexual context at times, but nothing substantial. ",anime,0

"I only picked up IBO about a month ago and I'm already so hyped up for this season. This episode was an onslaught of information so I'll have to go back and make sure I've got everything straight, lol, but they *nailed* the tone and atmosphere right out of the gate. 

It's going to be great keeping track of where the conflicts come from this time around. The straight-up antagonists sure, but I'm also getting a ""alaya-vijnana"" versus ""non alaya-vijnana"" vibe early on. Get the feeling Orga's going to have his hands really, really full keeping his house in order with the influx of new recruits. I also think this new guy, Lord Kujan, has a chance of turning traitor. He's got a temper, already seems disgruntled with how things are handled, and he just has that look about him. Calling that he'll pull a Zuko and join forces with Tekkadan by the end of this season.

Sidebar: I'm so ready for another season of [*this*](http://imgur.com/a/tScEm) simmering little subplot, too. IBO's Simon and Kaylee.",anime,0
