I actually don't know the exact exposure time. I just held the shutter down and did guess-and-check work. ISO was at ~1000-1500. Camera used was a Nikon D7000 on a tripod with the kit lens (18-105). I was pretty surprised on how well I could see it with my naked eye. The original image was a bit ""orange"" so I bumped up the blue a little and took out some of that orange (maybe caused by the moon light?). With how bright it was out, I'm pretty happy with the results. Going forward I'll make sure to stay away from exposures that span for so long. I have a few other images that might look a little better after some light editing, but this was the image that showed it the best. Also, this image was taken at roughly 3:10AM EST.",space,1

"**What is the chemical composition of the local giant planets?**

Gas giants (Jupiter & Saturn) are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. Ice giants (Uranus & Neptune) are composed mainly of heavier elements like oxygen, carbon and nitrogen. I would like to know what percentage of the volume of each planet is what element.

[This publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC350422/pdf/pnas00499-0036.pdf) provides the answer (on page 3) for Earth, Venus and Mercury. I’m interested similar data for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

I can readily find the composition of the atmospheres (e.g. Saturn’s atmosphere is 96% hydrogen, 3% helium, 1% other), but not for the deeper levels or the cores (e.g. how much of the whole of Saturn is hydrogen).

Obviously, any documented percentages would be best approximations, with certain margins of error. But I have been unable to find even that much (outside of atmospheres), only vague statements of “mostly”. I suspect that what I ask is simply unknown, but if you do have a concrete answer then please provide a citation.

"As the squishy’s ship entered the system’s Oort cloud it began spewing out millions of little von neumann machines that proceeded to gobble up a bunch of asteroids and comets and build from their constituent matter a large rocky-ice intelligence (which shall hereby be referred to as Rice). Meanwhile, the squishy noticed a gas giant wandering through the Oort cloud and thought it had interesting swirls so he moved his ship into orbit around it. The squishy then proceeded to pass out for a few thousand years.

While the squishy slept, Rice began building and manufacturing all the necessary components for an approximately two hundred thousand year observation period of the third planet from the star, which observations from nearby interstellar civilizations agreed, was at the beginning of a mass extinction event.

The squishy’s civilization had bid on and been awarded this contract by offering to do the whole thing dirt-cheap via their new Rice technology. They were to observe close-up and collate the resulting footage of said mass extinction, which would then be distributed/disseminated across the galaxy and various satellite galaxies, this being of monumental significance to the squishy’s entire civilization, as it would upjump them into the more important sectors of galactic federation.

The spectacle that was a mass extinction, sometimes called Planet Ex, had recently (i.e., within the last few million years) become widely loved by the galaxy et. al., it being the preferred form of entertainment, of watching the quick and the slow of millions of species going extinct. It made them feel all warm and gooey inside, these interstellar civilizations, to see life snuffed out en masse.

But why was he here, the squishy asked himself every time he woke, if Rice was handling everything? Perhaps it was because his civilization wanted something squishy and familiar and biological, a fault of his civilization, yes, but he could understand their fears, of not wanting this screwed up, of having him as the backup. And maybe too, he was here to keep Rice company. For these asteroid-comet level artificial intelligences could, if left alone for long enough, become eccentric.

For example, there was the time a Rice-like mind drastically lowered its albedo and altered its infrared signature and disappeared into a system’s Oort cloud. And when its squishy woke he was met with a message asking him if he wanted to play hide and seek and that the Rice was hiding and would he please come and find it? Then there was the time a Rice tried to assemble itself into its own planet, and thereby grow its own life, which ended with no life and a despondent Rice and an attempted suicide by star. The most common eccentricity, however, was when a Rice molded asteroids into pleasing configurations, e.g., making gigantic asteroidal squishies, though these tended to be unstable and somewhat disturbing to said squishy, to see oneself orders of magnitude larger, with every physical characteristic of oneself rendered and exaggerated in rock and ice. Though, it should be noted, that the Rice usually only meant this as a sincere gesture, its way of saying, I like you squishy.",space,1

What's the purpose of people hiding the flatness of the earth if it truly is flat?  There'd be no benefit.  

So the moon, that you see in the sky is round (obviously you can see this yourself) proves there are round objects in space.  We see the sun, it is round too.  We have sent craft to other planets and moons and they are round, so why would the earth be the exception?  

You hear his argument against gravity saying that there's no way this could be the case, well, what's on the other side of the flat earth?  What holds people on on that side?  And if the earth is flat like a coin and stands on its side what keeps EVERYONE from falling off?  

And, if space is so big, as big as we know it is, then how are we oriented in space if the earth is flat?  If every object is flat why would they all be flat and round like a coin?  And why would every object be oriented in the same way toward the earth so we seem them like a coin?",space,1

Zoom in on the image I posted at the top to get an idea of just how large endeavour crater is- and then be amazed at the fact that Opportunity has travelled nearly double the crater's diameter in its time on Mars!

"No it couldn't since the density of UY Scuti is a lot less.  
It is only 12-20 times as massive as the Sun, but its volume is approximately 1700 times that of the Sun. (Initial mass would have been 25-40 solar masses, but it has lost over half of it.)

Note that I will work with circular orbits, not elliptical orbits. And tau = 2\*pi

### Have a year still be a year
Say you want to keep the orbital period the same i.e., 1 year:  
G \* M \* T^2 = tau^(2) \* r^3  
^(Where *G* is the gravitational constant, *M* is the mass of the star, *T* is the orbital period and *R* is the distance between Earth and the star it's orbiting [center to center])

Increasing the mass from 1 solar mass to 20 solar masses means the radius would increase by 20^(1/3), in order to keep the orbital period at 1 year. This would mean we would orbit UY Scuti at a distance of 4.1\*10^11 m from its center, well within its radius of (12.9±1.3)\*10^11 m.

### Screw birthdays
UY Scuti's luminosity is 340000 times that of the Sun. The average [solar irradiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_luminosity) on Earth is 1361 W/m^2 and can be calculated using:  
L = 2\*tau

"I feel you mate, I really do.  Spending the majority of my working career as a line chef in some basic chain restaurants my back ached and so did my bank balance.  
Recently a guy flittered through our kitchen over Christmas who I became acquainted with quickly.  Turns out he had just finished getting his Masters in Chemistry.  
Deciding that chemistry was one thing I enjoyed in school I decided to look in to a change of career.  

(Preface:- I live in the UK so translate to your relevant qualifications) Now my GCSE's suck so I'd have to retake them to get at least a C grade preferably better.  Then I'd need what we call an Access to Higher Education which is a year of studies and exams to prepare you for University.  After which I could complete a 3 year course for a Bachelor's Degree or complete a final year to become a Masters of Chemistry otherwise know as an MChem so I could become Mr Skinnx86 MSc. Either would get me places, a Masters gets you there faster(easier?). 

For myself I wanted to get involved with some of the more intricate levels of space travel, help develop polymers for rockets &amp; probes.  Perhaps even discover better ways to propel them.

There are many other areas that one could enter to help out.  There is the telecommunications involved, the engineering, the chemistry, R&amp;D, 3D design &amp; CAD, CFD a.k.a Computational Fluid Dynamics, Physics, Maths, tools, special lubrication for bearings in a vacuum, etc. the list is big. 

You could always read Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance and discover the different amount of varieties of people he employed to make SpaceX work (or you could just read it for the fun  of it ;-) ). 

I recommend listing to the following two podcasts produced by the Planetary Society

"One hypothesis, developed at Oxford University, is that the hexagon forms where there is a steep latitudinal gradient in the speed of the atmospheric winds in Saturn's atmosphere. Similar regular shapes were created in the laboratory when a circular tank of liquid was rotated at different speeds at its centre and periphery. The most common shape was six sided, but shapes from three to eight sided were also produced. The shapes form in an area of turbulent flow between the two different rotating fluid bodies with dissimilar speeds. A number of stable vortices of similar size form on the slower (south) side of the fluid boundary and these interact with each other to space themselves out evenly around the perimeter. The presence of the vortices influences the boundary to move northward where each is present and this gives rise to the polygon effect. Polygons do not form at wind boundaries unless the speed differential and viscosity parameters are within certain margins and so are not present at other likely places, such as Saturn's south pole or the poles of Jupiter.

Other researchers claim that lab studies exhibit vortex streets, a series of spiraling vortices not observed in Saturn's hexagon. Simulations show that a shallow, slow, localized meandering jetstream in the same direction as Saturn's prevailing clouds is able to match the observed behaviors of Saturn's Hexagon with the same boundary stability.",space,0

The martian day is 24 hours 39 minutes long.  This is close enough to Earth's day that it becomes useful to follow the Martian day and cumbersome to follow the Earth day.  The Mars day of 24h 39m Earth time is divided exactly into 24 *mars hours*.  A mars hour is 60 *mars minutes* and a mars minute is 60 *mars seconds.*  For engineering and scientific applications, the SI second would be used as needed, but it wouldn't be part of daily life.

The martian year would be divided into 12 months, each named after the constellation in the zodiac which Mars is positioned during that month, as viewed from the sun.  The length of the months are unequal, due to the varying orbital speed of Mars in its eccentric orbit.  Months near aphelion are longer than those at perihelion.",space,0

"There's a difference IMO between pursuing Science and Engineering because we think STEM is a worthy goal in and of itself and pursuing it out of fear of the Ruskies.

"The only satellites that'll burn up without any interference in the near future are in sub-1000 km orbits generally (smaller satellites' orbits also degrade faster than larger sats in general due to their lower m/A). Anything outside the dense LEO orbits just above the earth surface will generally not re-enter (discounting highly eccentric orbits with a perigee below this altitude).

The best practice is to place stuff in empty parking orbits once sats have reached their end-of-life (like GEO sats are normally at 36000 km altitude but they're boosted to 37000km where there's nothing but other old sats). Unfortunately this still does not always happen because the fuel necessary for this could also be used for orbit maintenance and extend the sats lifespan for a bit, or contact with the sat is lost, or people just don't care.
