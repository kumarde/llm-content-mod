Even if it's a law school, even if it's 12 pm on a Wednesday, there is free beer and wine. At best, you'll stick out without a drink in your hand; at worst, you'll be bullied.

"I totally agree with you. But for the sake of clarity, the argument actually applies there as well. The argument is that white western civilizations keep the rest of the world down through the use of international organizations like the WTO and IMF which effectively limit how much control a nation actually has over its own destiny. The use of corporations and trade deals further cements neocolonialism with the result that nations in Africa and elsewhere are in many ways very dependent on the white power structure of global economics. 

Like I said, I get what you are saying and agree, but there is a lot more to the argument than just white people are racist as if it's a bumper sticker. The thing to keep in mind is that under that line of argument racism has a specific definition that incorporates that power imbalance. That isn't the same as the normal daily use of the term. And that's what causes confusion and makes the people making that argument seem unhinged, when the argument is valid and should just use a different term.

A friend of mine was north of the city in the boonies when a copy turned on his siren behind her. She slowed down, put on her hazards but didn't pull over until she got to a well lit parking lot. She was arrested for evading police and thrown in jail for the weekend.
