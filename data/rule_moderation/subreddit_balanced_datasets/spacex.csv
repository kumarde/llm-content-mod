"NASA have diverse interests from various regional offices, SpaceX, however, have one interest - to colonise Mars and one primary site in Hawthorne California where everything gets built and all strategic decisions are made. This focus allows SpaceX to achieve Mars milestones right now rather than NASA's 10 - 20 years. NASA astronauts will get to Mars a lot sooner with SpaceX help and they'll have no problem finding life - because there'll be a whole bunch of SpaceX engineers to greet them!

"I think it is safe to assume that Trump is mostly a business man and really doesn't care about the science itself. The question in Trumps mind is whether or not we can afford the measures of combating Climate Change and would they make a difference. The United States is not the largest polluter, we do have high standards for emissions; however these high standards are driving business to the 3rd world in order to keep prices & labor low. 

The question in the mind of all politicians is whether or not the changes we make are actually effective. Which seems to be a overwhelming majority of no, the changes are not. So if the changes are not effective why would we add additional burdens and slow down development, which also funds research. 

I think there is a lot of people that just want to yell CLIMATE CHANGE DENIER, but doesn't want to have a hard discussion on the truth of the matter. The world is fucked at any standard so we can go to war to make other submit to our regulations, we can put sanctions and cause their people to starve in order to listen to our  requirements, or we can drastically fun in energy research and hope for the best in the next 100 - 500 or so years.

Then you have a very large area where people can live without suits. You could grow food with grow lamps inside or have the greenhouse outside the cave and if you find some underground source of water it could become a pretty nice place to live. Set up their oen day/night schedule and be protected from radiation. 

Once manufacturing is built up they can move into large surface enclosers and cities but a huge marian cave may be a good transition point from a collection of hab modules to a full city sized domes.

"Hi Elon. I've heard you explain your decision to pursue Mars colonization as a process in which you considered the ways that you can have the greatest positive impact for humanity. I see that this project fulfills this criterion (and admire the endeavor), but I've always wondered: Did you consider a project to address serious poverty, hunger, or disease directly?

This is potentially worth 100s of billion of dollars. And that money could then be used to launch more sats. And they are also doing the whole production process just like to the rockets I think? Which will save costs and allow him to scale up production just like he is doing with tesla. And if he manged to scale up solar city with all these companies he might be on track to being the richest man. If tesla, solar city, SpaceX and a telecom company could coordinate to ride the exponential curve at best time to all maximize profit that would be the ultimate 5 types of companies to do that with. I think he will have companies throwing money at him if the launch cadences take off in 2017. In 2020 and after SpaceX alone will be taking billions from investors. And tesla and solar city could be doing the same. This satellite thing could be worth even more.

"I have a few, some Mars architecture related and others not


Is SpaceX planning to develop a Mars colony infrastructure themselves? Or are they just planning on building the transportation service to Mars and hoping other organisations will develop the actual colony infrastructure. 


Is there plans for a commercial ultra-heavy launch variant of the BFB with a payload fairing? Or is that not on the cards because it's not on the critical path.


The spaceship part of the architecture has to have pretty damn good life support to keep 100 people alive for the trip to mars (and presumably to be able to carry them back as well). Considering we've never had a spacecraft capable of carrying more than 10 people before, can the spaceship be hired out for use as a space station during the months it's just floating up there waiting for a Mars alignment? I mean, that ship dwarfs the capabilities of the ISS in nearly every way. 

You mentioned in the presentation that you finalising the Falcon 9 design within a few years. What changes will that entail? Is this ""just"" 1.3 even fuller thrust, or are there more changes to come. What improvements came about as a result of testing recovered boosters?



If the worst happens and there isn't outside development of your (amazing) Mars architecture, what's plan B? Can SpaceX fund it themselves over time?

"You have made some incorrect assumptions here. 

For one thing, you seem to be thinking you will need to replicate the solar radiation falling on a piece of land. That is not correct at all. The vast majority of solar radiation is not absorbed by the plant at all, photosynthesis only absorbs two fairly narrow bands of the visible light spectrum, so you only need to produce those two wavelengths. Farms also suffer from reduced productivity due to growing seasons and available water, so you can do better indoors in a controlled environment. Controlling the atmosphere composition and temperature will further increase efficiency. In reality, you have overestimated the power requirements by an order of magnitude by including all these unnecessary inefficiencies in your plan.

A more reliable way to estimate the power requirements is from the actual energy requirements of a person. The average person uses 100W of power. A typical crop is about 1-2% efficient at converting light into food calories (sugar cane is closer to 10%), so each person will require about 10kW of power, not 300. If you are planning to install solar cells to provide that power, you will need to install 3-4 times that ammount to make up for the changing angle of the sun and the nighttime. So you would need 30-40 kW of solar panels per person. Each kW of solar panels will be 10m2 on mars, so each person would require just 300-400 m2 of solar panels. Assuming the martian solar panels would have a mass of 25kg/kW, you would need to bring about 1 ton of solar panels per colonist.

Your colony of a million people would requre just 40GW of solar panels to provide food, and that solar array would be a square 20km on a side.

So the ITS booster differs from the Falcon 9 in two major ways, in terms of landing:

- The ITS launch and landing pad is probably not rotationally symmetric - i.e. it probably cannot do a 1-engine landing burn were it has no precise control over roll motion - except if they do methane based SuperDracos for roll control. 2-, 3- or higher order landing engine configurations allow roll control via gimbaling alone.
- Even ignoring the limited gimbaling range, 2-engine landing burns on the Falcon 9 have way too high TWR. It's two configurations that make the most sense: ""maximum efficiency"" and ""maximum control"". For the Falcon 9 that's 3-engine and 1-engine burns.

"Well, no other US booster uses more than 3 (liquid) engines on its first stage either (solids being inherently simple). Using 9 small engines was a very different design philosophy, and there was a lot of skepticism in the early days that increasing the number of engines would just increase the chances of having a failure (engine-out ability notwithstanding).

The only other operational rockets that come close are Proton with 6 engines (and a not great reliability record) and Soyuz with 5 (each engine has 4 combustion chambers though, which makes it look like more). Most US boosters have 1 (Atlas, Delta Med, New Shepard) or 2 (Antares) 

The other point is how could someone buying Spacex engines build and operate a rocket that could compete on price/schedule with Spacex? Spacex gets the engines at cost, while the competitor would get them at retail, and spacex would *probably* get first dibs if engines became the schedule limitation.

There's also launch site costs, $200,000 per launch times six launches.

I gather that chamber and exhaust pressure affect the engines Isp so does this mean burning at less than full throttle consumes more fuel per unit of thrust obtained?

"I would imagine most of that equipment would be on a basic pallet or simply tied down with straps. Sure, there WILL need to be some kind of crane to lower from the ITS lander cargo hold, 30 meters up.

But the idea that everything needs to be shipped in a steel box on the first flight makes no sense to me. It's extra mass, and probably wasted volume.

Containerization works well when you have the infrastructure to support it. 

* A container ships on customized ships that haul only standardized shipping containers. Most of the time, the only passengers are crew.
* Those containers are then offloaded by enormous gantry cranes that are also specialized equipment.
* The containers are then moved by forklift, rail, and semi, reducing the number of times an individual person needs to physically handle the goods inside.

The advantage of containerization is that goods can be transported easily on a variety of transportation equipment. This is not the requirement on Mars - not right away. **The requirement of the first flights to Mars will be to maximize mass, not maximize transportation flexibility.**

The examples you give above - there certainly should be *something* to help a guy install hundreds of square meters of solar panels, but a steel box isn't going to help him - a dolly will. Shovels and loaders will need to be self-propelled. A pallet isn't going to do that.

&gt;Built everything with large containers and you can get it out, lower it to the surface and move the big components around required to set up a base. 

But what are you going to move the big components **with**? Now you're stuck bringing bigger and bigger equipment to move the big containers you brought. This is just a feedback loop.


I don't disagree that at some point, standardized space-worthy shipping containers will be necessary. I think they'll be essential to having a healthy economy between Mars, Earth, and other planets. But shoving mass at Mars will cost a premium price for the first several missions, and that will require specialized shipping &amp; logistic solutions, not standardized ones.",spacex,0

Yes, triangulation pointed towards the strut, and this was established early.

Struts were way unlikely - the things were heavily overrated.

It was only when the other faults were being closed off that they did a more extensive testing of the struts, and found that a very low percentage of the struts were faulty. This would not have been long before they announced it. Then they had to remove and test every strut in every constructed rocket - which they decided not to do, instead scrapping remaining 1.1s and to go ahead with upgraded rockets instead, using a final version 1.1 only for the DSCOVR mission.

I think science and tourism will be the two big drivers for the initial few trips to Mars.  Science first by a couple of synodic periods, but tourists will be the big profit earner soon after (though obviously not enough to recoup costs quickly).  The mistake is to think that colonization will be rapid.  Colonists will be the 1% of arrivals for the first 20 years until more infrastructure and certainty is in place.

The reason that Antarctica still has no resort hotel is because it was banned by international treaty (which i fully support).   Let's not make that mistake with Mars.  Even so, tourists now fly over Antarctica, and will do the same for Mars.  And for every tourist (adventurer/explorer) there will be a staff member at the resort and for every scientist an enineer helping to keep it all working.

Jeff Bezos is the philosophical opposite of the CEO who leaves money on the table.   If for no other reason, he'd go after the business only to insure Musk wasn't the sole beneficiary.  Bezos is competitive like that.

" The european settlement of north america was largely funded and organized by private individuals or organizations. They were claiming territory for their sponsor state so they were ultimately responsible to leadership back home, but this was a consequence of existing law.  
 Today no signatory to the treaty may claim territory offworld. A private organization likewise may not lay claim to any resource in space on behalf of its sponsor state. That does not apply if the private organization instead forms a new state, or if they merely facilitate the transport of individuals who then form a new state.  
 As with starting a new country here on Earth, the problem is one of recognition. You can claim to be the Democratic Republic of Hellas Planitia until you're blue in the face but it means nothing until an existing country recognizes you as such. Existing countries are not going to recognize a competitor state with the freedom and capability to claim territory in space, so the colony would first have to agree to the terms of the outer space treaty. That means the colony would own their equipment but not the land under it. Their air and water would be 'rented'. They would have no legal authority to prevent someone from getting to Mars, setting up a habitat right next to them, walking down to the ice mine and helping themselves.
 That would be fine at first. Mars is likely to be quite the frontier for a while as a wide variety of people with very different views try to make a go of it. At some point, though, the population will be large enough and cohesive enough to negotiate new treaty terms to reflect the realities of permanent occupation.",spacex,0

Long and rectangular would be almost impossible to get to the surface with the cargo arrangement in a 'stock' ITS. It might fit through the hatch but couldn't be tipped vertical til it was completely outside. There would be the possibility of overbalancing the ITS.

Having the pallets fit into a support grid in the cargo bay is a great idea! A roof crane could pick each pallet up and place it on the surface crane's loading platform. You're right, no need for a cargo bay floor on the return trip, at least not at first.

"&gt; Carbon fibre rotors would weigh a lot less than the 20% of fuel currently used to land.

It's not 20% of fuel they require to land: they need to kill the final ~0.2 km/s of velocity propulsively, which only requires a relatively small amount of booster fuel (less than ~8 tons - or about 2% of the booster's propellant mass).

The overhead due to being able to land the booster relates to roughly these factors:

- the 3-engine re-entry burn to protect the booster (~16 tons of fuel)
- the landing legs (they cause extra drag on ascent and weigh about ~2 tons)
- the grid fins (extra drag on ascent and weigh about ~0.5 tons)
- the landing fuel (min ~8 tons of fuel)

As you can see eliminating the landing fuel does not eliminate the other costs.

And then there are also the lots of disadvantages of an autogyro approach, compared to precise propulsive landings.

"I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/3lvl5a/economics_of_commercial_spaceflight_or_how_can/) about a year ago and spelled out several different ways to make money from space-based assets.  I think that is important so far as stuff that happens off of the Earth is going to depend on spaceflight becoming cheap, which in turn is only going to happen if people have a reason to go into space in the first place.

One of the things that SpaceX has done that is unique compared to other launch providers is that they have turned rocket production into an assembly line.... sort of like mass producing automobiles.  Given his background, it isn't surprising that Elon Musk is generating some synergy between Tesla and SpaceX on this very point.  That in turn means that SpaceX has created a monster that needs to be fed in terms of even just the Hawthorne plant in terms of putting up tonnage into space.

Triangular trades in space can happen, and indeed I think that ultimately will be the part that will ultimately make colonization on Mars work.  It is also something I've pointed out that you can't rule out colonizing other parts of the Solar System too, including the Moon, asteroids, or frankly even Venus.  Venusian colonization is going to be a tougher nut to crack than Mars, but not impossible.... and strangely something Elon Musk touched upon briefly even at the IAC talk.

The key to getting all of this happening though is to get very cheap and low-cost transportation to all of these places in the Solar System.

"I tend to agree with you in this debate. I'm very interested in exploring the idea of a Mars economy a bit deeper.

What would be used as currency? Barter system at first? 

Who would own the natural capital? Who has land rights? Who could grant land rights? Who would own the habitation modules? Is renting out your module (or one that you eventually build) on the table?

I believe this is an incredible opportunity to attempt a different way of doing things. Let's say that with your ticket purchase, you ""buy in"" to land rights. So everyone who goes becomes an owner of the natural capital available for a specific area. If a company sends a refinery to make steel they buy in with their investment of capital but then the laborers who go also get some ownership.

The idea I'm trying to get at here is to not have all of the surplus labor siphoned off the planet and back to earth.

"Two problems I see with that idea:

1. Elon mentioned briefly that their primary strategy for dealing with interplanetary radiation is going to be ""point the crew compartment away from the sun."" This severely limits the potential orientations that ships underway could dock at.

2. If the ships are nestled up against each other side by side like we see in the video, then they're not going to have room to deploy half their solar arrays. Even if they share each others' power supplies there likely won't be enough juice to keep things running long term. And you can't just say ""well just have them dock at an angle instead of side-by-side"" because then that means that only one ship will be able to angle its panels towards the sun at one time so you'd *still* be getting only half the power you need. 

I'd propose that instead of having the ships docked for the entire trip, have them only dock up temporarily every 20 days or so. The ships can run off of reserve power for short periods and temporary docking should provide only minimal radiation exposure, and people who want to visit (or even completely move) to a different ship can do so.

And of course the ships can dock together if an emergency evacuation is necessary, but I'm sure that goes without saying. ",spacex,0

"&gt; Definitely possible. Though it might add more complexity than to the test than SpaceX would like. It would probably take a decent amount of time and resources for engineers to figure out and program a good recovery profile for the booster. In addition, special tooling would have to be created to lay up a fiberglass nose cone for the booster, and that tooling would only be used once, I don't think a FH nose cone mold could be used in this case.
&gt;
&gt; It'd probably be more efficient for SpaceX to just to let the in-flight abort booster breakup and fall in the ocean. 

So it might be useful to think of this problem as: ""There's ~$35m worth of cash falling into the ocean. How much engineering does it require to save that cash, and does it make sense economically?""

But ... regarding the nose cone: it could be more complex than that, because the moment the Dragon takes off, air flow will hit the interstage like a hydraulic hammer. A few months ago I guesstimated the forces involved and came to a figure of around 20 tons-force coming down on it brutally...

Even with an ideal nose cone it would be a couple of tons suddenly hitting the booster - I'm not sure it would be able to survive that.

Then there's the added complication that the Dragon will take off in a sideways direction - which would expose the booster to asymmetric (and turbulent) air flow ...

"&gt; Anyone know of any big potential challenges I'm not thinking of?

- The in-flight filling up of the propellant COPVs to hundreds of bars of pressure would certainly be a delicate operation. It does not have to be a fast process, but it has to be robust.
- If stable combustion depends on a minimum combustion chamber pressure then ignition might be more chaotic and more energetic than with hypergolics plus because the ignition system cannot possibly cover the whole cross section, so there's a risk of an explosive but not yet burning gas mixture exiting the thrusters.

"It think it would be crazy NOT to do this. Have the rocket aiming for the launch mount zero position, and the launch mount tracking the rocket's actual position very precisely. The mount could move in the X/Y axes, and rotate on the Z axis. There are limits to what the rocket can correct for. A sudden strong gust of wind right before the rocket is being mechanically guided into the clamp could be impossible to correct for depending on how much thrust the positioning thrusters can practically provide. The landing mount can move as fast and as accurately as you need it to. It's a much simpler problem to solve than trying to get the rocket to do that.

The sum of design decisions. Soyuz was originally an ICBM and has kept its all weather capabilities because weather at its launch site is often pretty bad. It does this with high margins, simplicity, and various design elements.

Weather means basically wind and lightning. All rockets can handle precipitation. A lot of Soyuz ground systems are to deal with ground level winds.

For example, the huge encompassing launch tower is an important element to wind resistance; Soyuz hangs from it, rather than sitting on a launch pad, transferring wind loads to the tower evenly, and the tower ""follows"" the rocket during launch. Horizontal integration is also important to windy weather operations.

High level winds are handled by having a extra strong frame. Dunno if they have any special lightning treatment.",spacex,0

Transparent membranes can easily be brought packed tightly in rolls, wrapped and sealed around crude frame structures, and be farmed from there.

The most important part is to develop the basic modular hardware for those few systems.  Airlock, environmental systems, and the hydroponics.  Modular airlock systems easy to install will be needed for every single structure, not just greenhouses.  Coming up with a great design for that is a critical piece to the whole puzzle.  

For the greenhouses it would be helpful if the environmental systems can bring them up to human levels for work cycles.  The ability to do the work out of a suit will help tremendously with efficiency of man hours.

If some sort of abort capsule was able to separate and land, then well done, you have just crash-landed a bunch of people in some unknown and probably unreachable location on an airless world with insufficient supplies to last until any conceivable rescue mission arrives. Launch abort on mars is useless until a decent well equipped colony is up and running. It's definitely a Version 2.0 problem. Until then, if you don't make it to space that day, you die.

"&gt;""No political agenda"" doesn't exist, sadly.

I didn't really make that point as clear as I should have. I'm talking about the individuals vetted to make the trip rather than the organizations doing the vetting itself. A very great deal of indivudals are apolitical these days. Of course, they'll still be filtered through the organizations choosing candidates for selection, but if at all possible I'd suggest that it would be more beneficial if colonists with no diehard loyalty to an existing nation state are part of the effort. 

The overall long term idea of what I'm suggesting is to create a nation state on Mars that isn't politically dominated by a culture from a preexisting state on Earth. A true melting pot whose population are free to create a new planetary identity from a nucleus of all the Earth's population. If the population was one half American, one quarter Chinese and one quarter Russian, then the Americans would impose a social orthodoxy on the minorities. Another important issue is that it omits a great part of the plurality of the human experience. If we're truly committed to creating a back up for humanity, it shouldn't be an incomplete one.

It would be an interesting social experiment to see if leveling the playing field with a small representative sample of various cultures would foster social cohesion or division. Historically speaking, in multicultural societies there will typically be a social orthodoxy imposed on minority groups by the ethnic group that holds political dominance, typically through greater numbers. This can have several effects on diaspora from a different background to their host nation, including the formation of ethnic districts like the various Chinatowns, Little Italys' etc throughout the western world. If only a very small number of each group make up the part of a larger whole and are forced to cooperate to form a society will people bridge the gap, provided they can all communicate adequately through an intermediate language like English?

"&gt; how precise will the cargoship landing be?

Very. SpaceX plan to land the booster in the exact location it took off from. Without legs. The Mars landing portion need be no less accurate, once appropriate location beacons are in place.

&gt; how far away do they have to land from the mars base?

Depends on how paranoid they want to be about failures. Successful landings could be quite close; there's not much atmosphere to carry pressure waves, and you'll note even on Earth the amount of equipment on deck the ASDS during F9 landings. Terminal propulsion failures would probably warrant some standoff. How much depends on how fragile your structures are; given ""very"", you'd probably want a mile or so. Earlier failures would need to be planned to impact ""up range"".
 
&gt; how will the whole interaction between the mars base and the landed cargoships look like? how are you going to transport the cargo to the base?

I'd probably put the whole thing on dollies and roll it close to base. In the long run, perhaps even straight to a pressurized cargo lift tower. While you can have trucks and such, you really want to minimize EVA transport (and pipes for fluids). Cargo will likely be containerized, just so it doesn't float about and crash around during landings, and that'll make unload simpler.",spacex,0

Since two weeks of continuous darkness will kill most earth plants this makes artificial light the only way to grow food on the Moon.

"Would evaporating water from the surface material be even remotely feasible, efficiency-wise?

You could consider heating soil, collecting the resulting gas, and then dumping the load to avoid carrying weight, cooling it again to get sublimation, but the energy cost from the heat would be phenomenal... Maybe pumping heat from one sample to another to gain efficiency, but still tough.

And trying to sift it out of the soil, I don't have the background to know how that might be done, but it doesn't seem like an easy task...

Would it be better, then, to mine out below/around the fuel plant and get ice from deeper soil? Would there even be much in the soil? Once you get deep enough and find proper ice deposits maybe, and that has the benefit of leaving possible habitation areas/construction materials, but it would take a lot of upfront cost before you get sufficient amounts, I would think.

Basically, is the ice-mining approach even feasible? Would having a base near the caps be worthwhile simply for the ice-access? But what about the reduced sunlight and solar power? Transporting that fuel would be horrible, but using the craft as transport would cost only a portion of that fuel...

"&gt; This is 100% correct, but there's even more. Automobile manufacturers does the exact same 'grounding' as SpaceX does: The past failures of Falcon 9 were all design defect or manufacturing issues. If it was an automobile, it's equivalent to a well serviced car caching fire in the middle of a road, killing the driver. The likely response from a manufacturer to such incident is to ask customers to refrain from driving the vehicle, and immediately recall every affected car for a fix.

Sort of.

The auto analogy doesn't quite work due to scale.  A random car fire (even a fatal one) doesn't automatically mean that every car of the same model out there is likely to burst into flames.  Say you have 1 million Ford Fusions on the road. You don't tell everybody to stop driving every time one bursts into flames or a wheel falls off.

Now, you do your due diligence, you investigate and determine is was a systemic problem, some kind of materiel failure, design issue, etc, different thing.  Then you say ""Hey, stop driving that car until we can replace your vacuum-operated gutenator valve with a redesigned electric one.""

 But thats figuring that you have a million of a type of vehicle out there.  You don't ground the fleet because Timmy The Shade Tree Mechanic failed to tighten the fuel line on his car when he was doing some under-hood tinkering.
