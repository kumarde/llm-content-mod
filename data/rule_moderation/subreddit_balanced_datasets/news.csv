"Transcript:

Today, I have ordered a number of actions in response to the Russian government’s aggressive harassment of U.S. officials and cyber operations aimed at the U.S. election. These actions follow repeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the Russian government, and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U.S. interests in violation of established international norms of behavior.

All Americans should be alarmed by Russia’s actions. In October, my Administration publicized our assessment that Russia took actions intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.  These data theft and disclosure activities could only have been directed by the highest levels of the Russian government. Moreover, our diplomats have experienced an unacceptable level of harassment in Moscow by Russian security services and police over the last year.  Such activities have consequences.  Today, I have ordered a number of actions in response.

I have issued an executive order that provides additional authority for responding to certain cyber activity that seeks to interfere with or undermine our election processes and institutions, or those of our allies or partners.  Using this new authority, I have sanctioned nine entities and individuals:  the GRU and the FSB, two Russian intelligence services; four individual officers of the GRU; and three companies that provided material support to the GRU’s cyber operations.  In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury is designating two Russian individuals for using cyber-enabled means to cause misappropriation of funds and personal identifying information.  The State Department is also shutting down two Russian compounds, in Maryland and New York, used by Russian personnel for intelligence-related purposes, and is declaring “persona non grata” 35 Russian intelligence operatives.  Finally, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are releasing declassified technical information on Russian civilian and military intelligence service cyber activity, to help network defenders in the United States and abroad identify, detect, and disrupt Russia’s global campaign of malicious cyber activities.

These actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia’s aggressive activities. We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized. In addition to holding Russia accountable for what it has done, the United States and friends and allies around the world must work together to oppose Russia’s efforts to undermine established international norms of behavior, and interfere with democratic governance. To that end, my Administration will be providing a report to Congress in the coming days about Russia’s efforts to interfere in our election, as well as malicious cyber activity related to our election cycle in previous elections.

 5 For so exceedingly do they anger that it seemeth me that they have no fear of death; and they have lost their love, one towards another; and they thirst after blood and revenge continually.

 6 And now, my beloved son, notwithstanding their hardness, let us labor diligently; for if we should cease to labor, we should be brought under condemnation; for we have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness, and rest our souls in the kingdom of God.

. . . 

> 27 And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my words unto you, which were written by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the dust?

> 28 I declare these things unto the fulfilling of the prophecies. And behold, they shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the everlasting God; and his word shall hiss forth from generation to generation.

. . .

> 4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

> 5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.

> 6 And whatsoever thing is good is just and true; wherefore, nothing that is good denieth the Christ, but acknowledgeth that he is.

> 7 And ye may know that he is, by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I would exhort you that ye deny not the power of God; for he worketh by power, according to the faith of the children of men, the same today and tomorrow, and forever.

> 10 Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness. Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness.

> 11 And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I would say, in a carnal state, are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; they are without God in the world, and they have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness.

> 12 And now behold, is the meaning of the word restoration to take a thing of a natural state and place it in an unnatural state, or to place it in a state opposite to its nature?

> 13 O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish—good for that which is good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful.

> 14 Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again.

"**PSA: I was shadowbanned for posting a dissenting opinion in this thread. This was my comment.**

I also have ADHD, and I use medical pot every single day. It's better than Adderall. I definitely driver better high, just as I do most things better (except being an out of control, high-energy, low-focus spazz of course).

My main problem with the whole debate, as a medical user, is that it is not grounded in science. There is little scientific evidence that getting high makes you universally a poor driver, especially once you are used to it. That's the problem. Tons of people take prescription drugs and drive, but we're having a debate over that one: there is no test, and unless you are obviously impaired, you probably won't get into trouble. Why should pot be different?

Regardless, I want a scientifically rigorous process before we start making it illegal per strict liability to drive high. If I am safer when driving high than someone at 0.08 BAC, then I should be allowed to fucking drive. Simple as that. Old people don't all drive better than that, and they can still drive. We don't prevent everyone who drives poorly from driving. Maybe if I have 4 cups of coffee and drive, I am terrible. But, it's not illegal in-and-of-itself. The only reason alcohol and driving is so bad is that: - Impairment is similar across all people (does not seem to be true for pot). - It impairs judgement as well as reaction time (pot does not impair judgement). Drunk people are more impulsive and make more risky decisions. High people, on the whole, do not. - We have sufficient scientific evidence of what makes a good threshold, and the standard is based in scientific evidence.

Far, FAR too many people just scream: JUST DON'T DRIVE IF YOU WANT TO GET FUCKED UP. Well, what if I use it for actual medicine that makes me a better driver and calmer person over all? We need a discussion rooted in solid science not emotional bullshit spouted by ignorant know-it-alls.

Even attempts at earning extra income, even via twitch.tv where you stream video games, have failed because the market has oversaturated. All markets are oversaturated.

Do you *really* believe them? Is that it or are these abuses so common place that cops honestly believe it's not them or their department, but those other *bad* cops? Maybe this nonsense response worked a decade ago, but there are too many news stories, too many videos, and too much evidence to think what this cop is saying is a true statement.

They gloss over the ridiculous, at times denial-of-reality level of deference cops get from internal ""investigations,"" from the criminal system in general, and other state actors, they gloss over how police unions do everything in their power to reduce any or eliminate any accountability on cops, how they protect the bad, violent ones, how the contracts they negotiate enable cops convicted of crimes to receive their jobs back when public ire dies down *and with backpay* (including on the argument that cops convicted of crimes were engaged in conduct which was typical and unpunished in the case of other cops, so they were unfairly singled out).

"That's a pretty big topic, and I don't think there are any perfect solutions, but I do think there are some that could produce results very quickly.

First, any time an officer uses a weapon (even less lethal ones) an investigation needs to be kicked off. And not an investigation by Internal Affairs or the District Attorney. An investigation by an independent board, potentially above the state level. In the case of a lethal encounter with the police, I think the FBI needs to investigate along with an independent review board.

Police unions need to be reformed to be less about protecting shitty cops and more about fostering positive relationships with the police and recruiting _good_ cops.

Police themselves need training in identifying subjects with mental conditions, which the data we have suggests has a large impact on the reduction of use of force, let alone lethal force.

Police need to be required to not only have vehicle-based recording equipment, but body-based recording equipment. Audio and video. And if the audio and video is not evidence in an investigation, it needs to be deleted in 90 days. The audio and video also must not be run through software that identifies people with biometric markers.

Police must be trained to de-escalate a situation as a primary focus, and that use of force (especially lethal force) is an absolute last resort. If evidence arises that force was used as an initial measure, it must lead to an automatic suspension without pay while an investigation is conducted.

Community policing must be done without firearms. Period. Beat cops walking a neighborhood should not be bringing weapons into that neighborhood. There is little evidence to show those weapons are needed, and the chance of that weapon being used is increased simply by its presence.

These are just a few of many ideas I have. But without seriously changing the culture of the police in the US, none of these has a chance in hell of being adopted.",news,0

I was lucky that the police chief was our neighbor and he was so great with my kids (and all the neighborhood kids).

He'll have known for a while but saying it out loud will make it permanent. He'll realize his heroes, his teachers, his professors, and the people he learns from and respects are all atheists and think maybe there is a way to live and function without god, maybe it is possible to have morals and hope and so on without thinking constantly of the afterlife. He'll see how people, his peers, live happily and don't believe in god, and over the next few years realize that he never really did, either, and he never thinks about it again.

They got 'professional ass-wipers' in all the bathrooms, too? I mean, that would ensure a lot of 'lower class jobs', too, so why not?

Reminds me of when Milton Friedman toured China and saw men digging on public works' projects with shovels. He asked them: 'Why not use machinery?', to which the officials explained that men with shovels was less efficient and, therefore, allowed them to give more people jobs.

To which Friedman nodded and replied:

""Why not make them use spoons, then?""

When we die, we transcend time and go into the fourth. My theory isn't fully fleshed out yet but somehow god acts as gate keeper to the fourth, possibly because he is of the fifth dimension. Thus he can judge us and send us to heaven or hel for ""eternity"" until we go from the 4th to the 5th.
