"In my experience, there are some women that really do want a more assertive and 'traditionally masculine' guy.    The few that I've actually talked to seem to want a traditional 'feminine/submissive' role.. at least in some facets of their relationship.   


Most women don't look at it as an either-or choice.    There are degrees of 'masculinity' and 'control of a situation'.   It is a lot of 'grey' area.   

Everyone.. male and female wants a partner that is clear about what they want;   that actually takes positive steps to secure what they want;   and keeps the happiness & safety of their partner in mind when making these decisions.   
The pure 'alpha' makes these choices,  but often doesn't have enough compassion to accurately measure their partner's needs/wants.   

TL;DR..  it isn't about Alpha/Beta..  it is about being self-aware, asking for what you want, being honest about your feelings, and actually trying to make things change.  Nobody wants a wishy-washy whiner.... male or female.

"I'm not trying to argue with this whole ""5.5 inches is YUGE!!!"" and ""anything over 5.5 inches is painful and hurts anyways!""

I have a nice penis - I'm NOT bragging I just want some honest input.  I am around 8.5 inches long and 6.5 inches in circumference.

Many many many women I have dated have said ""that is too big!"" and some even declared it ""would not fit!"" and used similar claims about how ""Ocean in the motion, not the size of the boat.""  ""size doesn't matter!"" and ""Anything over 5 inches is basically a waste.""

I'm not going to lie, it makes ME feel like an outcast, and when you all claim this (sorry but it's bullshit) it puts me into the same position as the man who doesn't think he's big enough.  If I were to take advice from this page RIGHT HERE I am apparently NEVER going to find a woman that could or would even want to touch my giant gross arm dick...

This next part is purely anecdotal - but I have been with girls that were 100 lbs soaking wet, 5ft even, petite as hell, with a tiny little vagina and she had no issues with my penis.  I've had sex with a 44 year old woman who had been married to the same guy her whole life then he died tragically in a motorcycle accident, months later I cooked her dinner and dusted out the cobwebs for her, she told me as soon as she saw my penis ""Oh my, ya I can't do that, it looks painful."" and I've also dated the ""know it all"" 24 year old college graduate with studies in human sexuality tell me that my hideous penis would SCIENTIFICALLY provable to cause irreversible damage to the average vagina...  Not even kidding.

Here's the thing - every single one of these women slept with me, every single one of them LOVED it, Every single one of them said something along the lines of ""Whoever told me size didn't matter fucking lied..."" and even the science girl who was convicned I would literally BREAK her vagina just by going near it, when we broke up, her famous last words were ""This sucks, because I'm never going to find a dick like yours again..."" and I was like ""Wait so you only care that you're losing my dick?"" and she of course says ""Well no, I'm going to miss us, but goddamn that dick.... Can we do it one last time...""

I shit you not, it's just like the whole ""Beauty is on the inside!"" crew is technically correct, yet it seems to be the mantra of the externally unpleasant to actually employ.

I've never once had a woman (EVEN those women who claimed to have short vaginas, tight entrances, strange cervix shapes, etc) complain after having sex with my penis which according to you people here, should be sending women to the hospital in mass.

The only complaint I EVER have gotten is that they couldn't clone my penis and have a custom dildo along with exes that still contact me to this day saying ""Can we please just do it like once?  I haven't cum in years...""

As a side note, I'm sick of people in this sub claiming that some women ""just can't squirt."" that may be true for SOME women, but not MOST women.  Every single woman I've been with that had been trying to squirt their ENTIRE lives had a squirting orgasm by the third time we had sex in every single instance.  Including my current SO who had been trying to achieve a squirt with multiple ex's for years, let me repeat that, YEARS, she squirted about 3 minutes after I put my penis inside of her the VERY FIRST TIME we had sex.

Y'all just kinda suck at sex I think, hence why you all hang out in here all day.

"I live in Israel, where virtually everybody is circumcised (except for some Christians, which is ironic given that people here say that circumcision is a thing in the US). Over here, the problem is backwards- uncut dicks are so rare that women aren't used to them, making guys who have them feel self-conscious (to the point doing it later on in life for just that reason).

Full disclosure- circumcision tends to decrease penis sensitivity somewhat. The people to ask about this would be people who got cut later in life. I have a christian friend who did it and claims to not feel a significant difference (although he got cut for medical rather than social reasons, something about repeated infections), although he does feel some loss of sensation. Now, guys who got circumcised as infants' sensitivity isn't, in fact, 100% comparable to the sensitivity of guys who did it later in life. The healing process is much more complete in infants. So there's less sensory loss if you get cut as a baby. This means that the difference is there, sure, but it isn't gigantic. Much of it can be made up for with lube (either a woman's natural kind or not). Some of it can't.

Don't worry about, but mind the consequences if you decide to cut your kids, is what I'm trying to say. On a side note, circumcision isn't (only) this horrible ritual of infant-mutilation. It has a few minor health benefits. Nothing to merit hurting babies who don't have a say in the matter, but there are a few.",sex,1

Now the shoe is on the other foot and her husband seems to want some of the same hedonistic experiences that she enjoyed so much.

"> If you're saying your experimental design is rigorous enough to separate out biological immutables from culture, cool.

Speaking for myself, I have tried it in perhaps a half-dozen cultures, without discernible variation in results.  I am not a social scientist by training, so if you have some suggestions to improve my rigor, please, let me know.

> Were we just trying to prove that in the world we currently live in

I think every scientific experience ever, the hypothesis could have ""in the world we currently live in"" appended.  The speed of light is finite _in the world we currently live in_.  Aspirin relieves minor pain _in the world we currently live in_.

> women have an easier time propositioning strangers? 

_Successfully_ propositioning _male_ strangers, yes.

> Have you controlled for the fear of being murdered by someone physically stronger than you

Since the invention of firearms in the 14th century, the fear of being murdered has not been assuaged by size difference.

> how exactly do you know what's not culturally mediated?

As I said, by trying it different cultures.

Is it your theory that there is some culture where the experiment would turn out differently? 

> A century ago similar logic could have been used to argue with no greater rigor that women are biologically unsuited to high office.

In 1901, the British Empire was ruled by Queen Victoria, and the Empress Cixi sat on the throne of Qing China; those two women were sovereign over perhaps the half the population of the planet.  In 1917, the powers of the Presidency were exercised almost entirely by Edith Wilson.  Any educated person at the time would know of Livia Drusilla, the Empress Maud, Queen Elizabeth, Catherine de Medici, Trưng sisters, and Catherine the Great.

See, these are _counterexamples_.  You posed a theory that women could not serve in high office, and I produced actual cases that rebutted your theory.

Now I am posing a theory that women -- regardless of culture -- do not seek sex for itself, but instead for the things sex can bring: status, children, money, protection.

Now it's time for you point out a counterexample, some sizeable group of women who do or did seek sex for its own sake.",sex,1

"Circumcision definitely seems to affect some people more than others, this could be due to masturbation habits, how soft your boxers are etc. but I think also some people may not feel the difference as much as a lot of sexual enjoyment comes from mental stimulation as well thus why although a virgin may not actually be experiencing the world's most mindblowing orgasm they might cum really quickly because they're excited. 

I'm a little sad (0.025/10) about my boyfriend's circumcision as although I much prefer the looks and cleanliness it would be nice for him to have a bit more sensitivity, however there's no point being angry at you having been mutilated as you can't stop it now, you can however consider foreskin restoration or using various methods to dekeratinize, some include using scar sheets to cover the glans, or a condom with the tip cut out.

Why?  Just because it's not *technically* classified as an STD because you can get it other ways and on other parts of your body??  Which to me would make it even more of a reason to disclose it.  Wouldn't you want someone to tell you if they had a disease that you could get many different places on your body, that you could never get rid of, and could suffer outward signs and painful symptoms from, on a possibly regular basis, regardless of the form of transmission??


If you look up STDs you should protect yourself from, Herpes is always on the list.  AND, it's only second after HIV on most lists.

now. regarding any virginity. there's isn't anything particularly special about losing it. there can be, if a person is REALLY lucky. but even then, sexual/love experiences that precede that event tend to be more special. I lost mine at a very young ages, but the sex i had last week was filled with far more feelings and the like.
Point is, focus on your experience with her. the fact that she has had sex before is so completely irrelevant.
you are the only other person in the relationship and so you're only ever going to be competing with yourself. improving on what you have done previously.

now, the anal. MY ex was adamant, when we started dating, that she was never going to do it. the reason being was due to bad experiences in her past, and then previous bfs not taking it seriously and trying anyway. after some time together we did something that piqued her interest in the idea. this resulted in her researching it, a lot.
just because your gf has done it before, doesn't mean it was done right. could be that it was spare of the moment, no lube used and not as enjoyable as she'd like. And so she is researching it to make it more enjoyable with you.

Yea, kinda like the pull out method is ""easy to use."" It is easy to use. It's also easy to fuck up, and most people do.

Let me ask you a question, would you be comfortable using the pull out method as a form of birth control, ignoring STDs? If not, then the female condom isn't the right choice for you.

The female condom is less effective than the pull out method in typical and perfect use. That means if you're doing it right, pulling out would protect you better than the female condom.

That means if you start including things like ""ahh fuckit, it feels too good! I'm going to cum in you!"" and getting pregnant as a ""failure"" of the pull out method, the female condom STILL protects you less!

The female condom is a decent back up BC method. If you want to rely on it for BC though, remember that it's less effective than pulling out, even when you count NOT pulling out as a failure for pulling out.

 One of my oldest buddies, the morning after this messy but cathartic night, gently tells me that at least I know now, and that I can finally begin to deal with it and move on. Confused, I tell him that I know breaking up sucks, but that my boyfriend had been distant and treating me badly in recent months so I knew it was for the best. Cue my buddy getting awkward and weird.. so I had to drag it out of him.

As it turned out, two months prior, my boyfriend had hooked up with his ex - at a party I HAD been at, but left at 2am while he continued partying. Not only was my ol' buddy aware though, my two best friends, my flatmate and a handful of other friends had known the entire time. And no one had told me, because the scheming ex and my boyfriend had told everyone they had talked it out with me that day and told me the truth. 2 months of everyone acting strangely around me because the two scumbags told everyone they would own up to it. They never did.

**Bonus points:** His ex came up to me earlier on that night, waaaaaasted, and told me that if I ever was having trouble with him, that she had been there and I could talk to her. That she really respects me and is there for me. Nawwww, how lovely. Conniving bitch didn't even remember telling me that when I kindly pointed it out to her later.

I think you are very, very deluded about what most people find turn-offs and dealbreakers. I think you should spend more time outside of this sub, because this statement doesn't reflect reality. Try ""some"": ""some won't care"". That would be accurate.  

> but I don't like the fact that she enjoys sex""

> Second, once you get past your current age, no one will give a shit about how many guys you bang.   

Again, totally false. Plenty of guys do care, just like plenty of girls care. I know girls who don't want a guy who slept around a lot and I know guys who don't want a girl who slept around. Because they feel the value the other person puts on sex is too different from the value they put on it. If you see sex as something you only do in a committed relationship, as many people do, then you'll think somebody who has been around the block a lot is incompatible with you. So again, the word you're looking for is: ""some"". ""Some will not give a shit"". Learn the difference.

"Inb4 downvotes.  Doesn't sound like rape.

> I told him to at least go get a condom because I wanted to be careful and reminded him I wasn't on the pill anymore.

This is verbal consent to sex (albeit sex with a condom).

> He didn't though. And he started having sex with me.

What?  Your skipping some key details here...

How did you not notice that he didn't get a condom?  Normally that would involve getting off the bed, unwrapping the condom, putting it on his penis, etc.   How did he start having sex with you without you noticing that he did none of this?  

Assuming you did notice... why not stop him here?  You said he didn't use any force.  Unless you were lying spread eagle with your eyes closed, I find it extremely difficult to believe he was able to penetrate you against your will without using force.

So we're at a situation where you KNOW he didn't get a condom, and you position your body in a way that allows penetration anyway.  This is not exactly consent, but it's definitely not indicative of somebody trying to prevent intercourse.

> I didn't push him away

Why not?  Were you frozen with fear?  That can certainly happen to rape victims, but that isn't what this sounds like to me.

> I'm mostly concerned because in between those no-s I was still moaning and kind of enjoying it.

... Oh okay, so not frozen with fear.

> It doesn't feel like rape, because it was him, I had sex with him before and it's not like he really had to use force to have sex with me.

Rape doesn't necessarily mean it was forced, but this doesn't feel or sound like rape because it wasn't.  It sounds like you had sex without a condom and regretted it later.  I'm sorry this happened to you, but rape is a serious thing and an enormous accusation to make.

&gt;So I cooked, dishes, baths, and I puts the kids to sleep. Told her take a shower and when she was done she came to lay down and I kinda jumped her. It's been almost a month.

Notice the amount of chore play you did.  Fits exactly what I said above.

At my age, I'm a cynic.  While sex shouldn't be instant on (especially after a few years and a few kids), it also shouldn't be where you have to do the ""housework Olympics"" only to be told that you only did that to have sex and, therefore, no sex.",sex,0

"Uh... I don't know? I moved in with my boyfriend at 18 so I assume they know. And... I mean I've been here like 6 years now, so... 

My parents never really talked to me about sex at all either. I just got the talk from school. I think I remember them asking me when I was about 13 when the school was going to teach sex ed. I think I responded with ""this quarter"" or something. They looked very relieved when I told them that. And I went on the pill at 15 for cramps. 

The closest thing they have ever come to acknowledging that I have a sex life was one time my mom made an off the cuff joke about it. It was something pretty stupid too like I said something that I dont remember and she said something like ""Yeah on top... Of JAMES."" (James is the boyfriend.)

"This is definitely a question for a doctor.  The vagina is amazingly elastic; if you have sex with her immediately after a really large toy or other partner, you would likely notice a difference... but maybe not.

Whenever I finger my wife, it's often difficult to work that first finger in.  Yet once that happens, she can easily stretch to accommodate two, three, four fingers with no issue.  We even do some fisting on an occasional basis (maybe once or twice in a given month) - and I don't have small hands.

Yet I can have sex with her the same night after fisting, and if it's not just immediately after, I honestly can't tell the difference.  The next day, I'm back to having to work that first finger in.  

Remember, the vagina is designed to stretch quite a bit - up to and including giving birth.  Sure, that takes some prep, but that capacity is there - stretchiness is not at all related to a lack of tightness overall.

"Hello xvirwlknsn!

The fact that she has these fantasies is, independent of anything else, entirely normal.  The ripped gentleman on the front of romance novels rarely asks for consent; she's hardly the member of an insignificant minority in having these fantasies.

Re: her being a survivor, this could represent the opportunity for her to get at reclaiming/re-enacting a traumatic experience on her terms.  Per Psmpo's incredibly insightful comment below, it could be the sheer emotional intensity and terror of her being assaulted: we're always told that the erotic lights up parts of our brains near fear centers--she has a massive reserve of fear that it could be thrilling for her to tap into in some controlled way.  I think that her experiencing panic attacks 

I've been in long-term relationships with survivors of sexual assault and abuse, and stuff like this often comes up, whether it's rape play or just watching Twin Peaks and SVU.

As far as you're concerned, OP, I'd encourage you to consider your needs and sense of security around doing this.  Just because she's down doesn't mean you have to be, or even that you can be.  There were times when I was role playing a situation like this with my partner and I had to tap out because it rattled me.  Finally, I'd invite you to hold in your mind that *her telling you this is a reflection of her being comfortable with you taking on a role of immense terror and power in her life, and the fact that she trusts you to do so makes you the essential opposite of her assailant.*",sex,0

"I've actually heard this is a thing, that some guys just start masturbating in an odd way and never end up switching to 'normal'. 

Sometimes certain things they try can be dangerous, although humping pillows doesn't sound like you'll hurt yourself. A friend of mine told me when he was young his mate would ask him to sit on his back while he humped the mattress to get off, cause the extra weight would make it feel better cause of the extra pressure.

But anyway!! I think it's not extremely rare, and you can probably quite easily switch to regular masturbation. If you have internet and privacy you can always look up 'solo male'  (only if you're over 18 though!) and although you might not enjoy what you see it could be educational, I wouldn't be surprised if there was educational ones around tbh haha. :) If you're not keen on that look up chicks giving guys hand jobs, although porn is rarely close to reality, it still might help?

"An orgasm is much more difficult to achieve for a lot of woman compared to men. That overwhelming feeling was it coming on and it was likely because his penis was hitting your g-spot (which is located about two inches inside on the roof of your vagina). Good ways to hit it during sex are missionary with your hips elevated by: ankles up, pillows under your hips, anything that elevates your hips. Also you can try having sex with you on top and controlling the movement that feels the best and doing that until orgasm. The easiest way I have seen women achieve orgasm is by clitoral stimulation. This can be achieved by smooth, repetitive motions on the clit, whether it's by your own fingers, humping a pillow, his fingers or his tongue, it all works. Don't change rhythm or you may lose the orgasm.  Don't be scared of that overwhelming feeling either. Let yourself go and be yourself, moan, scream and squirm, let it happen. I am sure your man will be very happy to do whatever it takes to get you there. 

This is just a guys perspective from experience and I hope it helps!",sex,0

"It very much sounds like it.
Sexuality is very complicated thing, so don't let it stress you out.
You sound as though you are young, so you have plenty of time to explore and figure things out. 
You could have a low libido, your body could just decide it's horny when it's drunk, it could be a sensation you are only just waking up to. Everyone is at some point of a vast spectrum.
Alcohol lowers inhibitions, people become more relaxed than normal, this is probably why there is a difference between sober you and drunk you.
When you think about it, and remember him and the way he made you feel, does the feeling come back? Do you want it to?
Relax, explore yourself and the world and remember not to judge yourself.
Sexual feelings are ok, so is not often experiencing them, so is not experiencing them at all, as long as you are happy.

"There is multiple ways to record video without software triggering no recording/saving safeguards,  in software packages.   Verification of non-recording can be falsified. 

One can,  with great difficulty,  record/view a stream they should not be privy to.   Easy way to ensure people snooping can not view the video is to make sure the connection to your partner is encrypted, otherwise is is possible to tap the broadcast and view it.   It takes access that most people do not have.   Biggest threat would be someone with your WiFi password hacking the transmission (Or theirs!).   It is not common,  it takes training/education but it can be done.   One reason I say never do anything financial or sensitive on public or widely shared WiFi, without peer to peer encryption in effect. 

The biggest threat is the person you're intending to cam with.   Ask yourself how trustworthy are they.   Have you ever caught them in a lie?   Have you ever met them real life?   Do you have mutual friends?    It comes down to how much you trust the person on the other side of the video.   They can record your steam and exclude theirs.    There have been many videos posted online of girlfriends,  wives etal who stream/send a nude or sexual video to some they trusted loved at one point and where betrayed. 

I have shared intimate moments online with someone I cared for via video,  I've sexted yatter yatter.   So yes if you trust them with this gift,  and are willing to take the risk go ahead,  but also understand what is being risked.    Everybody might be able to see it if things go wrong.

If you stay with her and don't change anything about your sexual relationship, no.

**Dealing with your conundrum.**

I know I just laid out a no-win situation. The problem is that the two of you don't sound sexually compatible. I don't sense any underlying problems besides her preferences not matching yours, but that is a problem on its own. Some couples resolve this problem by agreeing to an open relationship. Most couples just break up and find partners they're more compatible with. There's nothing wrong with ending a relationship that's just going to lead to a r/deadbedrooms post.

Whatever you do, your first move at this point should be to talk to her. Tell her how you feel when she refuses to try new sexy stuff with you. Tell her why you want to go down on her. Let her tell you why she doesn't want you to go down on her. Get emotional with her. Let her get emotional with you. This should be an all-out feel-the-feels festival.

I don't think it's a good idea to give her a deadline, but you might mention that a year sounds difficult to you. Mentally make a note of what you think is a reasonable amount of time to wait, and bring it up again later, not in a nagging or pressuring way, but ""hey, can we have a check in about the status of our relationship and/or sex life?""

If you don't trust your partner enough to believe them when they say ""I got tested,"" then you don't trust them enough to go no condom. Seeing their results should ABSOLUTELY not stand in as proof that they're clean. If someone were to tell me that they didn't trust their previous partners enough to believe them when they got tested, and instead relied on the papers as verification, I would absolutely consider them irresponsible and at high risk for having something. I would feel MUCH more comfortable with a partner who said ""I always talked about sti's with my partner and waited to not use a condom until I trusted them enough to not use one."" not ""I didn't trust my previous partners, but I got verification of it so I'm good."" no, you're not good.

Basically my ex had this same issue but instead of not finishing he'd finish almost instantly bc it was so sensitive and so much for him. I honestly didn't mind it we'd just then spend a lot of time on foreplay and i never wanted him to feel inadequate or less masculine bc it seemed out of his control. about a year in though he's frustrated that he's not going longer even if he finishes before i come over, so he began doing research and went to his doctor.

Pretty instant relief, he got medicine to help stretch it and over the course of months I'd help him with it. after some time he went back to the doctors and they could see he had at some point injured the head of his d and his foreskin and head created a thin skin that kept them connected incorrectly. one brief surgery later and he was then fully able and comfortable and went much longer. 

its an awkward conversation but saves them so much psychological and physical pain. he would get hurt in certain positions too and it was nice to finally have him then experience sex pain-free. plus if your boyfriend starts looking into it it could be revealed that there's more going on and causing problems, as with my ex. he was about 21-22 when he realized all this so it's certainly an issue adults can have and i wasnt his first partner so you can see how it can be difficult for someone to figure it out that it's a medical problem and not just them doing something wrong.

I mean, I agree with you, but we can't force anyone to do something they don't want to do.

To avoid being a complete bummer, I'm gonna rattle off some ideas:

* Go into the bedroom, leave the lights on, and show him your pussy. Show him the inner and outer labia, the mons, where the hair is, the clit, the clitoral hood, where he puts his dick when you fuck, and show him what you do when you masturbate. In general, knowledge is power. He might not like what it looks like, at first, but realizing he puts his dick in there every day could help.
* Next time he says that he'll ""try to do it more,"" ask him how you can help. Ask him if it smells funny, tastes funny, looks funny. I mean, there isn't much you can do about looks funny, and I'm also guessing you're clean, but at least acknowledge that your pussy is an acquired taste.
* This is slightly guilt tripish, but talk to him about your acclimation to sucking cock. Tell him that you need to fight your gag reflex and that semen is an acquired taste. But then finish that story by telling him how you've learned to love it because sucking cock represents you giving of yourself entirely to him, and that you've actually become wet from thinking of cock sucking alone.

You've got this. Good luck!",sex,0

As to whether it'll get better in a relationship, I can only provide you with an anecdote. My ex was by no means perfect, there were little things about her that I didn't find attractive (ie. slightly crooked teeth) but as we got closer and I gradually fell in love with her, my feelings toward them changed. I found them endearing, they were a part of what made her who she was, and I couldn't help but love every part of her. ",sex,0

"Hey, when I was 18 I started dating a 24 year old guy (now 19 with the same dude). Our sex life wasn't perfect from the start, but it sure as hell wasn't anything like yours. He would ask me if what he was doing was okay/ good for me to figure out what I liked. He would ask me whether I wanted to have sex with him at that moment and even gave me time during to stop any and all action because he knew I had had bad experiences in the past. He always respects my decisions and he always asks whether or not he gets to touch my butt. He really wants to do anal but I haven't felt comfortable enough so even after a year of not fulfilling his wish, he sticks to my boundaries and it's his interest to never hurt me. 
He's not the best at foreplay and sometimes it's okay not to do any for me, but if it hurts he stops and comforts me. He feels bad when he accidentally hurts me, and would never do it on purpose. I trust him with choking me and I trust him with fingering my butt because I know he cares about my feelings and consent. He asks whether or not I enjoyed myself, he asks whether or not I'm up for his kinks and eases me into it when I am. I know what it's like to be told from everyone that you're making bad decisions and your partner is a piece of shit while you disagree, but please girl. It gets so much better when you get out of situations like yours. I'm not good at being blunt but honestly, you're making ridiculous excuses for his shitty behavior and you have zero reason to stay with him anymore. Some people don't have the skills, for example my SO will often accidentally hurt me during foreplay because he doesn't know my body like I do, but your SO is bad at empathy and respect. Without respect, there's no possibility of healthy sex. I've had a sex life similar to yours for 2 years and the best thing I've ever done was to dump that piece of shit and move on with someone who makes me feel safe, and valued, and respected, and powerful, and equal to him.

"You're under the assumption here that every guy/girl can take a polite no and move on with their lives. My bad experiences with guys and girls (bisexual female here) in these situations have literally caused an aversion to me meeting people at bars and clubs because of how aggressive it can be. 

I have had guy friends pin me to their bed at house parties trying to fuck me even though I clearly said ""No, I am not interested in having sex with you."" I have had girls grab my entire body and force their faces onto mine on a dancefloor without me even seeing where the fuck they came from to begin with. On average, if I went out every weekend (which I don't anymore because I'm 24 now and way past doing all that), I would have one bad experience a night minimum. 

This is never going to be an issue of people not saying no politely enough but rather how the receive responds to a 'no' instead. I do want to say though that I have seen cases where people don't say no or are too vague in which case I can understand the misunderstanding but even in those cases, examples I gave are not warranted. You can't pin me to the bed if my body language is clearly uncomfortable and defensive. And you certainly shouldn't go grabbing people on the dance floor trying to suck their face without prior warning. 

I'll also add that I have had very many pleasant encounters where I have said 'no thanks' and the receiver was more than happy to move on. So the good ones do exist but the bad ones are more scarring emotionally and thus are foreshadowed in my memories to be aware of. ",sex,0

You may feel this was OK because he was your boyfriend and in the end you enjoyed it, but as an objective reader, this says ""rape"" to me.

"The issue with your logic is that it could be applied to anything.  Every possible issue has positives and negatives.  If you focus on the negatives without balancing them against the positives, of course it seems degenerate.  If you're focusing on the distorted images in the media and pornography then your conclusions are going to be equally distorted.  Garbage in, garbage out.  Yes, sex does cause many people pain, but it also brings many people joy.  Not degenerate joy, but meaningful and lasting happiness.  It can be an expression of love, a cementing of affection, a celebration of mutual pleasure, or even just an affirmation that we deserve to feel good sometimes.  Pleasure has value for its own sake.

Your post reminds me of how I used to feel, although not specifically about sex.  I spent a couple years feeling really shitty and not going anywhere with my life.  I wanted to do something, but the thought of doing it filled me with an anxiety I couldn't explain.  I took on nihilistic beliefs that justified my inaction.  After all, there was so much suffering in the world that I couldn't do anything about, everybody was just going to die, and the planet was eventually going to be consumed by the sun, so what did any of it matter?  I was paralyzed by the inevitability of disappointment and pain.  

I went to see a therapist finally, and I dug down and got to the core belief behind all of this, and it wasn't anything about the world.  It was about me.  I didn't believe I *deserved* to feel good.  I thought that it was not ok for me to be happy when so many suffered so horribly.  That's wrong, though.  Yes, the world is awful, but the world is also great.  Yes, there is so much I cannot control, but there is a little corner of the world that I can.  Rather than abdicate that power because it wasn't enough, my responsibility was to do whatever I could to make that little corner as good as I could.  And, I was part of that corner.  Rather than making my corner better through suffering, I was dragging everyone down with me.

So, yes, sex is messy and uncontrolled and distorted and sensationalized and painful and scary.  It's all of those things.  But, life is all of those things, too.  Life is degenerate.  We are degenerate animals that eat, shit, fuck, and die just like every other animal.  If you hide in your room (metaphorically) and build up walls to keep the world out all you have done is wall yourself up with all that pain and fear and blocked out any of the happiness.  Because ultimately, the thing you fear is your own animal nature that longs for transitory and meaningless pleasure in a meaningless existence.  But that's all we get, and it's enough.",sex,0
