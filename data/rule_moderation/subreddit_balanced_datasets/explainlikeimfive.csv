The [temperature record is basically useless](https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/surfacestationsreport_spring09.pdf) and this fearmongering ""end of days"" crap has been going on for decades and has NEVER manifested itself.  The very minor effect CO2 has on weather is not even worth mentioning.

The reason everyone thinks it's getting hotter is because local temperatures in cities is increasing due to more cement, more cars, more AC's, etc. that all produce heat and create a *localized* warming effect.  Any temperature measurements that aren't taken out in the uninhabited woods miles away from any roads or civilization do not accurately reflect the aggregate global temperature as humans only inhabit a [very small area](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-do99S8xbr5A/Ugloe5JYeLI/AAAAAAAAE0E/iod_S22RWN8/s1600/New+Zealand.jpg) relative to the vast uninhabited (by humans) land.

Most of your perception is tainted the agenda-driven false narrative spewing Left and complicit/colluding media who use the charge of racism to denigrate anyone and everyone who does not believe the way they believe. Charges of racism is used by the minorities to excuse their anti-social behavioral patterns, like car-jackings and home invasions. They actually tried to get a law passed to prevent police from chasing them if they flee and now they're even going so far as to have our govt do away with police officers altogether. Can you imagine the hell that would unfold if minorities ceased to be chased and arrested for their crimes? Grow up. Study after study has shown that by far the segment of the population that is most racist is the segment that cries racism the most often. Blacks. They are the worst when it comes to racism against other races. Black males have often attacked white males if those white males are seen with a black woman. Never heard of such a thing before? That's because the media is hiding these crimes from you. They're hiding all of the black crimes from Americans.

One was because, as a non-black student in a school of mostly black students, I would be an easy to locate target for his friends until it blew over. Grudges never really lasted that long in my middle school. 

Two was because it was supposed to be a wake-up call for me since I was having issues controlling myself when someone harassed me (not trying to sound like I was a little badass. I wasn't, it was just a rough period in my life and I didn't handle it very well).

And three was more for the other kid than me, he had already been suspended several times that year and was close to failing again because of it, so he needed to learn to straighten up or risk being held back again. Spoiler alert: it didn't work.

"When you light a piece of paper it gives off a lot of heat and a little light, right? But you can't just snap your fingers and get that paper to ignite. It requires an initial energy bump to climb to a high enough temperature to ignite in that fashion. So we use something that has a much lower ""chemical activation energy"" - the little toothed wheel scraping iron filings and lighting the butane of our lighter, or the different chemicals in a match that ignite when exposed to friction - to get us that extra bump.

Well, nuclear activation energy is a LOT higher. It requires a HUGE amount of pressure and temperature to start the fission (where heavy atoms are split apart) process, with different amounts required for different types of atoms. So you have to build a bomb around the core radioactive part of the bomb, and that outer bomb layer blasts the inside bomb layer inward with enough force and power to deliver that nuclear ""activation energy"". 

It's even harder when you're talking fusion bombs (where light atoms are combined). Then you need a fission bomb as the ""outer"" layer to deliver enough energy to squeeze and heat the hydrogen enough to start fusing. ",explainlikeimfive,1

"Estrogen. It's a hormone mainly for women. The body starts pumping it out like crazy during puberty. It signals the body depositing fats among other things. It's it tells the body to deposit fat tissue in the breasts, butt, and thigh (mostly) the breasts are obvious but as to why the butt, my theory is that because women typically have stronger lower body in comparison to men. The reason this is mainly a female issue is because men don't really have much estrogen. Men have SOME but it stays constant through out their entire lives. But men do have another hormone called testosterone that's more dominant than estrogen. It's what gives men rapid lisle development, hair growth, deeper voice, and all the other male characteristics you can think of including some psychological, like dominance, anger, violence, and feeling as if they're the protector. But when the male body is low on testosterone (diet, exercise, age affect it) the estrogen in the body takes more of an effect. That's why obese men developed breasts and can even lactate.

"As a diver, I've learned a lot about how the volume of a gas is affected by pressure, and I think some of it might be applicable here. Let me explain how it works for a diver with a breath of air in their lungs:

Let's say you have 6 liters of air, that air being made up of a billion individual molecules of gases like Oxygen, Nitrogen, and others. Now you start diving. 

As you dive, there will be more and more weight pressing down on you, and compacting any air that was previously at surface pressure. So, if you're holding your breath (**DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH WHILE DIVING**), you'd still have that billion molecules in there, but you'd steadily be decreasing the volume those molecules took up. At around 10m depth, you'll have enough water pressure above you to double the pressure that you're used to experiencing - and when the pressure doubles, the volume halves. So, that billion molecules is now only taking up 3 liters of space. (Which, neither here nor there, is why you don't hold your breath under water, if you surface too quickly with lungs full of air, that air could expand and pop you.)

Interestingly, this is a logarithmic progression - so when you get to 2 atmospheres, the volume is 1/2 of what it was; at 3 atmospheres, 1/3; at 4, 1/4; etc...For the sake of this conversation, this matters because the vast majority of volume fluctuation takes place closer to the initial pressure state. As such, it doesn't take the drastic pressure changes one experiences diving under water to feel substantial portions of these effects in pressurized environments - think of your ears popping on a plane or as you drive up a mountain. 

I had a sliding glass window replaced this summer (mower-related, shame-inducing), and, in the process of replacing the single pane of the double pane that I broke, the installer said that he'd do his best to get as much of the air out as possible, but achieving a perfect vacuum was really hard to achieve...which may have been his way of pre-justifying the obnoxious spot of condensation that haunts the center of it now...but does point to the fact that achieving a perfect vacuum is a challenge when you're opening up an otherwise closed system. 

So, think about e.g. a knee surgery. These are areas that aren't generally exposed to any air, being in the body, where everything is pretty much wet. Even doing your best to vacuum the air up on your way out of whatever surgery is being performed, there are almost certain to be a few bubbles of gas that get trapped, right? (I have no source, here, just guessing). Knowing what we know about how pressure affects volume, even at small pressures, and assuming that there are some bubbles trapped in those surgically repaired areas, I'd wager that the majority of what these people are feeling is the expansion of those tiny bubbles.

I was diving with a guy once who had what turned out to be a very small cavity in his tooth. He said that it felt kinda funny on the way down, but started to throb painfully on the way up. We'd gone to 30m, and at 10m he was becoming disoriented, the pain was so intense. When we got to the top he was literally screaming, and couldn't figure out what the issue was. His dentist, also a diver, later explained that pressurized air had been jammed into the cavity at 4x normal pressure while we were down there, and as we surfaced, that air expanded at a rate exceeding that by which it could escape from the cavity - causing massive pressure on the nerve. 

I hope someone actually scientific answers, though, this is cross-application of knowledge, and that's always suspect...",explainlikeimfive,1

It could be that the CEO set things up for the criminal behavior. If a significant amount of sales people were unable to meet their goals, and so used illegal means to meet those goals, it might be argued that the CEO set up things so that criminal behavior resulted. You see this kind of thing most frequently in manufacturing, where if quotas are set high enough that you can't actually complete them within the laws, you break them.

"fun fact: my friend and I got suspended for betting on MTG games in the cafeteria during a block of 1.5 hours dedicated to ""go find a quiet spot in the school and study"" well, we did that. we studied the meta game of Magic The Gathering in order to increase our odds with being more equipped to bet properly on the game of; Magic the Gathering.

so we got suspended for a week and during that week; we logged into our Everquest accounts and played nonstop with 1 goal: farm as many Idol of the Thorned as possible (Kunark expansion; so roughly around 2000). This item was the only item of its type and slot that gave Armor Class as a stat (AC) whilst being sell-able/drop-able. They sold for around 20K-platinum a piece at the time, which when we were trying to sell as much plat as possible on ebay/playerauctions (so we were selling for less time-profit than the competition), which meant for each Idol we gained roughly $215 and we would switch off and on for farming shifts.

When he was farming the idol I would be raiding with my guild and vice versa. So in the span of our suspension he made $718 and I earned roughly $832 (on the 8th day, so my first day back). I used that money to buy a shit used card so I could say fuck it to being lame and taking the bus. Now I was just being lame with the car I drove, but my everquest money paid for it so i didn't give a shit.

My economics teacher asked where me and my friend were during the week. Thankfully nothing really was missed for school work or of anything of real worth in terms of work, but we explained things to him, including the suspension and how we made money and with which way we did it. It also worked out in terms of timing, we were coming up on the exam for the following week and he told us we were to get bonus points and our example used in class as a way to think about your time investment. Our grades were bumped 1 letter grade. Principle was none-to-happy, but talked to us individually and found out it was for the best, but that we can't gamble or do that stunt again or it actually would be escalated.

But you are too nervous to talk to her (banned/blocked site/want to shitpost).

So you ask your friend Tim to go tell her you think she's pretty (Tim will be your proxy).

Jenny says she thinks your cute (jenny is the website you want to access)

She tells that to Tim and Tim then tells you (proxy passes information back to you the requestor).

For art GCSE, a group of us went to the Tate Modern in London to see some of the art that was there. One of the most unusual pieces was a canvas that was simply black - nothing else about it. It was literally just a black canvas. Yet one of the main interpretations about it is that it represents the emptiness one might feel in their soul from time to time.

It doesn't just have to be paintings or sculptures: one artist laid out a massive sheet of music and let pigeons do their business all over it.

Over 400 and warming is going to happen even if we shut down all industry now.

When you jump from a plane, you're *accelerating as you fall*.  There is a limit to how fast you can fall in gravity, called terminal velocity.  Jumping from a 10 story building, you don't have the time or distance to accelerate nearly as fast as jumping out of a plane. 

That's why I said there are many variables.  the 1000ft is the limit for  a standard parachute, if you're traveling at terminal velocity.

"No offence, friend, but yours is an extremely simplistic explanation that completely leaves out one very important thing: the human factor. People will lie and cheat their way out of any situation if there's money to be made. Thus, I'd argue that lobbying is simply legalized bribery, period.

There's no way, in this day and age, to prevent the lobbyists from exerting undue influence on lawmakers, who are also people, so they'll vote the way that makes most sense politically (i.e. to stay in office as long as possible), and not necessarily in the way best suited for their voters.

Another component of the problem is that lobbying places corporations who have means massively above those of the ordinary citizen to wield their influence, so for that perspective, the system is also unfair. Why would Apple get more of a say as to which way the gavel falls than you and me?

Lastly, one example comes to mind that contradicts your explanation: with marijuana legalisation coming up for vote in states left and right, the alcohol industry is using it's lobbyists to prevent that from happening (i.e. mj being legalized).

"What replaced dial-up was faster connections directly to your home.

If you're lucky and you live in a major city, you might have a choice of a new fiber connection. But it's very expensive to set that up - approximately $1000/home to run a new wired connection of any kind.

So what could AOL do? The only infrastructure they had was lots of dial-up modems around the country. That didn't help them provide broadband even if they wanted to.

Of course, there are a lot of other reasons they failed. They could have transformed their business in some way to stay successful - maybe by partnering with cable or phone companies, or by becoming a hosting company instead.

But they didn't - they just kept milking their existing customers for money for as long as they could and never really did anything new.

"Programming languages are distinguished by their level. There are high-level languages, and low-level languages. Neither is better than the other, they're simply different.

For some people, it might be easier to grasp low-level languages. These are languages that have you control the computer hardware more or less directly. The lowest level is machine code, which is the code that your CPU is physically built to implement.

Basically, your CPU is built that there are some things you can request it to do, and it does them, because engineers are clever and have made CPU like that. You can for example tell CPU to store a number in a register. CPU has plenty of registers like that. It also can do basic arithmetic with these numbers, and it has concept of fetching commands from memory, and you can manipulate the memory and where to fetch the next command. This may or may not sound clearer and easier to understand than the language you're actually programming in.

Now, regardless, you're probably not operating with such low-level language, since we're busy people and if I want to have computer write my name on the screen or something, I wouldn't want to have to start out by having to describe what exactly are letters, and how to draw them. So here come high-level languages.

High-level languages basically are built on top of low-level ones(hence the names, low and high level). They have things in them that don't really correspond to any physical thing in hardware, like, you know, letters. You have plenty of abstract stuff like that which is easier for humans to understand, but this makes it more difficult to see the connection between actual computer hardware and the code you write.

The point in languages that you use is that they provide you with some intuition about what's going on when you instruct the computer to do something. Like dealing with variables, there are man-made rules about how you should use variables, and these are supposed to be intuitive and easy to understand. Some programming languages succeed at this goal better than the others, but ultimately it's just bunch of arbitrary rules where each instruction you give to the computer is supposed to have clear result that you can anticipate.

So if you're not understanding why things are they way they are... They are the way they are so that you would have easier time understanding what your program does and how it does it. It's just bunch of rules similar to ""Simon says"". ""Simon says you store number 42 and retrieve it to me if I ask for variable A"", or in C++,

"Think of living things like complicated machines, with lots of little gears and screws and springs that all work in tandem to make...something. Anyway, you could make that machine out of wood. It's possible. But it'll take many, many hours of delicate carving and when you're done you have to be careful with the machine because it could rot, insects could eat it, etc. Metal is a better material to build the machine out of because it's strong, durable, and easy to shape. The building materials matter in order to ensure the long-term functionality of the machine.

So back to your question, in order for something to be alive it needs certain properties. These properties are very vague and all encompassing, because life really is quite varied, but they boil down to basic things like breeding, and burning fuel, and genetically adapting to outside pressures. But in order to fulfill these functions, you need basic fundamental chemicals that can do the job. That can ensure breeding, that can act as a good framework for living processes to occur, materials that can react and materials that are solid and inert and don't fall apart when they're under stress. Like our machine, if you use the wrong material at best the living thing is fragile, and it's more likely than not it will just fall apart. For carbon specifically, it acts as a scaffolding that living things can build on and add to to create functional molecules. It's just at the right elemental configuration to be one of the best atoms to make a molecular scaffolding. Everything else would have various functional problems like they couldn't build into three dimensions, limiting the structures you can make, or they react too easily and just destroy whatever you're trying to build.

"Your questions are full of generalizations so I will give you a generalized answer.

The word ""Nigger"" is almost always offensive, regardless of race. It is a trigger word with long, ugly history. You are most likely confusing it with ""Nigga"" which, while essentially the same word, is markedly different in meaning and intensity. ""Nigga"" is a reclaimed version of the word. Its use devalues the meaning of the original word while its exclusivity limits its prevalence. It's a way for the black community to ""take the word back"" from those who would use it with racist intentions and make it their own.

Some black people don't appreciate being called nigga while others do. Some allow it's use from a friend but not from a stranger. Everyone is different. In some circles, non-black minorities will throw the word around without a second thought. Whites can't use it because they are the reason the offensive word is so prevalent in the first place. This stems from hundreds of years of racism.

To put it into perspective, a white person may revel in being called a redneck from his white friend. A black man calling him a redneck may be construed as an insult. Redneck can mean life-loving country boy or backwoods, uneducated racist. It comes down to two things: who is saying it and the context. The same diversity goes for the word ""nigga"".

Gun control is simply the government regulating or controlling something that is key to standing up to a tyranical government, this is authortarian. However allowing the PEOPLE to have the FREEDOM of having guns to protect themselves from government is by logic a libertarian idea. 





When you are talking about the ""right to live"", you are simply just talking about one person killing another. Murder. This isn't to do with the government killing someone, this is the government not taking away particular weapons, which is authortarian as it empowers the state and regulates people socially. 






The reasons why people such as the republicans are FOR gun control is because they're traditionalists. Most of their voters simply like guns, guns are deeply embedded into US culture. The polititians themselves probably also just like guns and simply aren't extreme enough to attack their own people anyway so it doesn't give the state an advantage. The reason why most ""liberals"" want gun control is because most ""liberals"" aren't traditionalists, because most ""liberals"" are young and are also not super extremeists so see the trade off between having protection against the state and not having the freedom to bare arms as a good one.

"You're comparing the wrong things.

The aspect ratio and resolution of video is like the sampling rate and bit depth of audio, (which *do* have standards).

In terms of loudness for each TV show and movie, there is essentially a maximum level they can have but it's more complicated than that. 

Real sounds that happen in the world around you are at all sorts of different levels. Some TV shows and movies try to replicate that because it sounds more natural. Some on the other hand just want your attention. So they used audio compression. 

Audio compression is like a penguin that stands next to your stereo. He has a set of headphones and listens to your audio just before it gets to you. You pick a certain level and tell the penguin, if the audio is about to exceed some level, turn it down so that it doesn't and then turn it back up when it gets quiet again.

The result is a audio stream that has very little variation in the level. The problem is if you take the whole thing and then bring it up towards the max level of the system, you end up with an audio stream that while technically is within the limits, it *sounds* louder to human ears because more of the signal is up at that higher level compared to other TV shows and natural sounds. 

It's basically a trick TV commercials use to get your attention.

By having a lot of people who can see what other people are doing. Paying off one person in each step of the voting process is not enough to make any meaningful impact. At most it appears as a statistical anomaly, which may or may not be enough to warrant an 'investigation'.

Voting policies also vary from state to state in terms of the requirements and information needed. You don't just 'corrupt the voting system'. To really corrupt our first world voting system, you need to disrupt on a local level in many, many states.

Plus there will always be a money trail you can follow if there is corruption and somebody is being paid off, but these sort of things have to be caught by people who manage the financing and budgets of these people/companies.

Rich, powerful people are not inherently bad. Just as much as some rich people may try to undermine our democratic system, there are just as many rich people with genuine incentives to see a fair process. Also as long as we can keep as much people working on each level of the voting process, the likelihood of corruption 'sneaking' through the system is largely unfounded.",explainlikeimfive,0

"The six scenarios where the 2-health minion die only count two hits against that minion. There's no third phantom hit after two hits. In order to account for that in the math, I multiply by 1 after there have been two hits since we know there's a 100% chance the missiles won't hit the dead minion.

Perhaps a better way of listing it out would have been like this:

1. XX
2. XOX
3. XOOX
4. OXX
5. OXOX
6. OOXX

Since we only care about whether there are two Xs, we don't really need to calculate anything beyond that.

In any case, the math comes out the same:

1. 1/9 chance of hitting X twice in a row off the bat (1/3 * 1/3)
2. 2/27 chance of hitting X, missing X, hitting X (1/3  * 2/3 * 1/3)
3. 4/81 chance of hitting X, missing X, missing X, hitting X (1/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 * 1/3)
4. 2/27 chance of missing X, hitting X, hitting X (2/3 * 1/3 * 1/3)
5. 4/81 chance of missing X, hitting X, missing X, hitting X (2/3 * 1/3 * 2/3 * 1/3)

"Sound is vibrating air molecules.  Humans can hear vibrations from (about) as low as 20 times per second to 20,000 times per second (a.k.a. 20Hz to 20kHz).  Long story short, headphones (and all speakers for that matter) sound different because of how well they can produce these frequencies.

Slightly longer story, it's hard to produce a vibration of 20 times per second at the same time as 20,000 times per second, not to mention all the ones in between.  Different drivers (the part of the headphone that makes the sound) have different designs influence their abilities to reproduce these frequencies.

Then there are intentional designs.  For example, professional headphones (such as [Sony MDR-7506](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR7506-Professional-Diaphragm-Headphone/dp/B000AJIF4E)) are made to take your sound and portray it accurately.

"The act of filing bankruptcy serves many purposes, including protection from debtors. The ""default position"" is that the company is going under, but then the argument goes that if you can get it back and running then you can return _something more than zero_ to those who are owed money by said organization.  So...thats better than going under to all parties (employees, lenders, suppliers, etc...).  So...as long as you can demonstrate that you're fucked and that without bankruptcy relief you'd cease to exist then you can get bankruptcy.

The ones that don't continue to operate are the ones where there is no clear path out of bankruptcy.

"I agree with you regarding the possible sequences in which the 2-health minion is killed. However, doesn't your total here include invalid possibilities? You arrived at 81 scenarios based on events that can't occur. That is 3 targets for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th missile. That means you are including XXXO and OXXX and XXXX as possibilities. It seems to me that those can't occur in this scenario, unless the missile is allowed to strike a target that is already dead (I don't know if this is the case, I assume it is not, but I don't play Hearthstone). For the probability to be correct, don't you need to ""remove from play"" any sequence that includes X 3 or more times?

That is because after any sequence in which X has already occurred twice, it can't roll X again because the target must be either the opponent or the 4-health minion.

If you use O as ""Opponent"" and ""4"" as the other minion, then these sequences, to list a couple, can't occur:

X4XX - this would have to become X4XO or X4X4 because the target of X is not valid on the 4th missile, it can't fire at the dead minion, it becomes a 50% on the 4th roll to hit the opponent or 4-health minion, not a 33.3% to hit each of them.

OXXX - this would have to become OXXO or OXX4

4XXX - this would have to become 4XXO or 4XX4

So, the simple story is pretty much this: 

Stumpf, the CEO, mandated a sales strategy of 8 products per customer, which was arbitrary and unrealistic. Stumpf then became aware that fraud was occurring in meeting this sales mandate, but didn't fix it. WF continued to lead the banking industry in cross-sales (roughly 6 accounts per customer to the industry average of 3). Stumpf used this fact to sell stock to investors. When investors purchased more WF stock, the stock price went up. Stumpf owned WF stock. The bump in the stock price increased the value of Stumpf's stock by $200 M dollars.  So, basically, he made $200 M by screwing consumers over and then lying to investors. And politicians, like Warren, are pissed that he thinks he can save face by firing 5,300 employees and returning to business as usual.

"The European Union cannot be considered a country because it is an international *organization*, which has been formed by **independent** states. The European Union can only rule over limited subjects, and a lot of regulations and laws are still within the power of national governments. Through the European Union, individual states have only decided to limit their own powers in order to pursue greater objectives, like free trade, free movement of people, and so on; they have not renounced to their sovereignty.

In fact, what really defines a country is *sovereignty* - i.e. the power that it can exercise over a community in a certain territory. Now, in Europe, the ultimate power over citizens is still competence of individual states. This power sure encounters limits in treaties the state ratifies to become part of international organizations, like the European Union, but it is never superseded by it, unless the treaty itself (like the two founding treaties of the EU) expressly provides it: even then, the treaty prevails only within its bounds, and not also against the core principles of individual states' constitutions.",explainlikeimfive,0

As the romantic era had a focus of emotion in music, vibrato became more popular, and today, vibrato is always used instead of only sometimes.",explainlikeimfive,0

It doesn't necessarily end the company, if that company does what it says it will and if it means that it starts making enough money to pay back those debts.

"You don't *need* to do anything as a business owner except pay the bills.  If you can pay the bills without revenue, you don't need do a damn thing. 

If you can't, you have a few options.  You could take a page out of Elon Musk's book, who took large preorders for a car that was still 2 - 3 years away from production.   Take paid preorders for a small % of the cost, and use those to cover your operating costs until manufacturing day.  Or take preorders for zero dollars, and hope that a large interest in your product will prompt investors to give you seed money for a percent of your company. 

Sillicon Valley does this all the time.  They don't *have* a product yet; they have an idea.  Investors give them ""seed capital"", which is money that lets them start a business, cover costs, hire people, and *build* their product.  The investors (sometimes a ""venture capital"" fund, whose business is doing exactly this) take a piece of your company in return, in the hopes that their stake in your company becomes more valuable than the money they initially gave you.

"Gravity and food are the main limits. Blue whales are large but they live in water where their weight is evenly distributed across their entire body by water pressure. 

Take something like a Giraffe for instance. They are very tall and if you can imagine a heart trying to pump blood with enough force to reach all the way up to their head, that is a LOT of pressure and the heart has to work very hard. Also the neck and blood vessels need to be very strong to contain that pressure without exploding or rupturing. The distance from the brain to the rest of the body also causes problems as nerve impulses travel at a few kilometers a second which seems fast but over 10 meters it adds up to enough of a delay to affect coordination and dexterity. 

So why do Giraffes work then if their height has so many problems? Because it gives them the advantage of eating food that other animals can't reach, it gives them a good view of predators nearby and it puts their necks out of reach of them. 

If gravity were less, then animals could have lighter bodies without the need for thicker bones and muscles, and the blood wouldn't have to fight gravity so hard to pump to all parts of a large body. 


However that being said there is a greater limit than gravity and that's food. If you have a huge body, you need a lot of food and your body size makes you burn a lot of energy getting that food. In the case of humpback and blue whales they are filter feeders that can consume huge quantities of food. 

Dinosaurs were huge but that was because of a high availability of food which allowed larger herbivores, and large herds of large prey allowed  even larger predators to take them down. However this was a huge disadvantage when food became scarce such as plants dying off after volcanic eruptions or meteor strikes and that's one of the reasons tiny little mammals were able to inherit the planet. 

You have to look at the reasons why being large would work in your favor, and balance them against the draw backs of it.  The physical problems of size, the energy collected from eating, vs the energy expended feeding and moving etc.

"ICANN is basically a non-profit organization that helps manage the assignment of IP addresses and domain names on the internet. They also help to run the root DNS servers that basically act like global telephone books telling everyone where a given domain (e.g. `reddit.com`) points to.

So far ICANN has been a US-based organization. However, given that the organization has such a global influence and power / authority over the internet, it is a little strange that it's based out of and under the control of one particular country. So basically Obama wants to make ICANN a fully independent international entity that is not tied to any one particular country / government.

"Video is made up of a bunch of different images that change around 30 times per second. Historically, televisions always ran at the same speed. In North America, it was about 30 frames per second (NTSC), in Europe about 25 frames per second (PAL). This leads to certain problems when you're releasing the same movie between regions (to further complicate things, film projectors have been running at 24 frames per second pretty consistently since sound was added).

On modern (LCD/digital) televisions, there's no problem switching between framerates, so it doesn't really matter anymore if the video you're watching is from Europe or North America, but some videos are still 25 frames per second and some are still 30 frames per second. You have to dig pretty deep to actually find this information (if you have VLC installed, you can find this information in the codec information dialog).

Subtitles, of course, need to be synchronized with the video. Every line in the subtitle has a reference for when it should be displayed, and when it should disappear again.

If you have video and subtitles that are correctly synchronized, and then remove the first second of video, every subtitle will appear one second later than it should. This is consistent though---the synchronization will not get worse throughout, it will always be one second off.

Some subtitle formats use frame numbers as time references rather than minute/second/millisecond. Because this is what the decoder is dealing with internally, there is less processing required to handle the subtitles.

Suppose a subtitle should be displayed after exactly five minutes. If the video is run at 25 frames per second, this means it should be displayed on frame 7500. But, if the video is run at 30 frames per second then this same spot in the video will be frame 9000 (1500 frame difference). At ten minutes, this is frame 15000 @25 or 180000 @30 (3000 frame difference)

This means that the subtitles taken from a European DVD will have different timing references than the same subtitles taken from a North American DVD. If you play a North American video with European subtitles (or vice versa), synchronization will be incorrect. It also means that the further you are into the video, the worse the synchronization will be.

There are tools that will recalculate frame references for subtitles (it's theoretically dead simple to do, but I don't have any experience actually doing it, so no software recommendations).

---

The popular srt format stores timing information in minutes/seconds/milliseconds rather than frame references so it is immune to this problem. If you experience this with an srt subtitle track then most likely you just have poor subtitles.",explainlikeimfive,0

"Employees are not secured creditors. A secured creditor is a party that has a secured interest in the company's assets. This interest is obtained through a security agreement.

For example, if a bank loans a million dollars to a public company, it will require the company to offer some of its assets as security. As a result, if the company defaults on its loan payments the bank can take possession of the secured assets to recover the loaned amount. 

A security agreement uses specific operative clauses that 'grant a security interest' or 'charge' assets. Generally, if the agreement doesn't expressly  state that security is being offered or the assets are being charged, then it is not a security agreement. A lender will not be a secured creditor under such an agreement. Another way to be a secured creditor, however, is to have a registered interest in the company's assets under a legislative scheme (ie torrens title scheme or the personal properties securities register in Australia).

Bankruptcy law, or insolvency law (as it is called in Australia), sets out rules about which classes of creditors are allowed to claim the money they are owed first.

"Women don't generally get paid less than men on a same-job basis.  That is, for a man and a women with the same level of education working the same job, their pay is comparable.  There is a small difference there that is primarily caused by women being less likely to negotiate for a higher salary, though.

But the main difference is caused by the fact that:

1.  Women in general tend to pursue different types of jobs than men.  Women are more likely to be nurses and teachers, and men are more likely to be engineers and corporate executives, for instance.  There's definitely some institutional sexism involved here, but there's also a lot of societal expectation that some jobs are ""for boys"" and some jobs are ""for girls"".

2. Women tend to take time off from their career or schooling when they have children, while men tend to keep working/studying.  This places women at a disadvantage compared to men of the same age, because the men will, in general, have more work experience, and can thus demand a higher salary.
