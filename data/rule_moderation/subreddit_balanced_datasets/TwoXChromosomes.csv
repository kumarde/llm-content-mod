That's horseshit, and I suspect you know it. But you are correct, in the long run the University will probably be fine.

>Like seriously. What's the fucking harm in her blog post?

There isn't really any significant harm in her post, especially since she was considerate enough of public perception to not name any names before an official inquiry. I don't have any issue with her blog sharing her experiences with race, I think it was done in an eloquent manner, respectful of the weight of the issue. As I mentioned in my first post (which I thought was relatively benign, although some of the comments on it have been confusing), based on what she presented in her blog post, I did not see any racial prejudice. I saw what was likely a university professor who was tired of reading plagiarized articles from the rest of their classes egregiously violate rule #1: Don't be an asshole. They did not handle it appropriately. She handled it appropriately with a respectful but expressive blog post and notifying the department head.

My issue is actually more with your comment: ""Its just as important if it was perceived to be about ethnicity as it was if it was intended to be about ethnicity."" That's the language used around trigger warnings, where it's the speaker's responsibility to presciently detect what will and will not be offensive. My issue is with this more broad, more public trend towards trying to create environments where people don't encounter adversity in university classrooms. It's a fool's errand and detrimental to university education. Fortunately, for now, most professors agree with me. https://www.aaup.org/report/trigger-warnings

My issue also revolves around how horseshit clickbait media like HuffPo pick up things like this and give them weight before anybody actually knows whether or not it's warranted. My issue revolves around how people who I normally see as allies, liberals, open minded folks completely losing their rational minds at the whispered mention of bias before they know *anything* about the circumstances.

My issue also revolves around the kind of conspiratorial thinking that gives rise to this interpretation of events. The kind of thinking that assumes people are out to get you, and it's more and more prevalent in *all* corners of society. We're becoming paranoid. People seem so much faster to ascribe malice where there is probably only stupidity, and when accusation carries the weight of national media on other people's lives that's actually an issue.

Interestingly, it's a directly parallel psychology to a whackjob like Trump seeing and claiming conspiracy everywhere he looks. I'm pretty sure he actually believes it. Certainly some of his supporters believe it. In light of your quote, ""its just as important if it was perceived [as conspiracy] as it was if [there was actually a conspiracy],"" is his perception less valid than the author here?

And probably most poignantly, is his publicly expressed perception harmless?",TwoXChromosomes,1

"I'd be interested in your explanation of what feminism is. Because your definition is not the same as other peoples. There are lots of radical feminists who hate men, are completely sexist, peddle lies, and are certainly not for equality. 

However, you might say that feminism is for equality. So is being egalitarian, or humanist. Communism was a political philosophy that was based in equality, but 20 million dead Russians, 100 million dead Chinese, would disagree with that. There hasn't been a single case of Marxist communism that hasn't been corrupt and lead to the death of millions in the name of equality. 

Here's the thing. He's a male growing up in an education system run by women for women. Standardized testing is designed to aid women. It's well established that any form of physical expression by males is frowned upon. So much so that we overly medicate our children instead of finding a new way to teach them. Case in point, look at Finland, the top educated country in the world, and they tailor their education to children individually, they actually let children rough house while playing outside, climb trees, they actually go outside for their break times and only have school for roughly 3 hours per day, and their cases of sexual assault and rape are FAR LOWER than anything we have in the west. 

To the OP, what makes your brother feel this way. There's obviously some experiences he's having at school or in life in general where he feels that he's not being treated fairly. 

In my family, my sister was the only girl with me and my brother being older. She was never punished, never spanked, got whatever she wanted, given money whenever she wanted, got to do whatever she wanted, and there was no repercussions until she had a mental breakdown and was hospitalized, and now she's monitored closely. 

Me on the other hand. I lived under a dictator of a mother who was harsh, emotionless, and almost cruel in her punishments and teaching. It wasn't a man who did bad thing to me, it was women. Women in my family, from my mother, my grandmother, my aunts. Always looking down on me, always doubting me, always second guessing me, always telling me I am wrong. 

Then I come online. And I see these girls, the ones with the male tears mugs, telling me that they are oppressed, how bad their lives are, that they feel marginalized, that I'm oppressive simply for existing. 

You know why I despise feminists, because I hate people that label themselves. People play for a team, they are tribalized in mentality. You are either team penis or vagina. You are feminist or mens rights, you are conservative or liberal. 

There's no inbetween for these people and their ideologies. And that's the problem. People should be treated individually, and with compassion to their background and their paths in life. People come from all walks of life and if you want to talk about gender, or race, or ideology, if you don't try to understand where someone comes from, you will always fail to bring about equality and peace.

Methinks that this suggestion is not unfounded when someone talks like this.  

Women had very, very little impact in history except for several notable exceptions up until more modern times.

OP is basically an abusive person who makes all of the decisions for her household and then pretends there is a semblance of love or affection or mutual respect in what is obviously a one-sided and exploitative relationship. When she discusses having children, she considers it in terms of whether or not she chooses to be on birth control (and reveals the ugly reality, which is, she never has ""conversations"" about children, she just makes the decisions which she makes ""of course not behind his back"" (like anyone believes that).

Her idea of a conversation is getting a quote line from a tired man and then twisting it against him, as if, one tired exasperated statement can be used to close the door on him continuing his lineage or having an actual family of his own (rather than just providing for yours). So now this poor chump is going to spend his life raising another man's child and watching you get continuously impregnated by other men, while you pretend that was his decision rather than your coercion.

"Firstly, you don't know me. I would say that you are part of the problem, as alarmists often detract from the actual issues at hand.

Secondly, victim blaming persists because there is a small portion of validity to the claims. If he hadn't been drunk and engaged in a night of debauchery then this never would have happened. That is not an opinion, it is objective fact. This is not a case of the victim freezing up and not fighting back, OP said that the man was yelling for her to stop. Do men get raped by women, of course they do; but don't act like it's the same scenario as when it happens to a woman. The majority of women are not going to be able to physically overpower a man in the way that a man possibly can to a woman. Also, violence is a much more natural response to a man, probably because it is more effective since an untrained woman probably won't be able to do much damage without a weapon. 

I was responding to that guys comment and forgot that I was on a thread in TwoX, honestly I wouldn't have brought this up in this sub out of respect for it and because I see the shitty things guys say around here.

Victim blaming is a serious issue, but in my comment I wasn't saying that he shouldn't have been drunk and shouldn't have been in a room with a stripper, even though by not doing those things the situation could have been avoided. And I know that sometimes people's reaction in traumatic situations is to freeze, so I am aware that the ""should have fought harder"" excuse is also bullshit. My opinion is that there were either extenuating circumstances that made it impossible for him to physically deter the stripper, or he drunkenly accepted the situation and then tried to cop out the next day. Is he small of stature, does he have some muscular degeneration or disability, was he restrained more than just hands tied?

">If someone says ""I don't want people to starve in Africa"", but does not adopt an African baby, they are not hypocrites. I agree. However, if they say ""I don't want people to starve in Africa"", and then a law is put in front of them to either sign or veto, and it funds food to Africa, and they veto it, **THEN they are a hypocrite. Fair enough.**

No, they aren't, they just have a different view of the role of government than you do. Full stop. 

And what if they personally donate to causes that help disadvantaged children, or volunteer their time for them, or all-around support private solutions to private problems? You're under the assumption that government action has to be taken to not be a hypocrite. I, and many others on the right, will quickly disagree. 

I do not donate to those ""starving African children"" programs, for example. I do, however, donate to Doctors Without Borders regularly because they do good work. I do not believe our government must intervene in every crisis, but I do believe someone who is qualified should help. 

Am I a hypocrite for not wanting government action? No. And I'm going to stop you here before you say ""most pro-life don't do that..."" or anything similar; you do not know what they do, and the political right is arguably much more charitable than the political left when it comes to private organizations. At least when you look at statistics.

>But, if you are FOR legislation that itself CREATES tangential problems (pro-life --> more unwanted babies), but are against laws that take care of those problems (children) (medicare, medicaid, food stamps, section 8 housing, etc), then you are an ASSHOLE at best, and downright evil and completely lacking any empathy, at worst.

The pro-life side's view is that embryos and fetuses are children, and that since it's an independent human being, no other person has the right to take its life. Much like I have no right to take your life or to take the lives of others. You can disagree with this, and I'm sure you do, but this is the fundamental point that needs to be disputed. Not ""conservatives are evil and hate children"" but ""conservatives disagree on what constitutes and human being with natural rights.""

Side note: Before the death penalty is brought up (because it often is) a distinction is made between innocent and guilty for those who are pro-capital punishment (usually the right). Guilty persons have transgressed others and have forefeited their right to life, while innocent persons still should not have their lives taken. This is an oversimplification, but it's to prevent goalpost-shifting. I trust you won't try to do that. 

Back to the point:

>But, if you are FOR legislation that itself CREATES tangential problems (pro-life --> more unwanted babies), but are against laws that take care of those problems (children) (medicare, medicaid, food stamps, section 8 housing, etc), then you are an ASSHOLE at best, and downright evil and completely lacking any empathy, at worst.

If the legislation is viewed as reinforcing the natural right to life, then it's difficult to say it's creating tangential problems. Government aid would certainly help, but it doesn't make politicians or their supporters ""Assholes"" if they don't support all of the programs you've listed. And if it did, you must realize that not all on the right are against safety nets. There are very few prominent Republicans calling for the complete abolition of welfare programs, especially those that help children in need.

I was installing a dishwasher a couple years ago (for reference I am a dude, and also basically an idiot.)  So I had pretty much no idea what I was doing... had to step down the water lines to fit various fixtures, replumb the sink, all that jazz.  So I drew a little diagram with measurements and headed off to my local Menards.  I wandered the plumbing aisle for a bit, but couldn't find anything that seemed to meet my super confusing and very specific set of needs.

Long story short I met the *most awesome woman in the world*.  

She was probably 60, and was well up on the spectrum in terms of some kind of autism... she talked to herself and had a super weird facial tick... she kept incessantly shaking her head involuntarily.  But goddamn that woman *knew plumbing.*  She quite literally snatched the diagram outta my hands, and started running around the plumbing aisles like Rain Man.  

*""You're gonna need one of these, this thing... I know this doesn't look right, but if you cut it here and twist it like this... plus with some of this plumber's tape, it'll work fine.  Oh, and here's a fitting you for this part...""*  And then she went over my diagram in great detail, explaining exactly how I was to hook all this gadgetry up.

$22 and 2 hours later, we had our first load of sparkling clean dishes and *no leaks!*

It was like meeting one of the witches from a Terry Pratchett book.  Not magic or sorcery... just a crazy old lady who *makes everything right.*  As you may not know, in Pratchett's stories, witching has less to do with magic and more to do with birthing sheep, making cheese and helping old people get their socks on straight.  This lady was *a witch*... in the best sense of the term.  I will never forget her.

"Males, regardless of what you think ""she's asking for it"" may imply... As females, we are taught (yes, taught) that certain phrases like this are red flags for men who may have the intentions of assaulting us.

Women, seeing as a lot of men don't get this same education- at least not up until recently- on how specific phrasing could indicate a red flag for a predator... The outrage we're seeing here is their lack of understanding from our end.

So, before demonizing *all men* for literally having no idea what it's like to have to live a life where you need to understand the red flags of somebody who is a predator or if a person is being flirtatious/ignorant/etc... We need to be able to set aside personal outrage and explain things from a neutral standpoint.

All men are no rapists. Many men say really dumb shit when they are with friends and drinking... Does it make it acceptable? Not at all. But nor does degrading and demonizing men in return.

Men, regardless of how YOUR personal thought process works regarding the outfit a woman wears- nothing says she wants to be raped; in fact, it doesn't say she wants to have sex either. Women, unlike men, don't always got out with the sole purpose of sex. Sometimes is simply us playing ""dress up"" but as adults. We can leave our house and enjoy being pretty and dancing and having fun with friends. So while some women intend to have sex, some only desire flirtatious attention, and some literally just want to play dress-up with their friends  (but with alcohol and dance music).

I'm sure there are many holes in my statement and you can nitpick the fuck out of it BUT being a female who spends most of her time hanging around males... I can say that, regardless of whatever sexual thoughts they have (and, seriously  ladies, I hear and know the shit we say too), the vast majority do not lack self control or dignity. Even those who say some really dumb, ignorant shit. 

So educate with neutrality and understanding rather than only taking one side and throwing stones. I promise you'll get a lot more results.

"Perpetrators have a vested interest in avoiding prosecution. Victims (of any crime) are often asked about areas that may imply they carry some blame. In my experience this is more about anticipating a defence solicitor's attempts to discredit a victim and giving the prosecutor a solid base to counter these attempts.
For example, victim is not asked about alcohol consumption. Perpetrator arrives for trial months or even years later and the issue of alcohol consumption is disputed (""she wasn't that drunk"", ""she knew exactly what she was doing""). This potentially weakens the prosecution. Having the information recorded as evidence at the time can help here. E.g. ""I had been drinking for three hours and had 6 doubles of vodka. That's a lot for me and I was really drunk"". This, especially if corroborated by witnesses, puts the victims capacity to consent in far clearer terms. 
Being a victim of crime is crappy. Knowing you've been a victim of a crime and that the person responsible managed to publicly discredit you and avoid prosecution is even crappier.

On the other hand, it actually costs a company a lot to hire an intern!  Sure, your work isn't top priority, but chances are if the company has interns they also have some pressing reason for doing so, like wanting to make a good impression on your graduating class, or help out new employees.

I'm not going to lie, some companies are going to have a shit attitude and go after the complainer - those probably aren't places that you want to work in the long term.  But, on the plus side, there are a lot of people who really like helping out students and new grads, and really enjoy helping people get their career started.  And there are companies that place a big priority on a positive, supportive workplace culture.  

I know I'm totally butting in here, but I think it would be a good idea for you to figure out what you can do to figure out the difference between the two environments/situations, and how you can give your boss/employer a chance to step up and be great in this situation, instead of expecting the worst.  I know it's super scary too when your finances and reputation depend on it, and there is a chance that things will end poorly.   But, I also doubt that they'll fire you just because you lightly brought up that another employee was causing you problems - and part of that assumption comes from bringing up the same shit when I was an intern (and having it go poorly :/).  Through trial and error I've kind of come up with my own ways to gauge how supportive coworkers and employers will be and I've found that to be incredibly helpful when interviewing and job searching after college.

"Let's split this up.

First, let's address the idea that 'baby powder' causes cancer. That is highly inaccurate. Talcum powder which contains talc is connected to cancer. ""Baby powder"" is made with corn starch which contains no talc of any kind. ""Baby powder"" is safe while talcum powder, even the modern variant, may **not** be safe.

If you take a look [here](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/athome/talcum-powder-and-cancer), you will see they divide talc into two types. The type you mentioned which contains asbestos and the later type used which is asbestos free. **BOTH** have been connected to increases in risk for ovarian cancer. The science is still out on the actual risk, but there is no reason to take a chance.

Second, you have to look at what tampons are made out of. A quick look [here](http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2010/10/whats-really-tampon-and-pad) shows you get what you pay for. Beyond the obvious ""Have you tried not being poor yet?"", tampons might not be a great option for women who can't afford better brands that use organic cotton. Diva/Moon cups, lunapads, Thinx panties, and many other options might be better.

The legal liability will be limited to certain manufacturers. As the link above shows, they are buying the cheapest brand from the cheapest shelf in the cheapest store. If those aren't imported from China/Mexico/etc, they are made by a company that will vanish into thin air at the first hint of major legal action. There won't be any money to collect. The better brands will defend themselves saying the cancer risk is from other tampons the user used instead of theirs. It would be virtually impossible to prove otherwise.

tl;dr As usual, the burden will fall solely on the shoulders of women. No one will be held accountable. Buyer beware.

"You question is how to determine if a person is just making casual conversation or trying to find out if you are dateable. If you don't want to talk long enough to figure that out, then end the conversation. How you do it up to you. Usually though, the eyes will tell you what the motive is - a guy looking for a hookup will look at your body more than you face.. And they will get blatant about pushing their hook up game, especially if you ask them intellectual questions back. Few things will turn off a guy looking for a hook up more than a girl who wants to talk about intellectual things. Mostly because hook up artists are usually pretty dumb and they don't want to put the effort into it...

It might be hard for her to do, but she needs to tell him that despite the fact he acts like he doesn't know any better, that he should be able to control his behavior.  She can tell him she has reported it.  She can tell him that she is upset with him and angry with him for jeopardizing their business relationship.  She should tell him that from hereon out their interactions can only be business related with no social interaction and that he cannot be around her family at all.  And then she has to stick with it.  If he pulls her funding, that's what he does and she'll find a way to work through it.  She really needs to keep an eye on the girl.  She may be unaffected by it, or perhaps not.  She certainly needs to learn proper responses to unwanted attention.  (Yell or scream if touched, Get clear away, tell an adult, grab her phone and take a picture of him or what ever.)  Something similar happened to a 12 year old relative on a city bus.

Which meant she was a trainwreck waiting to happen, and I don't know of anyone in high school who dated her. She might have had a much older boyfriend. 

I think she ended up as some sort of secretary or executive assistant, something forgettable, ex husband, 2 kids.  

So, people are judgmental in a lot of different ways, like it or not. If it's not your looks, its who you hang out with, if you drink/party too much, if you've got a good college lined up, or if you're gonna be career military, go into the trades, etc. , how messed up is your family, plus whatever gossip goes around.

The life of the unborn is not worth more, but a pro lifer sees it as being worth the same. And the most basic right is indeed the right to life. No other rights can be exercised if one does not exist.

So when confronted with any dilemma which has at one side the well being, the comfort, the economic position or the health of the mother and at the other side the life of the foetus, they will always choose the latter.

Only when the life of the mother is in grave danger there is a problem. Then and only then it seems reasonable to choose for the mother since she is a conscious person.

It's also hard to say where to put the line. You assume that babies have the right to live, but even toddlers do not display the ability to respect another agent's rights or display moral reciprocity within a community of equal agents. So the point where one says, this is a human with rights, is pretty arbitrary. And even after birth a baby will die when neglected and is therefore still dependent upon the mother, or at least other people.",TwoXChromosomes,0

Sure.  

Slapping a 12 year old on the ass is sexual assault.

Giving a 12 year old a wedgie is not sexual assault because it does not involve touching intimate body parts, however it can absolutely be constituted as battery if it was unwanted.

If your (new) figure is very curvy and fit, like Amber Rose for example, then you will probably get more attention than other ladies. That being said if you dress like her - tight, short dresses with dramatic makeup and hair color- then yes, more attention. Dress in floppy tops and long pants like, I dunno, Kristen Stewart, and there will probably be fewer comments.

As to what to wear, it depends on your lifestyle. Easiest would be things that are versatile (for different occasions), like black jeans and some plain t shirts. Easiest thing to fit are knit dresses (that's why pregnant ladies love dresses), good place for those is places like target.

"Preface: This got longer than I intended. It's not really aimed at you, please don't take it as an attack of any kind, but rather as an elaboration and extension of the ideas under discussion. I blame painkillers and muscle relaxants. Sorry.

I think this is all a strange misunderstanding. People dress in all kinds of ways, and make all kinds of unreasonable assumptions about the intent of others.

I dress the way I do primarily to have pleasant interactions with others in my daily life (while being comfortable). This means I have to come off as reasonably wealthy, educated, and cosmopolitan. I'm a whole lot more interested in appearing intimidating than in appearing traditionally attractive, and I consider dissuading muggers to be a sensible primary goal when choosing a wardrobe. And this is still massively simplified.

Everybody has a huge array of different reasons for choosing what they wear. The problem under discussion is when an individual man assumes that an individual woman (or all women) is dressing specifically to get attention/sex from him, and the manner in which he expresses this/responds to conversation and body language/carries on the interaction. Actually, come to think of it, it's perfectly possible to assume that all women are dressing the way they are purely to get attention from you and still not make an ass of yourself - I know a guy like this, and he's just one of the most pleasant people I've ever been around.

I suspect that ""dress nice for themselves"" is something that is arguable, similar to arguments centering around the existence of altruism. Is anything we do ever for anybody other than ourselves, etc.

Even when somebody is dressing specifically for attention, they generally want certain kinds of attention from certain people (or kinds of people). The lesbians at the dive bar I frequently were split pretty evenly femme/butch, but I'm pretty damn confident that the overdressed femmes weren't looking to get hit on by the likes of me. I've got a friend with, ah, less-than-chaste proclivities, but when she wears too little in public she's not looking to meet anyone at this point - she just wants to be looked at, and to make people jealous. She's a tease. It's absolutely an invitation to look but not to touch, so far as strangers are concerned.

"No. This usually doesn't happen anymore, unless there's a severe complication. That idea got popular in the 40s-60s when women would have ""twilight births."" They would be put under general anesthesia with heavy drugs during labor because nobody seemed to realize that non-epidural narcotics do cross the placental barrier and will knock the baby out as well as the mother. So for many years doctors had to smack babies to wake them up so they would breathe. Nowadays, with epidurals (where the medicine stays along the mothers spinal cord and not in her blood stream) babies are usually quite alert after a birth. ",TwoXChromosomes,0

Speaking as someone who had a tubal (and appendicitis), abdominal surgery is no joke. And you'd have to have it a second time if you ever changed your mind (*and* the reversal might not even work).

It's hard to prove something like this unless done in front of many witnesses. From what it sounds like, the mother of the victim was the only witness. In court, two people testifying against a wealthy man like him won't go anywhere. Also, if he hasn't provided any money or signed anything saying he will, his lawyers could claim that he denied her funding and this must be her way of retaliating against him.

"The softball field being a half a mile away could simply be a courtesy to those who were visiting the area.  People will come watch High School Football, and are much less likely to come watch Softball.  Also its closer to the lockers themselves, and the teams may actually utilize them more than the softball teams.  (I'm not sure.)  It could simply be because of the timing that things came about.  Football field created first, so it gets to be closer to the school, and later softball field was added because there was a demand for it, so they weren't going to destroy the football field, and put it further away.
