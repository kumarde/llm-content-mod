If you look through my post history you can see i just a couple hours ago posted a pretty simple step by step guide to MS at a .86% cost. So even with the CSP you will come out .14% ahead and meet the min spend.  

Also, please if you do apply for the CSP use a referral link form the referral link thread from someone who has helped you or deserves it, or just ask me and i would be more than happy to provide my own. Any questions at all feel free to PM me anytime. I am also happy to help you figure out MS, its really a lot easier than you think. ",churning,1

"Quick question: I'm about to spend $1300 on a computer, and I'm wondering if I should apply for a card first to put it on that. I have the money to pay it back right away, I'm just looking for some type of benefit.

I heard a radio ad the other day saying something about Chase offering double cash back for the first year for new members. I've never had a credit card so it seems like a decent idea.

I know very little about this so I really appreciate you putting up with me. If my income and student loan balance are things you'd need to know to help me with this I can pm you.

Just looking to see what you would do in my situation. From what I've read here the most lucrative reward for me would likely be points on some card that I can spend on plane tickets for domestic (US) flights.",churning,1

I'm 13K miles behind for my trip and I was wondering if there is other way to buy mile other that in the United website bc is very expensive. I tried family transferring the miles but many of them don't want to bc they are saving their miles for a future trip. Mine is within 3 weeks. Any suggestions? Thank you,churning,1

"4/24 +1 loan. Opened 1 chase 1 Amex, and one citi card in last 24 months chase was 12 months ago. Also, opened one store card. I did recently open a new student loan account but o don't think they consider those with the 5/24 rule only CCs. Although that Would only put me at 5/24 exactly. $160k income Credit score Low 700s due to multiple recent apps and HP cli. Initially got 7-10 day language.  Called to check app status got the 2 week language that I have read on here was favorable. Called recon line and gave up after 20 minute wait. Got called by chase about 20 minutes later to verify some information and was approved while on the phone. 29k limit. whole process took about 2.5 hours from when I applied to when I got off the phone with the approval.",churning,1

"1/24, 96k, 755 TU, 747 EQ

Chase:
CSP - 7.5k limit

Other:
BofA Travel Rewards Platinum - 10k limit

I went into the branch and got a pending but was told it would be expedited it as soon as it was approved. I was suspect of the pending so I wanted to call to verify but by the time I got home and logged into my account the CSR was there with a number and a 28.8k limit. I'm assuming this means it was approved? I never received a call or email or anything since leaving the branch and was not pre approved as far as I know.

My wife is an authorized user on the CSP. If I get the CSR, it would probably make sense to downgrade the CSP so we are not paying a double fee, right? (Especially since our 2 year CSP card anniversary is approaching...) The drawback in this case is that I'd want her to be an authorized user on the new CSR, but I think it costs $75/year?

Is there any reason I shouldn't move forward with this plan? Any idea if the Chase Sapphire Reserve can eventually be downgraded to a Chase Sapphire Preferred (or another free Chase card) if necessary?

Edit: So far it's worked fine in Cape Town for buying a bus pass and the deposit at my hotel. In case it matters my foreign DPs are with the plastic card (some chip readers may have trouble with the thicker metal one). 

Edit 2: CSR also worked fine for the deposit for a car rental.

Another thing you all may know but I certainly didn't, is that you can redeem UR points for excursions through the chase portal (far right tab, next to 'rental cars'), which (in my limited experience) are 'valued' at almost the same as you'd pay IRL, effectively making THAT MUCH MORE of your vacation completely free. Ex: snorkeling with seals, whale watching, and great white shark cage diving here in Cape Town.

"Thanks a ton all. Few comments:

1. Why the negative vote? If the question is stupid or there is a better method, please let me know. It's personal preference after all, but even if your comment doesn't apply, it could help others 

2. I missed the 75k spend part. I average ~$8k/month in spending (never done MS, don't plan to unless needed) so could meet it as I approach end of next year assuming I don't spread my spending across other cards. Will look into that. Thanks

3. UA silver isn't all too important. Maybe it is just me, but I fly cross-country every 4 weeks. Always nice to have a little extra perk and the possibility (though low) of an upgrade. I should mention that baggage doesn't matter as my flights aren't paid by me, they are paid for by my company and I believe you cannot get free baggage unless you pay using the UA CC. 

4. Someone mentioned above that I am in this for Marriott points. That is true (unless you're saying that UR points are more valuable. I just joined Chase so still learning which is better and the way to go). We travel a lot in a year and always stay in Marriotts (personal and business reasons) so the free nights (when not on business) are always nice and the little perks are always valuable

5. I have the CS(R). Why would one recommend the CS(P)? Aren't they essentially the same thing with CS(R) being better?

Overall, I am just looking for recommendation as I am new to this entire game. I started using credit cards just last Fall and applied for the CS(R) beginning of September. I've already spent way more than 4k on it and now realize I could have just applied for something else and spent the balance there and received more benefits. I guess we all learn as we make mistakes. 

This has become a long post, but finally, here is what I gather:
Marriott rewards makes the most sense. Ritz offers perks like GE (for my wife as I used the CS(R) one for myself) and PP for free, but costs 450. I could use CS(R), but would need to pay 75 for my wife's PP. UA is useless for me so that's out. ",churning,0

You get $150 back after spending $500 in the first 3 months, and you'll get 5% back at Costco through the end of the year.  After that, it's a 1% general use card with 5% categories that change each quarter.

"I've opened up 11 cards in the last five months. 4 are Chase cards, including an Ink+. (I also have a fifth Chase card I opened three years ago.)

And, like a bartender telling the person about to pass out that they've had enough, Chase finally turned me down, for a Marriott Biz card. The reasons are:

Too many requests for credit or opened accounts with us

The outstanding debt on your credit accounts is too high

Too many recent requests for credit or reviews of your credit

I know from having called recon that they can see 8 hard pulls; if they were to look again, they'd see 10.

Is this even worth trying to call recon again about? If so, what kind of strategy should I use? The outstanding debt issue is simply wrong, so I could push back on that. But the other issues...what do I tell them? That I really *need* this one too?

Or should I just hang out for a while, since that card's not going anywhere, and try again in a few months, maybe when they're running a promo on it?

I was kinda hoping to get this one in so I could have enough Starpoints to do something good with before I started the 5/24 clock again.",churning,0

"**Negative:** I cannot seem to figure out why my friend has no pre-approvals with Chase and neither can their branch banker. They opened an account earlier in the year as well as a Freedom to establish a relationship. Things have been good on that front. A few months ago they applied for an Ink+ and were denied for a number of reasons (biz too new, rev too low, etc) and the recon rep also mentioned a Chase charge-off from nearly 7 years ago for a *very* low amount. They've worked hard to repair their credit and that's the last negative listed on their report. Their banker has even said that others with more recent charge offs for higher amounts have been pre-approved so he's not sure what's going on either. I've added them as an AU on my oldest account, and we've tried a few other things, all with no success. It's been a pretty frustrating experience, especially in comparison to the success I've been having.

**Positive:** After seeing so many people report in-branch pre-approval for the CSR in September after none in August I decided to stop by again. Once there my banker looked and I was pre-approved! Exciting! But I had let my reported balances creep up on a number of cards I've been using as I wasn't anticipating any apps for at least a month or two. This generated some anxiety since I wasn't sure where my CS was at the moment. I decided to **not** apply and perhaps come back in a week once balances were updated.

Well, I got almost home and realized that was stupid and I was tired of missing out on good offers because I waited too long (I didn't apply when the leaked link was posted because I was too chicken about the bonus language not explicitly listed). So I have ***just*** enough time to turn around and get back to the branch before it closes. I walk in about 30 seconds before their security guard locks the doors and my banker goes through the app process and submits. Fingers crossed. He gets a message that he needs to call in. :( He just needs to confirm my identity. :) and then high fives me as the rep on the phone talks to him. After handing me the phone I'm informed of my CL. It's the highest I've gotten from any app and I was utterly stunned (it's not close to the highs I've seen mentioned here, but personally my highest). THAT was a great feeling walking out of the door.

Oh, and when asking about expedited shipping, the phone rep said not possible. Then the next day I got a notification about an overnighted package from Chase arriving. And it was a metal card. Great day for me!",churning,0

Thanks for the feedback. So therefore you value SPG higher than MR or UR 1:1. I am leaning toward the SPG business card (to replace my current AMEX open card). Seems like the 25k offer is good (not best) and I feel like I should jump on this card before it is combined with Marriott.

"Me and GF did MSP-SFO in August in Delta using Korean miles (UR points) for 25K roundtrip (last minute trip). Stayed at Holiday Inn from the points we got from sending those letters earlier in the year. The bonus was that we each got $200 Delta travel credit because it was during the whole Delta system outage.

For November, we’re going to Nepal. We booked Business class on MSP-BOS-DOH-KTM on Qatar Airways using American miles. Return is KTM-DOH-PHI-MSP. Total miles 140,000 each. Choose these routes specifically to check out the A350. We each got the AA platinum card twice (60,000 *2) &amp; the Citi Gold 50,000 miles. Staying with the parents in Nepal.

For March 2017, we’ve booked MSP-SEA-KOA and return is HNL-MSP on Delta again using Korean miles (US points) for 25K roundtrip.
Haven’t booked any places to stay in either Kona or Kauai. Open to suggestions. For Kona, we are planning on using my SPG points (have 40K) and stay at the Marriott Kea Bach, 5 nights. For Kauai, thinking about using our 2 free nights each at the Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort for 4 nights &amp; 2 anniversary free nights each.

Plan on using our Delta $200 credits for flight to Iceland next summer(Delta flies there direct from MSP in the summer &amp; sometimes tickets are around $450 round trip)

2. So knowing that the DPs have been contradictory, I went and searched some blogs and found [this](http://frequentmiler.boardingarea.com/2016/08/25/how-to-count-your-524-status/). He updated last week that biz counts probably don't count... so yeah, forgive me if I don't always have knowledge of the absolute most recent consensus from blog articles (ones that were published a long time ago and only edited with new info, at that).  

So yeah, if you think you know more than me, go for it. Be the DP you want to see. But next time you come looking for advice, say ""thank you, but I've seen some DPs..."" if you've got something contradictory.",churning,0

Side point, I downgraded from Exec to gold star, because the 2% wasn't worth my spending. Chase 5% makes up the difference easily",churning,0

Hope that helps. ",churning,0

"I don't mean to overstate our shopping at Costco.  We just buy our gas there and try to buy in bulk where it makes sense.  The Freedom has the pain-in-the-ass categories to deal with, plus the 5% maxes out after $1500 spent in each category.  Looks like the CS(R) is our best bet at least for the first year, and then we'll probably drop off to a CSP or regular Sapphire card.  Thanks for the advice!",churning,0

"I know a lot of people have been grumbling about the new bonus category for the Platinum not living up to the hype. It actually sort of worked out well for me, because I needed a flight to San Francisco next weekend for a conference. The best part is that I get reimbursed, so can't go wrong, right?

Well, I had to purchase my ticket on October 4th to confirm my attendance, but when I called the Concierge the next day to ask about retroactive credit (because the category doesn't start until today), they said that they could not extended. I even explained that I also have the PRG, and having heard about the announcement on Tuesday and thinking it couldn't have worked out any better, would otherwise have put it on my PRG. 

I ended up cancelling the ticket thanks to United's 24-hour cancellation policy, but the price has since jumped in the past 24 hours to about $200 more for the transcon. However, the other reason I was pushed to cancel was because some of the logistics around the conference seem a bit sketchy.

* They were supposed to contact me 3 weeks out (about 2 weeks ago) confirming my attendance. They did it only two days ago. 
* They needed a confirmed ticket to SFO as a way to confirm attendance, which I sent them two days ago almost as soon as I received their email.
* I haven't received any more email since then.

My plan was to book a hotel for the weekend as soon as they got back to me, but since they haven't... Anyhow, I think it'll work out in the end. If I have to pay the higher price for a ticket, it just means more points to look forward to in the future.",churning,0

"I live near an airport that has a lot of Southwest flights, so naturally I'd like to go for the CP for 2017/2018 as I think I can get a lot of value out of that.

The recent reductions in point bonuses for the Premier/Plus have me a bit spooked, though, since I was aiming to apply near the end of the month in order to hit the bonuses in January.

It seems like 50k is still available through certain routes (chase.com), however. Should I just bite the bullet and apply right now, even though it would be riskier since I'd have to time the min spend for Jan 5th? Or should I just wait and try to be opportunistic if/when good offers come up again towards the end of the year?

Another alternative would be to go the Marriott Nights+Flights route for CP. I'm sitting on around 35k SPG points right now, and could possibly hit the threshold with an SPG card and a Marriott card. Seems like that's the more difficult route to go for CP, though.",churning,0
"Oh and @OP, if you do go for these two, don't forget to apply for the Marriott first as you're at 4/24 and it is under the 5/24 rule, whereas the IHG is not. ",churning,0

It's pre-qualified.

It just means they think you have a good chance at getting the card and want you to get that card.

Pre-approval is only in branch and actually means you WILL be approved provided nothing crazy has changed since they gathered the info.",churning,0
