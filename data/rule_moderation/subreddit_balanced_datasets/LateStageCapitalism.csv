There is a revolution going on right now digitally. We can control the outcome!

Twitter is being used more and more like a petition, and Facebook is being forced to rate articles, in addition to considerable pressure to add a dislike button. These are big reluctant players in the new political landscape.

At the same time there are hundreds of new initiatives trying to push their way into the market, here is a list of some of them,
http://democracy.foundation/similar-projects/

I know you are aware of this but consider this, If you ruled the world and decided one day, because you are a nice guy, that you wish to know the desires of your people, and you really meant it, would you?

A). Have people design all different kinds of Organizations that work in different ways, with different questions to answer, and then take all that and try to figure out what the people want.

                   OR

B). Get the best people together you can to build one system using the best agreed-upon technology,(Google search engines).

The founding fathers of the United States did not decide to ""farm out"" the voting process to a variety different organizations for this obvious reason.

All those other direct democracy initiatives require you to traverse menus, and answer questions. The limited amount of data they are working with and their use of questions, makes it unfeasible for them to use search engines.

Removing questions enables google style search engines, which then enables unlimited data, which then allows for a monopoly on the opinion market, owned by the ""people"".

The ease of expressing your opinions on anything, all in one location, with no menus, will have a compounding effect on participation.

But there is something even more important we would like to show you, in the natural process, when a small group of people are trying to find consensus, suggestions and ideas are put forward by any one or more individuals in the group. 

Informal voting takes place. 

Based on that information, more suggestions may emerge.

This process is repeated until the highest level of satisfaction is achieved.

Only then is the vote official. The free flow of unofficial voting is essential.

We would like to add that various voting reforms are attempts to supplement for our inability to provide, the free flow of unofficial voting. we are recreating this on a worldwide scale.

The ""Your Upinion"" App, all opinions, on all subjects, no questions.
 Here is our plan, http://www.yourupinion.com/

No i'm not saying ""greed is good"", I'm saying that a system whereby an agreed upon central form of currency can be exchanged for goods and services is a VERY effective thing. Barter fails at scale. Wealth doesn't transport very effectively over long distances with barter. Farmers made whiskey because wheat didn't transport well. Dairy farmers made butter because milk spoiled, and concentrated ""milk"" was more valuable and easier to transport than 10,000 gallons of cow juice. The system works when people (like me) have a moral compass and pay fairly, the system CAN be fair. I'm not a republican, I'm not an oppressor, I'm not a rich man, I'm not cruel. I came from nothing. as a kid I ate ritz crackers for dinner because my dad bailed and mom had no skills, so jobs were scarce for single mom unskilled women. that shit is still true. My cleaning lady for our office is treated REALLY well, since my mom wielded a mop for years. So. Fuck me? No. Thanks very much for the offer, but I'm taken, and I'd rather fuck someone that knows what hard work actually feels like. What having ""sleep for dinner"" feels like. What the crippling fear of not being able to feed your kids feels like. Go back to school next semester, and continue to live the fantasy for now.

Race isn't necessarily going to be the focus of the powerful. A capitalist isn't required to be racist. An antiracist capitalist is not a contradiction in terms.

There is a leap illogically made from racism to capitalism.

However, it is often the case that maintenance of power exploits any division in the underclass to focus them against one another instead of against the ruling class. This is not confined to capitalism.

""It is not possible for any thinking person to live in such a society as our own without wanting to change it. For perhaps ten years past I have had some grasp of the real nature of capitalist society. I have seen British imperialism at work in Burma, and I have seen something of the effects of poverty and unemployment in Britain. In so far as I have struggle against the system, it has been mainly by writing books which I hoped would influence the reading public. I shall continue to do that, of course, but at a moment like the present writing books is not enough. The tempo of events is quickening; the dangers which once seemed a generation distant are staring us in the face. One has got to be actively a Socialist, not merely sympathetic to Socialism, or one plays into the hands of our always-active enemies."" - George Orwell  

""The only thing for which we can combine is the underlying ideal of Socialism; justice and liberty. But it is hardly strong enough to call this ideal underlying. It is almost completely forgotten. It has been buried beneath layer after layer of doctnaire priggishness, party squabbles and half-backed progressivism until it is like a diamond hidden under a monition of dung. The job of the Socialist is to get it out again. Justice and liberty! Those are the words that have got to ring like a bugle across the world."" - George Orwell

During allied occupation of Germany, the Soviet Union consolidated two political parties together, the Democratic Socialist Party of Germany and The Communist Party of Germany.

I'd also like to point out that during the Bolshevik rise to power, it was almost determined that the new Union would be a democratic Socialist government instead of a communist Socialist government. Which would've caused huge changes in the development of the post war world. America was anti-dictatorship, which is what led them to vilify the Soviet Union. Over time dictatorship got associated with Communism due to Stalin's political beliefs that capitalism was inherently unequal and that it would impede progressive ideology.

First we start with the premise that all money is tied to GDP and that fiat currency will inflate or deflate to find equilibrium with the GDP of the country. (This is why we have monetary policy)

So what this graph should be depicting is deflation. The value of a (dollar) rising as productivity rises but wages stagnate. 

So luxury goods should be skyrocketing in price and economic engines should be made to manufacture more luxury goods, while practical goods should be getting cheaper. A kind of stagflation.

Or we are lifting massive amounts of people out of poverty so even though our productivity is massively rising those goods and services are going to more and more people.

>""But most often, we're able to turn that around and not in the end have somebody lose their housing,"" McLennan said.

With two people to witness the eviction and act on her behalf, records say, Batts collected some clothes and personal items. **She told the officers she had somewhere to stay, McLennan said.**

She didn't show up to the court case, so they couldn't work with her in anyway to keep her in. Also, she told the officers who evicted her that she had somewhere to stay. 

We have warming centers open here they could have taken her to instead. 

The real enemy here is mental health care, not the apartment company. She obviously had something going on that she was unable to get help for, whether taking the steps herself or being assisted into it. 

There isn't much the apartment can do when she doesn't show up to the court. Most of the time the courts can work something out to prevent them being removed, and the officers here in Portland would definitely transport her to a shelter of some kind if she just mentioned she needed it.

It is horrible this is the second person to die here this winter, but this is much more a failing of our mental health care system. We can't force assistance on someone, as that would be fascist... but there needs to be a better path to care.

From the start, he planned Tesla as a 3-phase endeavor. Phase 1 was a small-quantity luxury car. Profits from that would help to finance more efficient, larger-scale construction facilities for larger quantities of less expensive vehicles. With tax breaks taken into account, the Model 3 isn't much more expensive than an average car on the market - and of course, profits from Model 3 could be used to finance expansion of the megafactories, as well as models that are cheaper still.

When Wikileaks showed that the DNC didn't like him in private emails a lot of salty far left and far right took it as ""proof"" that Hillary and the DNC had rigged everything.  Even though the ideas they threw around, like bringing up his atheism never actually happened.

Just some choice examples from ""thisismytrollacct99"";

The southern primaries weren't rigged, bernie literally didn't campaign there and said those states didn't matter because of the voters that lived there (many people took that to be minorities) so obviously he was destroyed there.  

The majority of super delegates weren't pledged until months *after* the primary started, not months *before* like people keep saying for whatever reason.  And then Bernies supers started to abandon him anyways because he kept going after being mathematically eliminated while lying to his fans and saying he could win (and still asking for donations).

Brazile leaked a that there would be a question about Flint MI, right before the debate IN Flint MI, etc.  

Wikileaks showed everybody more or less that the DNC wasn't perfectly neutral, which isn't inherently bad because they never acted on it and of course humans are going to have an opinion of people. Sanders lost so badly after whipping his supporters into a frenzy, they see conspiracy everywhere because otherwise they'd have to admit there was something wrong with bernie which many of them can't seem to do.

You know, it was the other way 'round. Things are so far away because people have cars, and now a lot of cities are based upon that and people end up *needing* a car.

But seriously, cars enabled suburbs which takes a toll on city infrastructure, then poor people also end up having to buy cars and etc. It's also partly what causes us to have huge shopping malls and supermarkets: Getting in and out of your car, parking, etc to go to 5-6 stores is impractical (while we could do that by *walking* before, as things were walking distance of each other), so they build a huge store that encompasses absolutely everything you need and you only need to park 1 time.

"&gt;  if there is such data exists that corresponds with the claim that countries that redistribute wealth are economically better off, 

Economically not necessarily (and I never claimed that), socially most definitely: Crass enough economical inequality invariably leads to social inequality, whether it's about political influence or stratifying of class systems which lead to all kinds of internal conflict and trouble. All this is old news! There's a reason the Romans were big on bread and games, without the stabilising factor of social programmes the empire would've fallen into chaos much sooner.

One way in which it definitely impacts is that to maximise economic productivity you need social mobility to get smart/talented kids to where they can do their best, social inequality is doing the exact opposite. Of course you can alleviate that with stipends etc but that's not the same as optimising it.

Last, but not least: The US has a diverse and robust economy just by sheer size alone, the only other economy you can compare it against without risking doing apples vs. oranges is the EU single market.

"You know a side effect of having barely any industry in your country is that almost no one has to endure low-skill production labour. Be glad, because that's not something anyone wants to do.

You are not COMPETING with people in those countries for work. Rather, the manufacturing jobs have been replaced with service jobs where you sell their products rather than produce them for 12 hours a day while destroying your body. That is where the working class in Britain has moved, which can be demonstrated by labour force statistics. 

The Office for National Statistics of the United Kingdom found that between 1978 and 2016, the percentage of the British workforce employed in manufacturing (including mining) has fallen from 26.3% to 8.0%, while the percentage employed in the service sector has increased from 63.2% to 83.1%. Unemployment levels haven't changed much since the global production shift which began in the late 70's and 80's, either. From a low of 2.6% during the 70's oil bubble to as high as 10% in the mid 80's and 90's, to 5.4% today.

You live in a consumer society, they live in a producer society. If you had a choice, you certainly wouldn't fucking choose the latter. So have empathy for the foreign worker, rather than othering them as your ""competitor."" It is ridiculous that your take away from this is not that millions of people are being exploited to a degree that you could not possibly fathom, but that the ""British working class"" is being screwed. Really, that's it? You want conditions for them to get better... So that you you can get wealthier??? How about because they live in horrible fucking conditions that no one should endure and that you care about them?

All labour is exploitation, but I'm pretty sure if you're going to have to sell your labour to survive, the service economy is preferable. There are no less jobs available, they are just jobs that are, on average, less terrible.

So close with rants like this, yet still so far. The take away is always milquetoast, that ""we just need changes within capitalism to fix this, because I don't like that the third world worker takes jobs from my people."" Yet as long as we're under capitalism, you are actually hugely benefiting from that, not losing anything.

In a way, you're right, though. Imperialism (late stage capitalism) props it self up by plundering the third world, which has stretched the buying power of your wages. 

purposefully destroying edible food, mothballing goods that won't be sold profitably enough, and terrorizing people for cheap labor and raw material is is evil. Dividing up oversized houses into apartments or civic buildings is expropriating the expropriators. 

But of course this is ignoring there are at least 5 or so empty houses for every one homeless person, and urban blight leaves dilapidated and abandoned buildings unused in densely populated areas. Urban blight was caused by White Flight and banks refusing to work with cities, forcing austerity and breakdown of services. The difficulty in poor oppressed people in getting a housing or business loan created a perpetual poverty machine, kicked into overdrive by aggressive policing and the prison industrial complex. The US imprisons more people than USSR did in gulags. That's not including secret black sites, run by either police or a fed intelligence agency.

The article also said that after Neanderthal DNA was discovered in Europeans it was suggested that it was a possible source of European superiority which is just silly. Neanderthals never came close to creating civilization in the some 600 thousand years they were around and anatomically modern humans did it in less than 80 thousand.
