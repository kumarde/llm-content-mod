I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

Of course there is. You just gave a huge list of reasons.

Your logic doesn't follow. ""Biting your nose?"" This is about people spoofing to enhance their experience in the game because they are getting crappy spawns and don't have any pokestops or gyms near them. 

I think spoofing should be punished, and Niantic will be banning the new wave of spoofers soon enough. However, I can empathize with why they spoof and I don't fault them for it. ",pokemongo,1

"Just got one for my second account I used for Smart Poke 2 (for those unaware, it was an app like PokéVision that showed Pokémon locations). Luckily it's not my main account. 

However, I still think it's a load of bullshit. Yes it's a breach of the TOS but let's take off our everything-is-black-and-white glasses for a second. The primary function of this game is to go around and catch pokemon. There is currently no way to search for pokemon because Niantic has not fixed the tracker for... How many weeks now? These side apps kept the app alive for me. I haven't played much since they got taken down because it's just not fun if you have no idea what you're looking for. 

Now here we are, Niantic is going full hostile takedown of anybody who used these apps. I don't know how much of their 11-man resources they're devoting to this, but according to them, they can't even make a fucking Facebook post because their noses are in their screens writing code so much, yet apparently they have time to go after people trying **make their unplayable game fucking playable** instead of fixing it. 

It pisses me off the way they're treating their players and it's not making me want to come back any more. Niantic is seriously unfit to be running a game of this magnitude.

"Try some reading comprehension instead of acting like a child that heard an opinion he didn't like. It's not hard to figure OP meant he doesn't agree with them being basically behind a 90% paywall where you have to splurge on incubators just to get the new ones. 

Suburban/rural players don't have tons of gyms for free coins so this sucks for them even more.

(yes there is 1 infinite incubator so I'll mention it before the fanboys pile on with ""BUT ITZ FRE!!!!!!"")

The entire point is this game has already made hundreds of millions of dollars with a smattering of improvements. They didn't need to put it behind an artificial pay wall but they did anyway.

You can applaud their addition of content while at the same time being annoyed with them for being greedy assholess even though they've made their money back hundreds of times over.

"The grinding for these dratini candies was sooooo worth it.... I spent majority of my time in the canals of a place in birmingham (supposedly has more canals than venice lol).... The canals were known for its dratini spawns considering it's a water biome... so caught and farmed the usual magikarps, psyducks, goldeens, poliwags, tentacool, slowpokes, krabbies, staryu and sometimes the occasional omanyte, kabuto and even a gyarados and dragonair if the I was lucky. Must have farmed thousands of candies for each but dratini was more of a grind since there was only a few known spawn points and at times even for hours there would be no dratini's... sometimes when they spawned, they would be loads spawning together which was quite exhausting as I had to run from end to end in the canals hahaha... met a lot of people, familiar faces from seeing them everyday farming dratini's and it was great seeing everyone directing where dratini's were, made hunting easier since fastpokemap was down... great thing about this canals was that it was close to a park which was a charmander nest so I was alternating between catching charmanders and dratini's...

This game might be good for preparing low-skill workers for a monotonous job and life, such as a fry cook. I can see the parallels between walking around waiting for that pidgey to spawn, and when it does, to perform some simple action (catching the pidgey) and then repeating 2000 times. It's just like when the fry-cooker at McDonald's makes the ""ding"" sound, and then the worker *walks* over and pours the fries into the fry-pit thing.

"here's answers to all the annoying questions people keep asking


Blue glow around a captured pokemon=recently captured

Pink flowers/glow around pokestop=someone's put a lure there

Tapping the map and getting that blue circle doesn't do anything

Doesn't matter if you evolve a pokemon first or upgrade it first, you get the same end cp.

Weight/size and moves change when evolving. It seems random.

Less footsteps=pokemon is closer, more=further

Grass poofs mean pokemon are more likely there, but not guaranteed

There is a speed cap on the egg counting distance, you can't drive around to incubate eggs

If you see a silhouette you don't recognise just go catch it, and if it's a circle looking thing it's a bloody goldeen

You need constant access to GPS (or GLONASS I suppose) and constant access to either mobile data or wifi

Yes the servers might be done, No nobody on here can tell you we don't work for niantic

Yes everybody knows that gym battles sometimes get stuck at 1 hp, it's a bug now shut up about it.

Incense only affects you, lures affect anybody within the vicinity

Everyone is experiencing the 1HP glitch occasionally, deal with it

You have to level a gym up by training at it to add a Pokemon

You cannot do *anything* with a Pokemon you leave at a gym until it gets kicked out by a rival trainer

And seeing as since I shared, a fair few people have also had the courage to post their story, I feel I've also helped others.

>too thick to predict the problem

They never had these problems with Ingress. They said it themselves, they had no idea it would become so popular. Because it got so much attention they had to approach things more cautiously.

>people have every right to be pissed

No they don't. Niantic want us to enjoy the game but sometimes sacrifices must be made in order to keep the company afloat. Remember also that Nintendo has many conditions for the game that Niantic have to abide by. Niantic can't just do everything as they want.

>refuse to spend their enormous profits on hiring

How do you know they aren't hiring? There's job applications on their website and we know they now have a community manager as well. Finding the right person for the jobs they need is no easy task. You say it like you can just throw money at someone and you magically find the perfect for the job. Wake up, you stupid cunt.

>lack of communication

I'll give you that one. They don't talk much. But it's A LOT better than before. They're quite active on twitter and they have change logs on their site.

"As someone in a similar boat, I've had a lot of things in my body shit the bed, I understand how you feel. 

You're not alone. At all. Niantic surely didn't consider us in this process, and that's fine - but they built it, and we came. They have to know people like us, even without the physical issues, can still find a way of connecting people together. 

To wit, just last night I was on a delayed walk with my dogs. It was decidedly late and I made a choice to do a bit of extra walking and hit a pokestop on a corner near where I lived. 

As I was walking back, someone came up beside me and said something about if I was playing Go. I can't remember exactly because it was almost midnight and while my brain logically said to itself ""oh, this person is a friend! They like Pokemon, too! This will be a nice end to your day!"" My lizard brain caused me to spazz out and respond ""oh Jesus!"" and my body put my right hand to my chest. It's good to know my fight or flight is just spot on. 

Anyway, we talked for a decent while. He's a dad as well, helps in his community with other young dads, and we share tons of similar interests with games, movies, TV (except dexter. I think he liked that all the way to the end. I can forgive some things.) and it reminded me WHY I am still playing the game. 

But he had just updated and hadn't realized they'd killed pokevision and any 3rd party trackers. 

He's level 15 so it's early enough that the problems don't rear their heads fully, but this game WILL lose even those people if they don't correct their shit. 

But keep strong, there are still good results that can come from this. As frustrated as I am, I try and remind myself why I am still playing. Why it's still fun. But if this goes, because people get fed up, it's going to be an empty shell. And hey, if you ever need to vent, shoot me a PM. And take care. Fight the fight. It may never get easier, but if you continue to fight,  pain cannot win. ",pokemongo,1

[http://blogs.lawyers.com/attorney/education-law/good-vibrations-a-case-law-update-on-cell-phones-in-schools-9429/](Summary of a couple cases that actually went to court regarding Cell Phone Confiscation in Schools.) Or for those not willing to read that.

**Klump v. Nazareth Area School District 2006:**

* Background, a students phone was confiscated, while the phone was confiscated the student received a text message pertaining to a drug deal.

* Result in favor of the student. 

* Why ""The student's 4th amendment (search and seizure amendment) were violated, noting that although *the district did have the right to seize the phone under school policy.* They didn't have the right to access the information on the phone.  Because the school had no justification for a search (seeing the text message) it was deemed an unreasonable search.

* How this pertains to what I said: SCHOOLS CAN CONFISCATE PROPERTY, BUT THEY CANNOT SEARCH IT.


**Kock v. Adams 2010**

* Background: Student had their phone confiscated and held onto it for TWO WEEKS.

* Result: School Won.

* Why: ""The district has broad discretion to direct the operation of the schools, and that the courts have no power to interfere with school district decisions unless there is a ""clear abuse"" of that discretion.""  The school policy stated that phones would be confiscated and returned at the end of two weeks.

* How this pertains to what I said: SCHOOLS CAN CONFISCATE PROPERTY, BUT THEY CANNOT SEARCH IT.

**Price v. New York City Board of Education 2008**

* NYC board of education panned the possession of cell phones.  Parents argued phones are a vital communication tool and needed for student safety.

* Result: Court refused to overturn the districts ban.

* Why: The district had a rational basis for implementing the policy (schools are legally allowed to implement policy that prevent distractions in the class room), the district was within its power to make the decision and the courts had no authority to interfere.

* How this pertains to what I said: SCHOOLS CAN CONFISCATE PROPERTY IF IT IS DEEMED DISRUPTIVE TO THE CLASS ENVIRONMENT.

There are cases in California as well, they say the same thing.  Schools can take and hold onto property they can't search it.

There are cases in Florida, guess what?  Schools can take and hold onto property they can't search it (this one has a pretty high profile case.

Texas?  SAME SHIT.


TL:DR Schools do have a legal right to confiscate your phone, or other electronic if they have the policy implemented.  They are not allowed to search the device.  Not liking what I said is not going to change that what I said was accurate and well supported.",pokemongo,1

"Teresa Palmer plays Rebecca in LIGHTS OUT. She left home and her childhood behind. Her little brother Martin is experiencing the same thing she went through as a child which are unexplained terrifying events that seem to happen whenever the lights go out. Turns out, a mysterious entity, later identified as DIANA, has been attaching herself to their mother all those years.
Towards the middle of the movie, Rebecca finds out that dated back her mom's childhood year, the mom met Diana at a mental hospital and later became besties. Diana has skin disease and her skin is sensitive to light. She turned into ashes when the docs turned on the lights to investigate her illness. So, that's why Diana has been attached to Rebecca and Martin's mama all of this time.
There are a few scenes that'll make you jump, but not as scary as Insidious or The Conjuring. One of the scenes that made me jump was the first night in Rebecca's place where she woke up in the middle of the night thinking that Martin was carving something by her doorway. This movie reminds me of the horror movie MAMA (2013). In my opinion, I prefer Mama over Lights Out. At the end of the movie, Rebecca and Martin's mom shot herself in the head because that is the only way to stop Diana from torturing her kids. Without the mom, Diana will not exist.

"The coins were invested in the account of a game which was advertised to be a certain way.  Now that the game is no longer as advertised, the investment (long term) is wasted because the player does not want to play a different game from that which they signed up for.  When players spend the coins they are investing in the long-term (incense, lures, inventory space, etc.).  It does not give them a short term reward that disappears.  I still have the Pokemon that I caught using Incense, lures and incubators, which were intended to be used for or to benefit my game play in the long-term, but I no longer want to play the game because the company changed it and removed features that it initially advertised which drew me in as a player, so those Pokemon attained through my coins are meaningless to me and I am not benefiting from having gotten them because I am no longer playing the game I signed up for.

"When leveling up to like 25 everyone was getting bulk revives and potions every few hours of gameplay, now average level is like 27 or something probably it takes several days to level up, so now they need to get them from Pokestops, so you need to spin Pokestops in a concentrated area for a hour for like 10 minutes of Gym time. 

If Niantic doesn't want gyms to all be sitting on level 10 as they are now they need to do something about how common it is to get a potion. Maybe even make potions heal a certain HP (eg 100hp, 200hp) as they do now but if you use it to heal a Pokemon 30hp only a certain percentage of the potion is actually used. 

Every gym in my city that I see is level 10 aside from maybe 1% of them that are in a contested area like a school or shopping center.

It's not because the players don't exist, if I put the effort in to crush a level 10 gym if I check it the next day it's either back where it was at level 10 or my team have powered it up to level 10, it's just people look at a l10 gym and can't be fucked when they consider all of the potions they will need to burn through to take it down, in comparison if you find a level 9 gym you can power it up with 2-3 potions only and add your pokemon.

The conclusion was, of all the things observed, choice of ball and the size of the ring was that the only thing that affected the catch rate.

I live by water and never see Eevees but Eevee is by far my most common egg hatch from 10k with no water Pokemon such as Lapras or Dratini. I also see Aerodactyl many times per day and I'm yet to hatch one. However, let's assume that the biome does affect your capture.

"The game is a typical grind. Similiar to slot machines actually. It compells you to spend time giving you rewards. First many rewards, you get a lot of stuff in the beginning. Then the rewards get a lot rarer, you are about as happy about your third 2800 CP Dragonite as you were about your first Rapidash at 1200 CP. The levels even indicate that, with a huge hook in the beginning and then longer and longer steps later.

Second point is money. The game compells to spend a little to gain stuff. Those eggs help you save time. Those incubators help you get to the Pokemon you want faster. Overall, usually I think people spend 5 to 10€ on Pokecoins. But in the long run it's similiar to the coins you throw into slot machines. One coin at a time, but over a lengthy period it accumulates quite drastically.

So, for me, there is nostalgia. I had cards (I still have my folder and especially the holo Charizard that made famous at school for a week :) ) and I watched the series like crazy, at least for Gen1 and Gen2.

"No the defending pokemon does not always use it's charge move as soon as its available. I'm not sure how the AI decides which move to use, but I know for certain that they do not use the charge move immediately when it's available. 

For example, oftentimes defending Exeggutors will spam the quick move, and then attack with 2 seed bombs in a row, rather than using the first seed bomb as soon as its available. ",pokemongo,0
"The catch mechanic is just plain broken.  Why do starters become more difficult to catch as you level up but give the same exp?  Why do they have bullshit defensive moves to knock the ball away when they can just break free 90% of the time anyway?

I was in a similar situation when I got my 1st one. Didn't get it until mid to late 20's currently level 29. As soon as it hatched I powered it up! Within a couple of days I got a 2nd 1 with better moves and slightly better IV. Wish I'd saved the candy to power up the 2nd even more.

At L20 if you want to startdust it to L30 it will cost 91k dusts. That means you need to catch 910 pokemons just to level that up.

Drop the notion that hatched eggs are good and start catching the wild ones. Which means fuck the incubators.",pokemongo,0

"&gt;  I end up throwing 5 curves, 2 'nice and 2 'great'.

This is what I'm talking about when I say you're throwing wrong. If you hit a ""nice"" you're throwing at the wrong time, and if you hit a ""great"" you're jumping the gun. *Where* you hit doesn't matter, how big the circle is *when* you hit does. If the circle is big enough for a ""good"" or ""great"" bonus you're throwing at the wrong time. See [PokeAssist catch chance for numbers.](https://pokeassistant.com/catchchance?locale=en)

A lower level catching more often than a higher level makes *perfect* sense since the higher level will encounter things with lower catch rates (as they spawn higher level).
