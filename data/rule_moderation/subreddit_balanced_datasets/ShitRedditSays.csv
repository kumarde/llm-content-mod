"okay, I don't really know how most of this pertains to the conversation at hand, which is that the average rapist cannot be assumed to be a man considering the fact that according to the Time Magazine's report about the CDC: ""women rape men as often as men rape women."" I'm not arguing a case for rape on either side, I'm saying that it's not fair to assume man as a rapist when women are equally capable and are probably equal contributors to rape. The reason you mainly hear about Men-on-women rape is because of the culture that has formed and the fact that men are not as likely to report rape as women, who are already very unlikely to report it. Each of your studies has to do with men's views on raping women. I don't see how that correlates at all to the discussion. It seems to me that you are now just trying to depict men as monsters who have extremely violent and aggressive undertones towards women in order to further your point that the average rapist is a male. Psychology aside, that point may not be true.",ShitRedditSays,1

This is today's rape culture!! Claiming every sexual encounter is rape.  And it's a shame too because, more and more, actual rapes are being ignored because the word has lost all meaning.

There was a story not too long ago about a girl that told a guy we're not having sex tonight.  He starts to make out with her, and I guess in her warped mind, she didn't want to become a rape victim, so she *enthusiastically* had sex with him.  Then wondered of she'd been raped.  Great.

In general viewership for Men's Soccer is significantly greater than Women's, and the men's league makes much more money than the women's league. The Men's FIFA World Cup in 2014 reached 3.2 billion viewers for the final. Compare that to the ""record breaking"" Women's World Cup that topped out at 750 million. The 2014 World Cup (men's) made $4.8 billion in revenue and turned a $2.6 billion profit. The latest Women's World Cup we have revenue figures on was in 2011, and it was a ""financial success"" by making a total revenue of $57 million. 

So simply by virtue of being in a league that makes significantly more money, doesn't it stand to reason that the US Men's Team brings in more revenue than the US Women's team, even if the Women's team is relatively better (compared to the competition) than the Men's team.

I mean, you don't expect WNBA players to make as much money a NBA players, do you?

"All 14 year olds are different. By 14 I thought I knew everything about sex and relationships. I had a fake ID, went to bars, told men I was 18 and had 'relationships' with them.

I honestly don't blame the men in those situations as there is no way they could have known my actual age, I even had the ID to 'prove' I was older. 

I wasn't going to school and was doing drugs. I certainly wasn't behaving in a typical way for a 14 year old. It's certainly not a time in my life that I'm proud of.

What I'm trying to say is we don't know this girls situation. We don't know the details so we shouldn't judge any of the players involved without them. From what other users have said, it's likely the whole story is fake anyway so all of this is merely speculation.

This isn't a paying gig,  they don't even get hotel rooms,  in reality MADD charges in excess of $1000 an hour for these talks at schools and these unfortunate mothers are simply used as crying props moved from city to city.  When they become burnt out they are replaced.  MADD has a dreadful reputation in how they take advantage of the mothers they claim to represent.

This was posted IN RESPONSE TO SOMEONE CALLING FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST PEOPLE THEY DISAGREE WITH. Have fun in the discourse gutter with the Trumpites you smug, classist naive privileged bunch of shits. 

You want to dismantle the patriarchy and white supremacy? Guess what? Acting like a bunch of pretentious assholes from within your echo chamber while avoiding any actual discussion or engagement **doesn't fucking work**.

You think a single mother barely scraping by working two part-time jobs trying to feed her kids gives a shit about your nine-page essay on ""addressing the pervasive nature of fat-shaming"" or the bullshit buzzfeed article you shared on Facebook. Look at theses ten racist tweets we found and screen-shotted and slapped a click-bait headline on. Can you believe that we were able to find ten racists on Twitter?! 

The great irony of this subreddit is the overt privilege that's almost always on display in a subreddit that's supposed to mock the overtly privileged. 

There's a nazi in the white house. One of Trumps closest advisors is literally a white supremacist. But no one cares. You know why? Because the left has spent the last fifteen years using the word ""white supremacist"" to describe everyone from Katy Perry to Ben Carson and now when someone points out that there's a LITERAL WHITE SUPREMACIST IN THE WHITE HOUSE no one fucking listens. 

Anyway you can ban me now. I know you're afraid of people that disagree with you so have at it <3

You could start treating women as people instead of an alien species that you sometimes get to fuck if you play your cards right.
