"File a report... Niantic will do nothing about it.

File another report... Niantic will do nothing about it.

"It's a bug. The game is locked to 30 fps. For me, ever since the beginning I have had random moments where the game shoots up to 60, and it feels amazing, but it's clearly a glitch as animations, particles and physics are made for 30 fps. Niantic, being as dumb as they are, seems to have made ball throwing force related to the Delta of something between two frames (instead of time), so when trying to catch at 60 fps you'll see the ball tends to overshoot and go into space.",TheSilphRoad,1
Why put grass around the pokemon if you can only catch most of them in the city ? Wake up Niantic,TheSilphRoad,1
Thanks OP! Now i know a good place to spoof /s,TheSilphRoad,1

Don't know. I tried the one on PokeAssistant.com but it didn't seem to take candies gained from evolutions into account... so I just made my own. ,TheSilphRoad,1
"There we go. **Which rule did he break, specifically?** 

*Is there a Google Play developer rule that says you will always obey everything written in any other Google Play developer's App TOS?*

Because if so I can release an app tomorrow that will consist of a text field that accepts a Play Store URL and a Submit button. My TOS will say that any Play Store URLs that are submitted to my App are in violation of my TOS, and that their developers agree to remove their app from the Play Store, or have disciplinary action taken against them by Google or their parent company, Alphabet, Inc. 

*Is there a Google Play developer rule that says you can't access another developer's content without their explicit permission?* 
If so I'd like to suggest that we demand Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, YouTube, Gmail, and most especially Google Search be removed from the Google Play store, as they are all facilitating the use of the restricted IP of hundreds/thousands of other rights holders and developers. The Apple Developer agreement specifically disallows use of promotional photos of Apple products without their written approval unless they are being used in an official approved capacity, in a very limited set of circumstances. Each and every picture of an iPhone or iPad or Apple Watch that appears in a Google Images search is breaking that TOS, and any developer/publisher/system that isn't actively blocking google image web crawling on assets that have legitimate cause to use Apple's restricted use developer assets is violating Apple's TOS. And Apple has apps on the Google Play store, which means, you guessed it, all of those apps have to go, and so do all apps released by the developers of those apps, too, because the developer account has to be terminated. 

Or is there a different set of rules when a big giant company like Nintendo, working with a large, former Google developer like Niantic, decide they want to make an example out of someone?",TheSilphRoad,1
Rares have dried up too. Any joy I had left in this game is gone. ,TheSilphRoad,1

What about the areas with no stops? Again a kick in the teeth for rural players. :(,TheSilphRoad,1
"Finally the update i wanted

* Minor text fixes",TheSilphRoad,1
"This is a horrible design decision for players who actually did gyms all day, and defended their territory.  Mathematically speaking it is impossible to defend a gym of any level or composition now, without a 3:1 defender to attacker ratio and the defenders all have to be getting max prestige with half cp trainers and maximum dodging skill.  The attacker just has to be level 20 at least and mash the screen mindlessly to win that race.

This update has sucked the only competitive aspect of the game out - there was already no point to levelling up your Pokemon to be better defenders, since anyone level 25+ could already take a gym down easily of any level.

The game is now reduced to people taking turns collecting their 10 coins and never touching gyms again for the rest of the duration of their cooldowns.  Some players will still just bum rush their ten gym rewards like they did the first month but gym participation is basically pointless now.

Good job Niantic ",TheSilphRoad,1

"I will put it easy for you... Buy some Lucky Eggs, buddy with a Pidgey, Caterpie, Weedle (whatever is most common for you) and GRIND!!!!!!!

You are 14K XP away from 23... 

Level 20-24 = 350,000XP

Level 24-27 = 540,000XP

**Level 27-30 = 900,000XP**

To put it simply, you are going to be kicking yourself when you get to level 28 and need 300,000XP just to get to Level 29. Use this time to catch, buddy and hatch as many candies as you can, get enough Evo fodder to utilize 3-4 lucky eggs and blow through some levels. You could probably easily (if you do it right) get to level 26-27. 

Then, once you get to 27, your CP cap goes up, you find higher CP wild Pokémon and BAM you catch a 700CP Eevee! You evolve it into a 2050-2150CP Vape, which blows your 1780CP Vape out of the water, and you haven't spent any Dust in the process. ",TheSilphRoad,1

"Since this Horrible update, my current community of 17,000+ strong in Las Vegas has compiled and confirmed our newest list of 38 nests in the local areas surrounding Las Vegas!

My question is how in the World(pun intended!) does Niantic expect people to randomly walk around the World gathering Pokémon, without a Proper map tracking system to narrow the search fields down to a reasonable area???

Granted pokevision ""may"" have been a ""little"" too detailed, and real time, for the creators liking, but as Many users have proven(over 77%, on Pokevisions poll on twitter, and the apps rating plummeting!) they hate the app now, and will Not even play the game without a viable option of narrowing our search to a reasonable area!!!

I'm not against making a profit, yes even in a so called ""Free to Play"" game. But Pathetic Greed causing you to change the game(making everything Much harder to catch and taking away tracking) which essentially forces people to ""Pay to Play""(reasonably/worthy play anyway), should be illegal!!! I already supported the game with my $100.00 when it was Fun to play because of the viable tracking(of sites like pokevision), but now I demand my money back for them screwing over us loyal and paying users!!! #BoyCottPokemonGoForNoTracking Proper tracking too, Not that Pathetic(Very Limited) 3 step, no directional, excuse for Very Limited tracking!

Not to mention the interaction range(our pulsing circle) Needs to be increased by double! To help keep people off private properties, and out of dangerous places!!!",TheSilphRoad,1

"Using this tool, you can get a rating for your Pokémon:
https://thesilphroad.com/research

But there's a little too much guess work. Specifically, Step 2, ""positioning the CP arc"". You eyeball it so it matches your screen on your phone, and then verify by checking the stardust and candies are the same. People then narrow it down by powering up the Pokémon, narrowing the range of possible matches.

**Well, there is a better way.** I created a template using GIMP (http://www.gimp.org) photo editing program. Simply print the template, cut out with a pair of scissors (laminate, if you like), and hold the template up to your screen. It can be a little tricky not to scroll your screen while you do this, but you quickly get the hang of it.

I recently scanned through all ~220 Pokémon that I had in my bag (this still took a couple hours), to determine their strength using the Pokémon Rater here on SilphRoad. I didn't have to feed any candies to figure out their exact level. Simply used the template (disclaimer: if it is a level 1 or level 1.5 mon, you may still have some ambiguity).

Here's a picture of a couple templates I made (a unique template is required for every Trainer Level):

"I think Niantic's business model is this: Bring folks in with the Nostalgia, get a few bucks out of them for a few weeks, then ratchet up the grind so bad that players quit and they won't scare away more new players. 

No snark intended. I really think this is their philosophy. To me at level 28, it just feels like the game wants me to go away already. All the changes they have made recently don't feel much like changes at all. My catch rates seem as bad as it ever was, even with all these gold medals. No buddy should create candy at 1 per 5km. The buddy system actually got me walking less because the incentive felt so poor that it discouraged me from playing at all. The tracker issues, of course. Shutting down 3rd party mapping. Yadda, yadda. 

I've only ever played one other mobile game that made me feel I wasn't wanted, and that was Star Wars: Uprising, which is shutting down next month due to poor revenue. They launched an incomplete product that was all grind and offered very little incentive to spend money. It was a game that relied almost entirely on it's license to drive interest, while delivering a game that just wasn't very fun. It feels so damn similar to Pokemon Go. 

You know, I was going to say, ""at least PoGo doesn't rely on gambling to get players spending,"" and then realized that incubators are pretty much that. We're all just hoping that the next egg we find will be a 10k, or the next 10k egg we hatch won't be an eevee. ",TheSilphRoad,1

"Yeah there's plenty they should add, obviously. But From what I've seen since launch so far, it is not worth my money. Yet.

I can't financially support a game that is so woefully incomplete. These aren't up and coming Devs on steam or kickstarter who actually need the money to finance the game. Niantic is a bunch of billionaires by now.",TheSilphRoad,1

"Niantic are making a lot of changes, they recently updated their API too.",TheSilphRoad,1
"Yes, necessary detail to add.

I feel like it is Niantic decision only wheter it does or not. Since phone uses GPS any way, and sends coordinates to server, it is up to them how to interprete these coordinates.

Just watched CEO's talk, he focuses on walking/fitness when talking about wearables. Would be really strange if their ""store brand"" device will work against it, not tracking distance.

May be all that sites mean that PoGo+ itself does not track distance? No shit, Sherlock!

May be my wishful thinking...",TheSilphRoad,1
"Hey, I'm updating my site (https://pokemon-go-dps-optimizer.herokuapp.com/) to calculate this as soon as I get home today! ",TheSilphRoad,1
"Defending Pokemon have a two-second delay before each attack, essentially adding 2000ms to all of their attack times. This makes attacks that already have long strike-times proportionally more favorable. So:

The DPS of Dragon Claw, on defense, is 35/3.5s= 10. 
The DPS of Dragon Pulse, on defense, is 65/5.6= 11.6.",TheSilphRoad,1
What about Wadiya? Aladdin or Aladdin?,TheSilphRoad,1
"Yeah, cities just have so much stuff...

I was in Tokyo during the PoGo launch. Their parks are stacked with stops. They have so many interesting things in those parks, like bench 1, bench 2, bench 3, and even bench 4. Some even have street light 1, street light 2, and street light 3. Quite a few had bike stand 1, bike stand 2, and so on.

I am not suggesting that rural/suburban areas have as many attractions that would qualify for stops as cities, but the sheer amount of everyday things that qualify for a stop in cities but not in suburban and rural areas is just completely annoying. In Tokyo, and other big cities, almost anything can be a stop, whereas in rural and suburban areas not even actual attractions are a stop.",TheSilphRoad,1
"They wouldn't, would they?! 
Yeah they would.",TheSilphRoad,1
"FFS!

First they gave us Trump and now this!

"So completing a Pokedex is pointless now?

Having a 100% catch rate for a specific Pokemon is going to be impossible moving forward (I know it's a silly accomplishment)?

BUT we still don't have a *good* in-game tracker and all tracking services no longer work...

I played Ingress for a year and played Pokemon Go since release (and still play it daily) but Niantic needs to focus on implementing a *good* tracker, adding trading, adding additional ways to earn candy (a 5k walk for *one* candy isn't helping that much and not having a Snorlax/Lapras/Dratini-family buddy is silly imo), and implementing legendaries/ditto.",TheSilphRoad,1

"Maybe it's because I'm a long-time Ingress player so I didn't expect things like customer support from Niantic in the first place, but it just looks to me like people are just pissed by:

1) Niantic took away a major way people were cheating, or at least made it more difficult, and

2) a feature is gone (likely temporarily). 

For that, it's all b!tching all the time from so many entitled people. ",TheSilphRoad,1
"a) We need legendaries first.

"Slowbro is a great defender especially if it's Confusion/Psychic or Ice Beam. It has pretty good Defensive scores and very good stamina. STAB on the Psychic moves that very few pokemon can resist. People think that since Slowbro is water type, they can roll up with a grass pokemon, but what they forget is that Slowbro is Water/Psychic type and gets STAB for those quick attacks and most grass pokemon are Grass/Poison (except Tangela and Exeggutor I think) receive super effective damage on Psychic attacks. Also, Exeggutor fast attacks (Zen Headbutt and Confusion) are resisted by Slowbro. And even if you did roll up with a Tangela, Slowbro could hit you with Icebeam. Only real weakness is against Electric/Steel types with electric attacks that can resist psychic and deal super effective damage, which AFAIK is just Magneton. Even an equal CP Jolteon might have trouble attacking without dodging.

Golem is a poor defender right now because it has low HP and receives 2x super effective damage from water and everyone has a strong Vape with Hydro Pump.

Nidoqueen suffers from Poison and Ground typing which means very common Water/Psychic types like Starmie and Slowbro (and Golduck which has Psychic attacks) kick it's ass.

Vileplume and Venosaur has lowish HP and are susceptible to Fire which have high attacks stats in Flareon and Arcanine.

Spawn points removed were in an area open to the public. The players were the ones causing damages, nuisances etc.  Yet Niantic is held responsible cause they placed the spawn points there.

Niantic put this spawn point near a road and causes a potentially dangerous situation if someone plays pogo while driving and gets distracted by the spawn point.The person should be held responsible for any damages caused since it was their choice but is this legally the case?

"I know and can see where you're coming from but actually I think you're attitude is kind of a bit like how Niantic behave, a sort of ""I made this and you'll behave how I want with it"" feel. People are grumpy for good reason. One of them is the endless smiley positivity of the Niantic messaging. If they put out messages saying ""we have heard this and this and this from the community. We know people are unsatisfied with this and this and this. And therefore these things are our priority for fixing and working on, but if the community needs something more urgently perhaps we can be a bit flexible."" Instead what you get is John Hanke endlessly repeating ""I saw a person - let's make it a child or an old person or a disabled person, or anyone who is routinely patronised or treated as though they require sympathy - having a wonderful time walking in the park. Isn't it a beautiful thing."" What you have to understand is the negativity you describe isn't a response just to the game but to the endless positive messaging surrounding a fundamentally broken product. If Niantic haven't worked out how not to provoke this they should actually hire the global community manager they promised 2 months ago. 

How does this relate to TSR? Well, obviously one of Niantic's current strategies for weathering the storm is to always appeal to an ""enormous mass"" of ""casual players"" who aren't like the people at TSR. Actually I don't believe such a mass of casual players exists - I suspect strongly that the vast majority of play hours and income comes from people playing pretty seriously and frequently (that is what happens when you build a game that is so grind-intense, people either quickly quit or play seriously.) I think it's fine for a community of people who do try to play the game not just casually - and fun doesn't have to be casual - to express a level of negativity. I certainly don't think that negativity makes TSR a bad place. Much prefer it to smug smiles and people telling me to be more positive, personally.",TheSilphRoad,1

The lack of a constant for health growth is one tiny part of the equation missing. The lack of an EV growth factor is another.

I think the smaller screen size might in effect allow me to throw the ball faster as my finger has less distance to travel on a 5 versus a 7 which could be a factor in the game recognizing some of my curve balls. Another important detail is the game is mostly not recognizing my curveballs for Pokémon which are at a medium or far distance from me, so very inconsistent for things like a zubat, but generally fine for like a nidoran.

There is a reason you go a little slowly, not crawl, but you learn muscle memory, the numbers go up and going level, by level, waiting to evolve fully until you have enough candy to take the best one to it's fully evolved state takes longer, but the learning curve is less steep. You have to re-learn how to catch now. I am noticing this as I level up. I am also more determined to get better. I just jumped, or will in an hour, so close, from 28 to 29 in a week of really determined, only in time off, play. I know once I hit thirty, it will be a new game and my strategy has to change. I know I got serious about things at level twenty. More careful with my resources, except the overwhelming need to spend stardust as soon as I get it, Doh! 

Think of it as a new game now. You are not in elementary school and the homework is harder. You will need to throw better.

Actually, seriously this is the best answer to this question - just try and open a conversation with the people that are around.

* If you see a level 1-3 gym and no one in the area, it's cool to put something in. If there really is a group of three who just cleared that gym, training another 2000 prestige should not be a problem for the four of you.
* if you see a level 4+ gym with an empty spot, wait at least 20 seconds unless you really see no person around (this obviously requires a gym in a park or somewhere without housing that might hide people from view) 
* if you see a gym only has strong defenders in it, don't add that cp 150 kakuna from your last mass evolve as a throwaway. 
* if the pokemon you add to a non-level 10 gym is the lowest cp one, don't put in a low level S-tier defender.

"I haven't kept up with all the new terms for different types of spawns, and still refer to every consistent spawn point that has changed pokemon during a migration as a nest. Nest was just a made up term we coined (remember tall grass?) anyways, and the additional terms just make it even more confusing and open to misinformation, imo.

With that said, i definitely have some nests (parks that were covered in glowing goo during the beta) near me that only produce spawns at night, and some even more specific.

There is a park that was a voltorb nest during the last phase, and during that time it would only spawn maybe 2 or 3 voltorbs an hour tops, across a large area. And the first one would always pop as soon as the game shifted to night mode. It never spawned any during the day.

With the most recent spawn point change we've acquired some new rare spawn points that are harder to classify.

One such is a parking spot on campus that consistently spawns semi rares for the area. Vulpix, scyther, growlithe, etc. But for about 5 hours every night it will only spawn omanyte, of which ive only ever seen one wild spawn in the whole city. And theyre always double spawns (30 minutes.)

There is another spot that doesnt spawn anything all day, but from around 10pm to 1am every night it will spawn magnemites (they dont spawn here at all, seem to only be acquired via eggs from a specific pokestop.) Anywhere from 1 to 5 in that time period. Sometimes 2 at once. They are always in the exact same spot (right on a gym where theyre really hard to hit), even when it's 2 of them, theyre ontop of eachother.

We also have a single spawn point near my house that has only ever spawned the pokemon for its nest. One an hour most of the time. Dont remember what it was originally, whatever turned into ponyta at the first migration. Then it was ponyta, obviously. Then slowpoke (super depressing, ultracommon here.) Now it seems to be psyduck (equally common), and spawning less consistently. But it's just a single spawn point and never alternates pokemon.",TheSilphRoad,0

"This is actually true (at least unless Niantic changed it). 

-

How it works: every Pokemon is assigned a LARGE random number N, say from 0 to 2^64 - 1. The level at which you will encounter the Pokemon is the remainder when dividing that number by your trainer level, where a remainder of 0 will put the Pokemon's level at your trainer level. Any trainer level above 30 is set to 30 in this calculation.

-


How do we know this? Looking at the levels of the same Pokemon caught by people of trainer levels that divide each other. Suppose a level 30 trainer catches a level 23 Pokemon. Then N divided by 30 gives a remainder of 23, and therefore N divided by 15 must give a remainder of 8. And indeed, a level 15 trainer will catch this Pokemon at level 8. ",TheSilphRoad,0

However, in other areas the dominating team is not able to respond as rapidly or does not have the ability to easily train up against a high level defender or is even too selfish to drop in a lower level defender to train the gym up for their teammates.

"Agree with OP's premise. 

This becomes **VERY** obvious just talking to other players IRL about taking gyms. 

Often times I'll find someone else playing, ask team, same as me, cool. ""Hey, wanna go down the block take that gym and level it up?"" 

Almost always the same response: ""nah sorry, I already got my one coin today, not gonna go all the way there for nothing"" 

Most people just doesn't care like some of us do. I personally just think it's fun and I do just for the heck of it. I already got 5 coins today and was still taking and training gyms. That'd what I do the most. I love it. But most people rather catch pidgeys. 

Gyms don't ""stagnate"" because of the gym mechanics. The current mechanics are already faaar in favor of the attacker. Really the only thing stopping any gym from being taken down is someone who just cares to even try to take it down. Gyms stagnate because sometimes, no one cares to try. Only gyms with very low traffic, usually on very low population places that even have this problem. 

Not sure if I agree with all the specific suggestions op has. But any incentives, whatever they are, would come a long way. And to be fair, I'm pretty sure Niantic knows this. This was a problem they talked about in Ingress and eventually added several more incentives. I'm sure similar things will eventually come to Go in time.

It's not fair to expect people who start playing the game now to have to pay for what those of us who played since launch and had time to gather coins when gyms were low levels got for free when it's not some kind of ""early adopter bonus"", but the game being poorly designed and skewed so new players get screwed over. People need to recognize a lot of stuff that has since been taken out (like IDK dratini nests? the fact most of the more powerful pokemon in the game benefited from the IV scale glitch?) gives us an unfair advantage over anyone who starts playing now.

Like with anything else posted here, your experience may be different based on several factors.  If you think that OP is speaking directly to you and insulting you, I suggest you look again.  He is specifically saying that this works in an area like his and may not work for everyone.  I'd say that laying out things that may work for people, some of which might even work for people in different locales, is more productive than saying ""join the dominate team ... profit.""

"Don't ignore one of the main advantages of Bubblestrat: XP. Say you and three friends take over a gym.  You each put a Bubblestrat defender in the gym and then attack it over and over.  Each of you will make about 400 XP every minute.  Stay for an hour and you'll get 24,000 XP.  Use Lucky Eggs and double that: 48,000 XP.  Even if an opposing team comes and attacks the gym, they will not reduce the prestige faster than your team can increase the prestige.  So it's a net gain, you get XP, the opponent gets XP. Win win. And in theory, all without spending any potions. (In practice, you'll probably goof the timing here and there and need to spend a few Revives to keep moving forward. Plus the Revive for your Bubblestrat defender when it does get kicked out of the gym.)",TheSilphRoad,0

If I understand it right, cool down is equal to duration of the move (time between moved starts and time you can attack again). That leaves the 1 second delay to trigger the charge move unaccounted for.

"No more so then adding Generation II, would go as far to say as Generation II would upset more players then the introduction of mega-evolutions. Players are nostalgic about the first generation, and increasingly less so for every generation after that. The first generation are iconic and mostly recognisable. Putting a extra 100 or so mostly unmemorable Pokemon into the game, would cause more confusion and annoyance. 

Mega Evolutions on the other hand, are just a extension of the old favourites, and are immediately recognisable as exactly that. Players are already familiar with the concept of evolution and new forms, and mega evolution would simply be a new, temporary, cool looking form of the pokemon they remember and love.   

The ""less is more"" philosophy is one of the main reason why the game is now losing players, the ease of game play was good for capturing casual... but now they are finding there is nothing left to do, nothing new to strive towards. If the game wants to hold onto players and kept them invested, it is going to have to add depth and complexity. Make the game more engaging. 

Finally, I somehow doubt the ""less is more"" philosophy was a deliberate design decision, Niantic simply run out of time to implement all of the features and functionality they were planning.

"My guess would simply be a random spawn chance.

Why do you even assume that there is a clear systematic behind it?

There is a systematic behind certain spawn point - so you can clearly see in your data that every spawn at x:52 was at the same spawn point. So this spawn point probably has a ~25% chance to spawn a charmander each hour at :52. Sometimes it spawns two hours in a row (2:52 and 3:52), sometimes it doesn't spawn for six hours in a row (4:52-10:52)... That's exactly what you can expect with a random chance of ~25% per hour.

Your data looks like you have several independent spawn points all belonging to a frequent spawn area:

x:18 spawned 9 times

x:39 spawned 4 times

x:49 spawned 10 times

x:52 spawned 7 times

x:57 spawned 8 times

---&gt; On average, with 30 hours of data, this indicated that each of these 5 spawn points spawns a Charmander with a probability of 25% each hour at a set time.

I really doubt that there is a connection to find between the spawn points - the spawn point creation algorithm most likely just creates a bunch of similar spawns in a fitting region (like a park in this example).

To answer your question: Since four out of those 5 spawn points spawn between :39 and :57 (so within a window of 18 minutes) the best time to visit is around :50 each hour. You can still get the first spawn (if it spawned) since it lasts for 15 minutes and get the rest of them as well. If you want to stay there for several hours, i don't think it matter at which time you go there. The data shows spawn throughout the entire day and since it only is one day, you can't use this data to determine if there are more spawns at a certain time of day. But like i said, the chaotic nature of the single spawns (sometimes spawning twice in a row, sometimes no spawn for 8 hours...) makes it seem truly random. And i don't advice you to gather more data, because this data is obviously from leeching the API which i do not support in any way (... and i hope that Niantic goes hard against anyone they catch leeching the API...).",TheSilphRoad,0
"As others have said, you should wait until after you evolve even though it's the same amount of stardust.

That being said, all my attackers are usually 1.2K or less to ensure I get the minimum 500+ prestige without having to use a potion every time (my 808cp dragonair can get 6000+ prestige attacking high CP fire mons while only having to heal it once).

My top mons that are in gyms are Vaporeon (x4) / Dragonite / Victreebel / Nidoqueen / Vileplume / Snorlax / Slowbro / Eggexcutor / Gyrados all between 2.1-2.3KCP.

These gym heads rarely battle, they just earn coins.  The real MVPs are the 1.2K or lower CP pokemon like Dragonair, Hyper Beam Raticates, Seadras and Golducks.

But I like attacking only Instinct gyms because the top trainers in my city really focus on having high quality gyms - to the point where they'll only put pkmn in if they recognize the other trainers in the gym.

1. This is a small sample size. 29 snorlaxes. What, 60 oddish spawns? Estimating since there's overlap. 

2. Snorlaxes are remarkably more likely to be reported. If this is 100% OP's own research, then it seems to be a bias since he's actively looking for those two pokemon and [this](https://xkcd.com/1138/)

3. Depending on region, snorlaxes may be rarer or more common significantly than oddishes. I've seen more oddishes than on this map in my town, yet only a single snorlax. Since this map is implying a mean of 3-1, I can assure you the standard deviation is either too high to matter based on this map or low enough I can pretty much pinky promise my data isn't out of the subset of standard.

"It really depends on who you're attacking.  If they have a quick fast move (like water gun, bite, etc) then you're probably not going to be able to dodge them all regardless of what kind of charge move you have, so you'd focus your charges more around countering theirs instead of trying to use one in between their fast attacks

If they have a slower fast attack (i.e. steel wing, confusion), then you should be able to dodge their attack, start your charge while dodging, use the charge, and recover fast enough to dodge their next fast attack

An example battle from last night; my 18xx Arcanine (bite/flamethrower) vs a 21xx Venusaur (razor leaf/solar beam)

Battle start - immediate bite, dodged the first attack, bite, dodged the second, bite bite, dodged the third, 4x bite (at this point the first flamethrower was already charged and Venusaur hadn't even started his normal rotation)

Dodge fourth attack, use flamethrower, dodge, 4x bite.  Dodge, 4x bite.  Repeat until he used solar beam.  Dodge that, then counter with back to back flamethrowers.  Battle over, remaining HP was around 80%

If it's a fight against someone with a faster charge (like a seed bomb Exeggutor), then I just counter their charge with one of my own, then being able to dodge after.  It's not as fast limiting yourself like that, but it's safer.  You'd use this safer method when you're using something weaker, like a 1k Scyther vs a 2k Exeggutor

Interesting idea but this means that I'll never put my 6 best pokemon in a gym for fear of coming up on a gym that is too strong to take over without them. As things are now I can at least choose the type advantage to compensate for the fact that my main attackers are in a gym.

"You're right that it's my problem and ultimately my choice to keep playing. And I do keep playing because I enjoy it. I live in a very safe residential neighborhood and have been going for runs around here for years now. PokemonGo is an added attraction to my route. 

I ignore the cars and keep battling because I'm used to them now, and I know what to expect with them (they drive past, sometimes idle nearby for a bit, doing I don't know what, but then they move on. I think they wait a while and then come back once I've beaten the gym). 

But just because I tolerate certain players' behavior doesn't mean I'm happy about it. I still don't understand why they appear to rush over just to check up on the gym. I still think it's weird that they ignored my wave, or sat there with their headlights on me. So I would encourage other players not to do things like that, but I suppose even that may be too much to expect. But I'll encourage it anyways.

And per your edit: It's cool, and I try to keep an open mind about these other players. Maybe they really are trying to deter people from taking their gyms, but maybe they just don't realize that it's awkward to sit there with your headlights on when it's still a bit dark out in the morning. I just wish it could be clear to all of us that I'm chill and they are chill too. Hopefully it has been established implicitly at this point.
