I suppose I feel as though, especially with the pastor being his son-in-law (if I understood correctly), that there should be some sympathy. Quite honestly, 300-500/month is what some people pay for rent... that's a LOT of money, in my opinion. They could definitely give less (even half) and still be proud of what they are donating. or if anything, after giving that much every month for so long, they could possibly be receiving some help during their financial difficulties. I know that my moms church usually tries to help people out when they are going through a rough time by donating with their donations. I guess I just feel like they should get some more sympathy rather than feeling judged by god/church members or feeling guilty.

"OP, you can do a few things. 

You can take $1-2,000 and go open a brokerage and auto-debit your checking every month for regular new purchases of a mutual fund. And then go spend $50/mo on term life. 

Or you can get universal life and be covered even if you don't regularly contribute. 

Or you can get whole life (which is probably not the best option). 

Given that you have $250k covering in debt out of undergrad, law, and business school, plus a mortgage, you either live in a very inexpensive area or you have some (but not lots of) family money. You're poor enough to have student loan debt but not so poor that you couldn't come up with a down payment. Your particular situation makes some difference.  We also don't know when you got married and if your wife owes on your loans. 

If you want term, get the longest length you can. You're healthy and young now. Who knows about later. 

If you don't have a lot of money left over every month, i would suggest a universal policy instead. 

If you're balling, i would not take advice from Reddit. 

And by the way - what rate are your student loans? Federal direct loans? At 7%+? These same morons on here telling you to invest would also tell you to pay down your 7% student loans. So since you evidently can't afford to do that, you probably can't afford to poor money into the market right now.

"Fantastic advice. 

I do want to add 1 thing that's worth the thought because I do agree w/ OP, why should your parents benefit from claiming you? However, depending on your relationship with your folks, there are different upsides you should factor in.

Deductions are a very important part of tax time so it's pretty obvious why your parents want to claim you. It reduces their taxable income and could possibly lower their tax bracket. I'm going out on a limb to assume that filed married-joint they out earn you and most likely itemize their deductions on top of their mortgage or any other large expense from installing better windows this year to detrimental medical bills. Having you is just icing on the cake, one that could be a big deal. 

But before you think, oh perfect I can claim myself and benefit, you do have to think what your potential upside is. For you, renting, almost certainly takes you out of the itemized deduction range and so you're stuck taking the standardized deduction which is $6,300 for 2016. Depending on your line of work that might not buy you too much and you may just be getting the taxes back that you've already paid in. For me in college that didn't amount to much.

So, like MadMonk67 said, talk to them first because they may not realize what this could mean for them and it could sway them into thinking - hey why not use this ""free money"" and help you out a little more often. But if your relationship isn't so warm, there's no reason to help someone who simply refuses to help you.

Example, years ago when my wife and I were dating, her mother would charge her for everything including her own made up interest rate. I mean everything. School or dentist or whatever she thought she was teaching her a lesson all the while using her for a cellphone discount. That didn't last long tho haha",personalfinance,1

when you donate to a charity, that is a deduction from your gross income, not your tax bill.

So lets say you earn 50k, and your taxes are 20%, so you owe 10k of tax.

You donate 10k.  

Now your gross income is 40k, assume tax rate is still 20%, so your tax bill is now 7500.

get the idea?

On top of that, the IRS only allows deductions for charitable contributions up to a maximum of 50% of your income.  So you could donate 25k, leave yourself with 25k, and owe the IRS 5k.

Keep in mind your credit is reported to credit companies based on the statement balance. You can pay off your credit card each month but still have bad credit if your total credit card balance when the statement is release is a high percentage of your limit. Going from 5% debt to limit to 30% debt to limit is a 70 point swing all on it's own! It's crazy.

Mine score just went up 47 points because I figured this out and brought my debt to limit from 24% to about 3% just before my statement was release. Now I will always attempt to make it so I get my balance down to 5% or lower just before my credit card statement comes out. (I do always pay the balance each month, use the card for everything though, so that's why it can get high at times).

If that's not the answer then I'm not quite sure what it could be. Good luck finding out. Let us know if you do!",personalfinance,1

It's even easier for foreign students. The wealthy ones do this because the credit companies between their homeland and the US understand there can be unauthorized usage.

Then you make a slightly longer term plan to get the training for a more skilled job, and there are literally hundreds of different things you could try out... Many of them are in healthcare and they pay very well for the 12/18/24 months of part-time classes. Others for trades can be just as good. If you are good with logical thinking and IT, you can literally sign up for a 6month course, get a certificate, and straight up start applying for high paying IT, IT security, web-admin etc jobs.. Some folk I pointed that way are now (after a couple job hops) earning six figure salaries. You have to have a goal and plan though, otherwise you will get lost in day to day stuff. 

Finally, if all the talk about students loans from people in the US scares you, remember that those are mostly for private colleges or the big research universities. There are still thousands of other state universities and community colleges where you can get your degrees for very very cheap. If you make your choices wisely (or keep asking/listening to advice from others, like here on Reddit), you can come out very well without crippling financial stress. 

And trust me, you'll be okay, it'll be good. And you seem to have been very lucky to have an easy way to the US, which happens to be on a very strong upswing after the big recession. Now pull yourself together and start preparing for the future. 

p.s. All the naive little american (and hispanic) girls who go gaga over a European accent will be waiting to welcome you into their pants too if you can keep that depression under wraps :D",personalfinance,1

1. Don't ask for money here - I believe it is against the forum rules. If you are serious hit up some of your family for cash.
2. Work Work Work - Why aren't you working now? Delivering pizzas? McDonalds? If you are desperate enough to ask strangers for money on the internet you should be desperate enough to be working two jobs and eating noodles until you get this money saved up. 
3. Use this time to make super sure this is what you want to do. If you bring him here you are financially responsible for him, even if you split up.

"If you could pass the Enrolled Agents' (EA) exam, the knowledge you gain from studying should adequately prepare you to do a simple to a slightly complex tax return. From a client who has a W-2 income to an independent contractor with a Schedule C with a $60k-$100k income. 

This book covers a lot:

https://www.amazon.com/South-Western-Federal-Taxation-2017-Comprehensive-ebook/dp/B01F7EHGTG/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1478027084&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=southwestern+federal+income+tax+2017+comprehensive

You could also go the H&R Block route. The advantage is you learn  how to deal with clients right away and make mistakes on their dime. But the most important part is they have an Enrolled Agents' exam class that almost guarantees passing the exam. Easiest way to do it. This class is only available to their employees. 

There are also online test preps that are way more expensive. 

As for starting your practice, there are services where you can call a tax pro and ask questions. You can also call the IRS Tax Advocate for more help. However, they're only available during office hours. 

A lot of tax preparers start out by posting an ad at their work. I personally wouldn't feel comfortable with this, but I've seen it work for a lot of people who end up having 100 clients that way. 

If you want to find out what type of expenses each occupation is entitled to, you can go to certain tax preparers' websites where they post worksheets that list the expenses. 

Instead of posting an ad to do someone's return for free, volunteer for VITA. They are affiliated with the IRS and provide free training. They consist of volunteers who are mostly accounting students.

"What I'd recommend is reading about this subreddit for people's opinions on the vanguard life strategy fund (which is essentially a really broad fund that owns a tiny % of a lot of companies in a variety of sectors and countries). It seems to be the 'go to' or 'compare against' fund at the moment for beginner investors. 

With an S+S ISA you set up the isa with a platform/bank (Hargreaves landsdown, Charles Stanley direct, fidelity etc) and then you transfer money into the ISA and then you purchase stocks and shares with the money in the ISA. So for example using HL platform you incur 0.45% costs and the vanguard fund has 0.24% cost on its own so your total expense ratio is 0.69%. The same fund on Charles Stanley direct would be 0.48% (but You might be willing to pay that 0.21% for the simplicity of the HL platform)


* Don't look at funds and see '40% last year so that's bound to make money'. 
* Do think about 'I want to save £500/month now and I want to have £300k when I'm 40, what do I need to do to achieve that?'. This is where you realise how valuable ISAs are once you consider the CGT on 20+ years of compound interest
* Go on HL/Morningstar and look at a fund and learn what every three letter acronym means (lots of googling 'wants the difference between an acc fund and an inc fund?' Etc)
* find a random fund and then look at the total cost of owning that investment on a variety of platforms
* Ask questions on here, it's so valuable
* make a few spreadsheets to see how things grow/develop 
* DONT think that you can predict or time the market. You just can't

"Hi, financial advisor here from Canada. First of all, sorry for your loss, that's truly saddening. 

Find yourself a good lawyer and accountant before you make any decisions. 

As far as the house goes, if you don't plan to live in it, sell it. I don't think renting is feasible because even if you manage to make more than 23K in rent income, it will be added onto your total gross income at year end so I doubt you will turn a profit this way. It's probably best to sell it. 

For the 250K, DONT make the mistake of investing it all in one lump sum. If you do this, you'll be buying at a singular price according to the current market value. In the investment world there's a term called DCA (dollar cost averaging) basically it means if you invest $1000 this month, depending on the market, you will get a different amount of shares every month you invest the $1000 instead of doing all $250K at once during the current market value. This REALLY helps when it comes to risk management and investment return.

I would also look into possibly putting a portion into a seg fund and converting it to a payout annuity when you're ready to retire. Seg funds offer guarantees on capital and can be invested into most anything.

Depending on the 401k plan rules, it can allow you to put up to $30-35k into your Roth IRA per year instead of $5500.

"My advice as a parent of two is to not buy new items.  Go online,  go to a consignment shop,  a thrift store something.  Kids grow out of clothes fast.  Buy a size or two ahead and store it. Same with diapers.  Don't buy newborn diapers.  If your baby wears them it will only be for a few weeks.  Also when people ask what they can give always say diapers,  wipes or gift visas. Tell them if they need to buy clothes for the munchkin buy anything but newborn and to consider the season the child will be in that size.  From a budgeting standpoint and as a previous teen mom,  I would recommend taking a hard look at what you do for fun and impulse shopping.  You need to honestly ask yourself and your SO ""do we need it"" expensive makeup? No. soda? No? A coffee everytime we go out? No.  Buy in bulk and cook your own meals! Don't get the boxed crap,  don't get the premade items. It seems cheap at first but it isn't.  Also if at all possible see if she would be open to getting a part time job on your off hours after the baby is a bit older.  Save the money and she can have some time out of the house.

"Sample: Supposing you are in the 25% bracket.

If you have $6000 of SE profit and your SE tax is 6000 * 0.9235 * 15.3%, you'd anticipate $848 in SE taxes. 

The income subject to income tax would be ($6000 – $424). If you're in 25% bracket, your income tax goes up by 0.25 * $5576 = $1394.

So the effect is you can predict you'll be needing to pay $1394 + $848 more in taxes. 

IRS gives you a break if your total tax minus withholding is under $1000. If your regular job withholding is accurate, though, you'd find (tax – withholding) will likely be over $2000. So you might need to pay in more via withholding or an estimated tax payment.

But your tax in 2015 plays a role. When you do the 1040-ES worksheet, you'll see IRS is okay if you pay in 90% of upcoming tax or 100% of previous year's tax (sometimes 110%), whichever is lesser. So do the worksheet to find out if you escape having to make extra payment now. If you do need to make a payment it won't be the full $2242.

Don't fall into needless spending or materialism just because you can. What's the sense in that? Just keep up your good habits. Purchase nice essentials, like quality underwear that will last awhile, or a good pillow. Boring stuff. No one needs half the crap they buy.

You use the credit card just like any normal credit and make sure to pay the balance off each month. In about 3-6 months of good credit card usuage, you will have established enough credit that you can up the limit amount by giving them more money for the account. You are giving them this money just in case you charge stuff and never pay it back, the bank will take whatever money you have given them in that account. After you have built up enough credit you can then get a ""regular"" credit card with things like cash back or points or whatever you want and the bank will give you back the money you gave them for the student credit card account.

"OK, here's the simplest solution for you, and probably the best one.  It's based upon two assumptions:

1. You're not making shit in salary right now.  You're not even 18, so chances are your income this year, including the $20,000, is going to be oh, **about $20,000**.

2. You don't know what you're going to do with the money.  You might want to go to college.  You might want to buy a house 15 years from now.  You might (almost certainly *will*) want to retire 48 years from now.  The solution I'm proposing allows you to do any of the above with that money.

What you should do is open up an investment account, putting the money into an **S&amp;P 500 Index Fund**.  There are plenty of online investment banks that will let you do this.  I suggest [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/home/) because their fees are extremely low but if you prefer TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, eTrade, or Merrill Edge, none of those are bad options, either.

You go to the web site, open an account, and fund it with $17,000 from the $20,000.  Keep the other $3,000 in your account.  You're (probably) going to need it come April.  Then you purchase stock from one of the *ETF's* (**E**xchange **T**raded **F**unds) that represents the [S&amp;P 500](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0968), or the [entire stock market](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0970).

Then, when tax season comes around, (you did set aside $3,000, right?) in March of 2017, take the paperwork for how you got the $20K, and all your tax information to an accountant.  Or your parents' accountant.  I have no idea how you ended up with this $20,000 so I can't tell you whether or not you're responsible for the taxes on it or if it's tax-free money.  And rather than try to give you (shitty) tax advice over a message board, I strongly suggest you go to an accountant who is willing to be responsible for your tax return.  'Cuz I'm not.  It's entirely possible the accountant will say ""Don't worry, you don't owe any taxes on this money"".  In which case great!  You're now $3,000 richer.

That's my whole advice.  You've put your money into an excellent ETF with extremely low fees, and you're taking advantage of capital appreciation in the stock market.  And the best part is you're starting very early in your life.  Later on you'll have the freedom, if you want, to use that money for a car, house, college education, or rolling it into a Roth IRA, but for now you probably don't know or care what that last thing even is, so don't worry about it.

Just a couple of other things I should mention to you:

1. Don't worry about what the market is doing at any given time.  You're 17 years old.  That means you're probably 2 years away from going to school, 13 years away from buying a house and 48+ years away from retirement.  What do you care if Microsoft is up 0.13% today?

2. Don't, don't, DON'T buy individual stocks.  It's the WORST thing you could do.  There's a reason mechadragon469's comment is being downvoted into oblivio, because it's TERRIBLE fucking advice!  It doesn't matter how much you like any one company, please take my word for it: Investing in a single stock is madness.  Scientists could discover proof that iPhones give you cancer and that Apple stock you just bought could evaporate like a fart in the wind.  When you invest in the entire market you're inured so that kind of volatility.

3. Don't buy mutual funds.  At least not ordinary mutual funds.  Buy ETFs.  The difference between ETFs and mutual funds is quite simple:  ETFs are not managed.  The stocks are chosen at the inception of the fund, and with very few and rare exceptions, they don't change over the life of the fund.  A mutual fund is actively managed.  There's some smart fellow in a tie that buys certain stocks, and decides which stocks to add or remove from the portfolio.  ""But wait!"" you might ask: ""Isn't that better?""  The dirty little secret of investing is **no, it's not better**.  It's actually worse.

The problem is, the market is really, *really* good at valuing a stock.  The market is so good, in fact, that it's almost impossible to actually beat the market.  And that smart guy in a tie I mentioned earlier?  He's not actually better at beating the market than anyone is.  In any given year, about half the mutual funds on the market will actually *underperform* the S&amp;P 500, while the other half will *overperform*!  Now, sometimes you'll 

But you know what DOES matter a great deal?  FEES.  Fees, fees fees.  Fees will eat you the fuck up.  They will drink your milkshake.  And fees are easily avoided, because they come from adding and removing stocks from a mutual fund, from all the trading commissions that those fund managers rack up.  The industry average for mutual fund fees are 1.25%.  By comparison the fees on those Vanguard funds I linked above?  0.05%.  Look at it this way:  If you take 20,000 and you invest it in the S&amp;P 500, which over the past 20 years has been returning ~7.5%, then in 20 years it would be $85,000.  But if you invested it in a mutual fund that matched the S&amp;P 500 performance, only with 1.5% in annual fees, you'd only be ending up with $64,000.

To avoid them, you don't go with actively managed mutual funds.  You just pick some sensible ETF, which should act as a proxy for the entire stock market, and dump all of your $17K in it.  You now have a diversified portfolio of the entire market, at virtually no cost in fees.",personalfinance,0
"It absolutely isn't wrong to ask your Uncle to step up to the plate.

At the same time... most states don't have laws on the books that say your uncle *must* support his parents.  So there is a good chance that your uncle isn't doing anything wrong either (at least in the eyes of the law).

But you should absolutely look up the laws in your state.  They are usually referred to as ""filial responsibility"" laws.  Even if you can only get a little money from your uncle each month, something is better than nothing.

"First, get in touch with an accountant to make sure all your taxes are properly paid for this year.

Also, remember that you may be shocked that a lot of that money will be eaten up by college costs unless you have family or scholarships footing the bill.  My alma mater estimates the cost of college at $26K per year including living costs, assuming that one is not living rent-free, and that's not even in a $$ city like SF or NYC.

Even though you don't *need* to work right now, I still recommend working part time, as you learn a lot from working and it will be a crazy transition to get a job fulltime after college if you have never had any sort of work at all.  If you make $1000 or more during a calendar year at a part time job, you can invest in an IRA.

When you have maximized your tax advantaged accounts (explained above), that's where things get more complicated.  Investments that do not have special tax savings makes it more difficult to decide.  This is a good resource. Overall, note that this subreddit generally doesn't advocate random stock purchases (aka--""I hear that Amazon is doing really well, should I buy $20K of shares?""

My final thought is that college is a very unique time in your life in that you have 3 months out of every year free to do as you please.  That may never come up again until you retire.  HIghly recommend cheap travel, study abroad, during that time in your life.

"You want yourself in the green before anything. That's a serious amount of debt and a serious chunk of change you've been given. You are incredibly fortunate and have fantastically generous grandparents. 

A possible worst case scenario of investment is you lose the money completely, or the value of the 100k decreases due to poor investment.

Putting a 100k sized hole in your debt will remove the amount of time you will spend repaying it by years. The sooner you are debt free, the more freedom you will have knowing you owe nobody anything. It also reduces the total amount of money you would pay back from the debt. From then on you can earn and keep the money you make. Save it, invest it, spend it. Do what you want with it. 
This is purely based on my experience. Debt is the worst and anything can happen. While I've never heard of a poor doctor, anything can happen and paying your dues comes before any personal expenses.

This choice isn't obvious in most situations, and there are a lot of variables to consider. You should read [the wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional) for this.

&gt; If I contribute to a roth 401k, am i losing out in the long haul because my employer's match is smaller? (since they calculate match % on my after-tax contribution)

No. You don't lose out on any matching funds. For a Roth 401(k), your contribution is still calculated on your gross income. You just have to pay taxes on it. For example, if your gross income is $50,000 and you contribute 5%:

- Traditional 401(k): you will contribute $2500 and you will owe taxes on $47,500.

- Roth 401(k): you will contribute $2500 and you will owe taxes on $50,000.

&gt; If I stay at an employer for around 2 - 3 years, is there any difference between doing trad 401k and then paying taxes to rollover to a Roth IRA versus doing roth 401k?

If you are in the same tax bracket now and when you would make the rollover, then no, there is no difference. It would make the rollover more of a hassle than it needs to be though. If you decided to make traditional contributions to your 401(k), you might as well just roll it over into a traditional IRA. If you plan on rolling over into a Roth IRA in the near future, you might as well just make Roth contributions to begin with.",personalfinance,0

A lot of cards will let you pay mid-statement. Then you can use it again without hurting your utilization ratio.

You can mock up your tax situation for 2016 by filling out a dummy 1040 page 1, using appropriate values for wages line 7, SE profit line 12, and deduction on line 27.

Then take your AGI projection and use it as first line of a worksheet you can find in Form 1040-ES. Or same thing in Pub 505 chapter 2, worksheet 2-1. 

That worksheet will determine minimum required payment. (Your 2015 total tax plays a role.) If W-2 withholding won't fully meet the required amount, you can make an ""estimated tax"" payment by mid-Jan, or just change W-4 at work to have a little extra withheld each paycheck for rest of year. 

Then at tax time you pay whatever else is due. If you overpaid you'd get a refund.

"&gt;am I going to get boned in taxes on my next paycheck or is it going to be fairly reasonable? 

Your taxes won't be affected one bit. You'll have more taxes *withheld*, but as ArtificialNebulae mentions, this is different that the taxes you end up paying in total. You'll end up having the same tax liability regardless of how much was withheld or when. Like if you have a tax liability of $10,000, and had $9,000 withheld, you'll owe $1,000 come April 15th. But if you had $9,500 withheld, you'll owe $500. That sounds like you pay less, but it's just $10,000 either way.

In general, there is some over-withholding in this scenario. Like if you make $2,000 per paycheck for 26 weeks, you'll have less withheld than if you made $1,900 for 51 weeks and then $4,500 for the last week.  Same total payment, but sum of withholding will be a little more (just means you'll owe less or get bigger refund).

&gt; I'm just not sure how this is going to affect my tax bracket

Don't worry about tax brackets. You will never make less money by going up a tax bracket. Say there were two tax brackets: up to $50,000 taxed at 10% and $50,001+ taxed at 20%. If you make $50,000, your taxes are $5,000. If you make $51,000, then your taxes are $5,200, because only $1,000 is taxed at 20%.

&gt;I'm also now salary and will be bumped up with the Overtime Rule in Dec. Will that also mess with my taxes severely?

If you're getting a raise to $47,476 in December, sure you'll pay more in taxes, but you'll make more money (as explained above). For example, Fed taxes on old salary is $4247 and on the new salary is $4352 (making assumptions about deductions). But paying that extra $105 is fine, as you get paid $703 more!

They key is that by not consolidating, you can pay extra on individual loans and reduce your monthly payment as you pay each one off instead of having the same monthly payment over 20 years. 

With one giant loan, your first payment is 1400 and your last payment is 1400.  Paying extra reduces the life of the loan, but not the monthly payment.  With individual loans, your payment could be 700 at year 10 instead.",personalfinance,0

Each one gets a bath once a month. Washing, trimming nails, expressing anal glands, brushing teeth, and a play day is about $60 each. One gets cut every other month and that's an addition $40.

Treats, bones, etc. is probably $20 a month. 

Spay/neuter is a one time expense of $100-$200 depending on where you go.

She has her mind set on buying a basically-new Jeep. I don't know how much she makes, but it is very close to 40k. This Jeep is 2015 and was a loaner car for the dealership, and the purchase price is around $32k. She also proudly told me, she got a $25k loan for a 5.4% interest rate(lol). 

I'm trying to tell her that it is just a car, and one you cannot afford while at that. I know so many people in this subreddit have regrets on spending too much on a car, setting their future goals back.

"&gt; you can definitely find a reliable used car for 10k no matter your area (which you complain about but don't include).

All those car's are going to be out of warranties though, and high miles. I don't care if its a toyota or a honda, past 100k its going to need work, which is where that price ranges puts me. I've dealt with high mile toyotas and hondas, they break, and the older they are, parts are more expensive and harder to find. When my ex's radiator cracked, the only one we could find was $400 through our local toyota dealership, so we had to buy a camry radiator and jimmy the hoses to fit. Plus, my credit union has terms for their loans, and won't loan 10k for a car that is over 7 years old, or has over 100k on the clock. Not only that, many cars around that price range have giant v8's or are sports cars, which are going to kill me with gas and insurance. Or they are luxury brands which are more expensive to repair.

Make a rough budget kind of like you did. Decide upon a number you think is realistic on saving, not so large you might be under water at the end of the month. Then set up an automatic withdraw to a savings account. That was pretty much the only way i knew id save money.

"&gt;""just treat it as a cash side job""

Cash side jobs are taxable income. :-)

If you earn more than $433 in your self-employment, you have a filing requirement. At the very least you'd owe social security and Medicare taxes on your income. Depending on how much you earn, you'd owe income taxes too. 

Put your revenue on Schedule C-EZ and deduct any business expenses. Once you have your profit, feed that into Schedule SE to find the Social Security and Medicare tax.

Then on a Form 1040: Your Schedule C-EZ profit goes on line 12. You can deduct 1/2 SE tax on line 27. You put the SE tax on line 57. Then you complete the rest of the form with numbers appropriate to your situation, such as 6300 deduction and 4050 personal exemption if you are single and not a dependent. Edit: If you also have regular work, then of course your W-2 wages go on 1040 line 7.

The booklet 1040-ES has a worksheet that helps you determine what amount IRS wants you to pay in during each of 4 periods. It depends somewhat on what your previous year's tax was, and it takes into account your W-2 job income and withholding that has happened. You can either send in ""estimated tax"" payments, or make change to your W-2 job's Form W-4 and have a little more withheld from paychecks at job. Form 2210 is used to determine if you owe any underpayment penalty.

"We have cats insured with [Embrace](http://www.embracepetinsurance.com/)  It's an excellent program.  Embrace gives us less problems and faster payment than my medical insurance.  We have a two year old cat that has kidney stones and Embrace has saved us from having to chose how much care she gets.  A year after we brought her home, she had urinary tract infections and kept having issues.  Our vet mentioned an x-ray if the infection came back again, we had done then and there.  Vet came out frowning and sent us to an ultrasound specialist.  She called in a favor and got us in to a cat nephrologist the same day after reading the ultrasound.  With daily drugs, prescription food and distilled water, kitty's doing well and hasn't had that infection come back.  She has kidney stones and as she ages will probably need a stent.  That's quoted as $15,000 and we have the preapproval from Embrace on file.

They allow plans to be tuned.  We have high deductible-high coverage options.  We pay more if there is a problem, and they have a higher annual maximum.  The wellness plan comes out as a savings plan, it pays out about what it costs to pay in over the year.  Dental can be added.  We pay the vet and Embrace usually does direct deposit before the CC bill comes in.

"I think there's a big piece of the puzzle missing here, and that's the people who buy and sell houses purely for the profit, like the ubiquitous ""flipper"" shows. 

Neighborhoods generally have a high end and a low end, and most houses in that neighborhood will comfortably fit inside that range. Maybe the average house in our pretend neighborhood of Shady Acres is $150,000, and has lots of neighbors between $130,000 and $170,000.

You'll occasionally have outliers. If a neighborhood is 50 years old, some of the cheap outlier houses have been repossessed, some of them are run down, and some of them haven't ever been updated. So on your street with $135k, $145k, and $165k, you have two problem houses, one for $105k, and one for $70k. 

There's profit to be had there, because you know that people will pay $150k on average to live in this neighborhood. Let's say the $105k house has no structural problems, it's just that the original owners are selling it with no updates, and nobody wants their 1970's shag carpet and bathrooms with fluorescent red toilets. 

You buy it for $105k, spend $5k on closing costs, and end up spending 2 months putting new flooring in, removing wallpaper and painting in neutral colors, and generally making it look like a modern house. Maybe you remove a few walls to make it an open concept, etc. It appraises for $165k, and you sell it for $160k after your portion of closing costs. If you didn't have anything major go wrong, you just made $35,000 from the sale. 

That's obviously a best-case, and some markets just don't have the houses or neighborhoods to support that business model, but that's how it works. People want to buy move-in ready houses, and they're willing to pay a little extra to get extra features like a fancier bathroom or a bigger common area. 

Most people can do a small-scale version of this when they buy their own home. Every couple of years, you do a small project, like improve a bathroom, or frame a few rooms up in a basement. You generally get a good return on your extra investment when it's time to sell. The big difference is you're exposed to market uncertainty when you're waiting years to sell rather than a few months.",personalfinance,0

I moved out when I was 17, Im 27 now. I joined the military, they taught me a trade, I went to college for free and traveled the world. I would say, your fastest bet to move out is talk to a recruiter. At least that way you can have a stable roof over your head, good food to eat and a very steady check.
