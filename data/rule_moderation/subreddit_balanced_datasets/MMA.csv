"I really want to see Khabib v McGregor, but if we can't get that this is the next best thing. I certainly prefer it to the weird Khabib v Aldo plan. No disrespect to Aldo, but that fight doesn't intrigue me as much as the other two, plus I want to Aldo v Holloway. That's really what I think. 

As to who is right on the contract dispute issue, not really my concern. I am only chiming in because I think some of the posts in these threads are perplexing. I don't really care about buyrates or salaries or any of that shit. 

I love movies, I could give a fuck how much the actors involved make or what ""won"" the box office. I think all those discussions are kind of the least interesting things to talk about in terms of movies. I kind of feel the same way about mma.

But I get that it's all part of it so my two cents: While I generally side with fighters, on this one it seems to me that Ferguson is in the wrong.

I think the major X factor was, until today, the question of when this contract was negotiated. If it was truly very recently, I think it makes sense for the UFC to expect Ferguson to honour it, if it was something entered into in like 2014 and is now verily out of whack with the market, I think it makes sense for Ferguson to get a renegotiation.

The reason I think the contract issue was rendered kind of moot today is because of the news, from the MMA Hour, that Ferguson a few weeks ago was willing to take this fight, at his contract rate, when it looked like the fight would be in January 2017. That didn't happen, then they offered the same fight, against the same opponent, for March 2017, and suddenly, the money isn't fair? For the same thing? Nothing pertinent has changed between 6 weeks ago and now. So essentially, the ask for a renegotiation makes no sense to me now. Cause Ferguson isn't really asking to renegotiate a contract he entered into whenever, in 2016 or 2015 or even 2014. He's asking to renegotiate terms that were sufficient a few weeks ago, during which weeks nothing pertinent has changed. That makes no sense.

It's like when there was a rumour (that ultimately nothing came of) that Nate Diaz wanted more money for McGregor 2 at 202 then he had agreed to when the fight was made for 200. Like, it's the same fight a few weeks later, why are we risking a great fight over this, you already agreed to terms, the fight is just going to be a few weeks later. Did you just change your mind?

Add to that the fact that Ferguson's ask seems to be predicated on Khabib's contract (which is bullshit, your value is your value and your deal is your deal) and it seems to be, based on the incomplete record, that Ferguson is in the wrong here on balance of probabilities.

But, ultimately, I could give a fuck. I generally want fighters to get paid. Plus I stream everything illegally so I probably don't even have standing to complain either way. Plus I think there are more interesting mma discussions to be had. And mostly I want to see some good fights. Let's get on with it.",MMA,1

"When you say casual, I assume you mean that these are the people that will watch the event for the fighter(s) and not necessarily for the sport. Cases in point, Pacquaio vs Mayweather and Conor in the UFC. 

So the only way you can draw the casuals in from that perspective is to market the fighters and not necessarily the sport. 208 has been poorly marketed and the promos don't get anyone invested into the Women's FW title fight. Holly is the girl who KOed Ronda and they haven't talked much about Germaine's achievements being an undefeated kickboxing world champ. 

209 is an even better example. The main event is a rematch between Tyron and Wonderboy and the co-main is an Interim LW title fight between an undefeated Khabib and Tony Ferguson on a 10 fight winning streak. And what do we get as a fight poster for those 2 amazing fight? [We get this sack of shite](http://imgur.com/b3tCI2J)

Look at [Bosslogic's](https://twitter.com/Bosslogic) posters for [Khabib vs El Cucuy](http://imgur.com/7zw1O8O) and [Tyron vs Wonderboy 2.](http://imgur.com/OB6BPOt) 

Now those make me want to watch those fights and I haven't even gone into promotion yet. There's so much that can be done to market these fighters. Wonderboy has a 5th degree black belt in Karate, has an undefeated kickboxing record of 57-0 and has some amazing knockouts in the octagon. Woodley is a 2 time Division 1 All-American wrestler also with some vicious power and some insane KOs in the octagon. Add to that the drama of their first fight, how Wonderboy didn't give up, how Tyron practically gave everything he had and it wasn't enough and that's a must-see fight to the casual. 

For Khabib, not much really needs to be said. The man is a combat sambo world champion and he is a relentless grappler. He cannot be stopped, he will take you down and at this point, it seems like no one can beat him. However, Tony Ferguson might prove to be the one fighter that can figure out the puzzle that is Khabib Nurmagomedov. He has a wrestling background but he's been submitting people left right and centre in the UFC with multiple D'Arce and RNC finishes. He even has an upkick KO on TUF (which could be used as a promo tool as an offence of the ground). 

Another thing to add on with the promos, Joe Rogan has a minimal impact if any impact at all with how he hypes up fighters. It's so cookie cutter that it doesn't have any impact when he does it for big fighters. [Look at how MixedMollyWhoopery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnOVaDaGslQ) hyped up Khabib. This is how you do a promo. Imagine the work he could do if he could use videos as well.

"&gt; Bull shit, Rhonda was a bigger star than Connor(Dana white said this).

1) Dana lies

2) This was true at a point in time

3) None of this matters because we're talking about leverage which revolves around $. Conor brings in more money than anyone in the history of the sport, including Ronda. He has numbers 1, 2, and 4 in the highest PPV spot. Ronda has number 5. and will likely get pushed to number 6 when McGregor is 1, 2, 3 and 5 after MSG.

&gt;Plus they know Connors hype is going to end real soon so they are trying to wave that wave out by having him fight in the higher weight class instead of 145, which he prob won't even be able to make again.

Why is it that almost everyone who shits on McGregor with the most nonsensical arguments spells his name with two 'n's? Lack of attention to detail is probably a common thread. I digress.

This comment from you is just pure speculation and utter nonsense. Let's walk through it. 

The UFC assumes Conor with two ns is going to fail, so they are going to allow him to fight at 155 now. That 145 division is trouble for him with two guys he already beat at the top. So they'll move him up a weightclass (inherently added difficulty) to originally face the murderer of murderers in that division in RDA, in order to what? To kill his hype faster? Your little story you tell yourself doesn't make sense anywhere but in your head.

What does make sense is the UFC wanted a big fight on this MSG card, they never had any other big stars available, but they did have their biggest star available and could make a special champ vs champ fight. It could be for other reasons, but that's by far the frontrunner with the information the public has.

&gt;Diaz isn't even a top 5 guy at LW, maybe just outside it but Connor can't even get past him, lol, so he won't be able to hang w/ the killer sharks in the division.

Diaz is a top 5 LW. Check the rankings. He's beat Cerrone, he's beat Johnson, and he beat McGregor. McGregor also beat him, giving up a slight weight disadvantage.

But you're right LW is a shark tank, and it is beneficial for McGregor to leapfrog that. He's probably like an average of 50% vs the top 5 guys in that division. Flipping a coin that many times is a gamble. 

But you're wrong to assume that he can't hang at the top of that division. And the oddsmakers are not in your favour. You might be right, but if you are it's of the broken clock being right twice a day kind. Not because you are accurately assessing the situation.

&gt;And just wait until Khabib gets him, if the UFC will even match him up w/ Connor.

Wait for what? He might lose, and I'd probably favour Khabib. So what?

Why are you so bent on barely responding to what I wrote and instead going off on a Connor sucks bro! rant? 

You are the source of what's wrong with the world. You emotionally pick a side and then you attack the other side with a shit mist of sentences that is the antithesis of a thought out reasoned response, and serves absolutely no purpose aside from establishing what team you're on and only further raises the fences between the two groups.

You can't compare McGregor to Mayweather even if McGregor was his own promoter. Mayweather made it one event whereas Conor will make it in 3. That means there are at least 3x more cost for Conor and less of a profit in those 3 events. The difference in profit keeping all else equal for an event that does 4 millions buys vs 2 million is not 2x. If you spent $10 million on that event that did 2 million buys and made $20 million the profit is profit is $10 million. If you spent $15 million promoting that event that did $40 million your profit is $25 million. 2 times the revenue but 2.5x the profit. Used hypothetical numbers but the concept should carry. ,MMA,0
"Well they dehydrate themselves and then as soon as they get off the scale they rehydrate.

However now that IVs are banned, I think more guys are realizing that feeling like total shit negates the advantage.

"Its the same way people treated Strikeforce fighters.  Then the UFC absorbed Strikeforce and some of their fighters ended up becoming champions.

A lot of people don't like Bellator because they do have great developing fighters.  But they also have a trend of casting them aside when ever they can pick up a former UFC fighter.  A lot of their own champions were pushed aside to promote any UFC absorbed fighter.  Just look at some of the UFC fighters that were moved to Bellator, a lot of people thought they would dominate because they were ""UFC level fighters"" but the majority of then aren't doing well in Bellator.

A lot of people also don't like Bellator because it shows the harsh reality that the sponsorship environment in MMA isn't as big as people thought it was/would be.  Look at the fighters who left the UFC, even though they have the ""UFC sheen"", a lot of the fighters don't pick up an amazing amount of sponsors, nor make the ""ass load"" of money sponsors are thought to provide.  Last I checked [Benson Henderson didn't pick up that many new sponsors, and from his interview he just matched the amount he received from Reebok.](http://www.mmafighting.com/2016/8/13/12417278/benson-henderson-talks-fighters-association-state-of-sponsorships-in)",MMA,0

"&gt; If y'all think that he wouldn't literally kill McGregor in a proper street fight, check out of here please.

Man Mountain literally has no training in martial arts. McGregor would just pop a jab at him, break his nose, then sprint around to his back, and choke him unconscious.

I know people are impressed with Man Mountain's size, but look at how much skills made a difference in the Fedor, and Hong Man Choi fight (bringing this up because of the size difference). Choi was 350 pounds, and Fedor arm-barred him. And keep in mind Choi is a trained fighter. He's not some meat head.

If Conor had a decent strategy, he could definitely beat Man Mountain. Has the dude even been hit in the face? Or choked? I don't think so. All he can do is swinging his big arms, and squeeze. But he doesn't know how to do submissions.",MMA,0
