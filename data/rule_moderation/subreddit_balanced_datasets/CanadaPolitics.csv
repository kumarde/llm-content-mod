"For those of you who have maxed out your limit of free articles for the month:

New Democrat MP Randall Garrison is putting together a bill aimed at repealing anti-terrorism measures brought in by the Conservative government a year ago. Mr. Garrison says the Liberal government is moving too slowly on its election promise to soften the security legislation, commonly known as Bill C-51, that gave the spooks all kinds of new powers.

Our New Democrats have been considerably muted as a result of the October election. So it’s good to hear them – they should be getting some inspiration from the likes of Bernie Sanders – holding up the values of the left.

Any move by them to salvage civil liberties, however, won’t get far. In due time there will probably be a few amendments to C-51. But they are likely to be minor in nature, like the timid change the Liberals have introduced thus far – the appointment of a parliamentary oversight committee to monitor and scrutinize spy activities. It has the claws of a kitten.

Justin Trudeau did not want to be seen as being soft on terror when the Harper government brought in C-51, which was in response to consecutive terror incidents on domestic soil. The Liberals backed the bill and sought cover with the promise of amendments. But given the climate of the times, given the recent spate of terrorist atrocities, they now feel a new need to be cautious.

What if, an insider explained, the Liberals brought in big-time amendments to defang C-51 and there was a subsequent terrorist act on Canadian soil: “How would we look then?”

There’s another timing problem. The Liberals don’t want to do anything until the U.S. election is over. If Donald Trump becomes president (a doubtful prospect), all hell breaks lose. Security policy, border policy, immigration policy south of the border would be overhauled. Ottawa would have to respond in a manner considerably different than it would if Hillary Clinton wins the Nov. 8 vote.

Politically speaking, the Liberals, because of all the global terror, are under little public pressure to move quickly. When C-51 was first introduced, there was a civil liberties outcry. Rather than just gathering intelligence, C-51 gave our spy agency (the Canadian Security Intelligence Service) powers to make arrests on suspicion that someone might carry out a terrorist act. “Suspicion” is a word of considerable latitude. The spooks were given powers to apprehend anyone engaging in an act that is deemed to promote terrorism. “Promote” is a rather flexible term as well. CSIS was given powers to disrupt gatherings whereas previously it had only a monitoring function.

Reaction on the left was heated: “We’re creating a new parallel police force.” “Anyone can be locked up without judicial recourse.” “Police state here we come.” But you don’t hear much of that any more. For example, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, in conjunction with the Canadian Journalists for Free Expression, is trying to get Canadians to raise their voices through a parliamentary e-petition. They are getting very little response.

The NDP has been steadfast in its opposition to C-51, its point being that you can have tough anti-terrorism laws which do not infringe on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Among the Liberals’ promises of change to C-51 was one that would ensure that CSIS warrants did not contravene the Charter. The Liberals promised a wide range of public consultations on the legislation. But such consultations have yet to begin. The Liberals promised to review petitions by Canadians who find themselves on a no-fly list. But that promise has been diluted.

The parliamentary oversight body is supposed to fill a glaring omission in the Anti-Terrorsim Act (it was inexcusable that the Conservatives were so opposed to oversight). But the committee is severely handcuffed. The government can cite national security to deny it information it is seeking. And the committee doesn’t report to Parliament but to the Prime Minister; he is then free to censor or do with its report as he wishes.

It’s symptomatic of the Liberal approach to C-51, which is to tinker. But on the anti-terrorism law, that may be all that the people want.",CanadaPolitics,1

http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/02/25/whats-really-behind-turkeys-coup-arrests/?utm_content=buffer76309&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer

> **For the last several decades, the Turkish military was untouchable; no one dared to criticize the military or its top generals, lest they risk getting burned.** The Turkish Armed Forces were the ultimate protectors of founding father Kemal Ataturk’s secular legacy, and **no other force in the country could seriously threaten its supremacy. Not anymore.**

On **Feb. 22, 49 officers — including active-duty generals, admirals, and former commanders of the Turkish navy and air force — were arrested on allegations of plotting a coup against the government.** Specifically, the **officers were charged with authoring a 5,000-page memo that was later published in Taraf, a paper whose editorial policy is singularly dedicated to bashing the military.** Among other things, the memo stated that the Turkish military was planning to bomb Istanbul’s historic mosques and shoot down its own planes to justify a coup. When I asked a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey for his views on the news, he thought the scenario was ridiculous. ""If the Turkish military was going to do a coup, they would not be writing a 5,000-page memo about it,"" he stated.

Three **days later, the former commanders of the navy and air force were released — further proof that the government’s intention was to intimidate Turkey’s military, rather than proceed with an indictment against these high-ranking officials.** The arrests followed a Feb. 19 incident in which an audio recording of Turkey’s chief of staff was published in Vakit, a small jihadi Islamist newspaper that has celebrated the killing of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. In Turkey, it is illegal to wiretap individuals without a court order, and it is also illegal to publish such wiretaps. However, no one has been prosecuted for this wiretap against the chief of staff — a sign that the balance of power in Turkey has shifted decisively.

A **mountain has moved in Turkish politics.** All shots against the military are now fair game, including those below the belt. **The force behind this dramatic change is the Fethullah Gülen Movement (FGH), an ultraconservative political faction that backs the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). The FGH was founded in the 1970s by Fethullah Gülen, a charismatic preacher who now lives in the United States but remains popular in Turkey.** It **is a** conservative **movement aiming to reshape secular Turkey in its own image, by securing the supremacy of Gülen’s version of** *religion* **over politics, government, education, media, business, and public and personal life.**

To some, it might appear that the newfound freedom to criticize the military proves that Turkey is becoming a more liberal democracy. But the **truth is that Turkey has replaced one ""untouchable"" organization for another, more dangerous, one. Criticizing the Gülen movement, which controls the national police and its powerful domestic intelligence branch, and which exerts increasing influence in the judiciary, has become as taboo as assailing the military once was. Today, it is those who criticize the Gülen movement who get burned.**",CanadaPolitics,1
"It is disturbing, but not for some pseudo state sponsored propaganda theory that you've implied. 

It's disturbing because it's become cheaper for companies like Rogers and Bell to buy news sources in an attempt to control content and create propaganda. They have no motivation to make news profitable, so they don't and combine news rooms to make journalism more profitable, but really it's a shrinking resources making it harder to find stories that make parent companies look bad. 

It's disturbing because CBC hasn't really created any more jobs, and journalism as a whole has been stagnant (that is to say there are no more journalists now than there were in the 50s) where as the number of people who are working as PR people has tripled the number of journalists and grows year over year. 

If you're worried about propaganda, I'd be far more concerned that the major telecom companies in this country control how you access all your information and entertainment, as well as the content generation of your information and entertainment. 

If you want to know what propaganda looks like today, read a story about the Irvings in NB the local paper (which are all owned by the Irvings). Then compare it to CBC's coverage. Until the tone of the CBC about the gov't is the same as the tone of the local papers in NB the Irvings then any ""Ooooooh, but the government owns,"" fears are unfounded. ",CanadaPolitics,1

I see that Ouellette is learning to operate just like his party. He speaks in committee about how great mincome is and how much it will help his riding, yet votes against it. What is most stomach-turning for me is that he wa's desperate to get his speech on mincome broadcasted, presumably so he could show his constituents how he was fighting for it (I assume he didn't want the vote broadcast). He's misleading his constituents and taking them for a ride.

Medical aids in dying is something that happens on a spectrum. At one end you have ""anyone who wants it can get a doc to help them die"" to ""only if you're suffering in the most horrendous manner, but can't physically off yourself will a doctor be allowed to help you die."" In between, there are lots of different ways to allow for medical aids in dying. Since Parliament changed the criminal code to allow medical aids in dying in certain situations, it has to be tested in the courts if that meets the standards set by the SCC.

With same sex marriage, I don't see the spectrum, I see something more binary. Same sex partners are either allowed the same privileges, benefits and rights that come with marriage (including being able to say that they're married) or they don't. Civil unions have been rejected by the Canadian courts as an acceptable middle ground.

You are forced to learn it, and then you never ever use it for the rest of your life -- the only things you got out of it were soft skills that your course may or may not have taught in an effort to skip past that and propel people to higher grades on the test.

Honestly, as a programmer, what I want all my end users to be taught is ""garbage-in garbage-out"" and ""how to use spreadsheet formulae (and when to get someone to write you an app instead)"" because the former is so very important and fundamental to everything formal language, and the latter is essentially the fundamentals of the first couple things everyone learns about LISP, but unlike LISP is something they are likely to actually have to use.

"Yeah, but even in the general case it's not clear just how likely an action has to be to result in a pregnancy for you to be morally responsible for it. Consider a really horrifying thought experiment, in two different cases:

1. A woman travels to a particularly dangerous area of a country where the risk of her becoming raped is high (higher risk of pregnancy)
2. A woman has consensual sex using birth control (lower risk of pregnancy)

The obvious argument against legalized abortion in the general case (accepting the violin thought experiment as a premise) is that engaging in consensual sex makes you responsible for the results, *because* a pregnancy is a foreseeable outcome. But it also allows for abortion in the case of rape, *because* it's non-consensual.

So, accepting that a) the foreseeable-ness of the pregnancy makes you more morally responsible, and b) abortion in the case of rape is permissible, then abortion in the second case is okay, since it's less foreseeable.

In either case, it doesn't say that responsibility can't be withdrawn arbitrarily. If you're responsible for the violinist's life being in danger (e.g. you drive responsibly, but hit him with your car, leading to his organ failure) and decide to donate an organ, but then change your mind, should you the state force you to go through with the surgery? It's very unclear.

I don't actually know how much I like that argument in the first place, but my larger point is that a middle-ground argument does exist, the article is about people trying to find a middle-ground argument between pro-choice and pro-life, and whenever I see this particular abortion discussion brought up people act like there's no way to reconcile the two situations.

&gt;An aside: age of consent, drinking age (you're from QC which should make this point all the more blatant), driving age, etc.... they are all arbitrary in some way.

Your aside makes no sense to me. In Quebec, you are legally an adult at 18. As such, you can drink, smoke, marry, join the Armed Forces, and gamble at 18. I'll be honest with you -- it is one of the few jurisdictions that actually make sense to me because of the idea that when you're an adult you're capable of making your own decisions. We can drive earlier than 18... I see that as a boon and not incompatible with the idea that adults are free to make their own choices. 


So, in Quebec, the legal age restrictions are not arbitrary; they are related to the legal age of maturity. I feel this way despite the fact that age of maturity is indeed arbitrary.

"Income tax absolutely disincentivized individuals from earning more income. Most people have relatively little control of the hours they work per week, so it's true that income taxes have minimal impact on the intensive margin (how many hours people work) for the median+ worker. But the key impact is on the extensive margin (how many people are in the labour force) - income taxes + welfare benefit clawbacks (which are effectively a tax, because the benefits are a negative tax) have a huge effect on whether people decide to enter the labour market at all. The key issue here is not nominal tax rates, but marginal effective tax rates (METRs). 

What does this mean in layman's terms? A low-income individual with relatively little work skill has the option to:

a) not work at all and live purely off the social safety net (the extensive margin corner solution)

b) work at low wages up to the threshold income where benefits are clawed back (ie. you lose benefits if you earn &gt;$10k/year, so the person works up to $9.5k/year) and stop working at that point (intensive margin)

or c) work at low or minimum wage and attempt to earn enough such that annual income &gt;forgone welfare + opportunity cost of work.

The problem is, C) is very difficult to do for low-skill workers where you have very little bargaining power with the employer to either work more hours or earn higher than minimum wages. So thousands of low-income Canadians choose a) or b) instead. This is the direct causal outcome of income taxes + sharp welfare clawbacks.

"&gt; From your own comment -&gt; If we increase immigration to 407,000 per year GDP growth will increase to 2.5% per year on average from 2050 to 2100 and Canada's population will be 100 million by 2100.

Yes, 2.5% over the baseline assumption 'status quo' 2.0% scenario.

&gt; I have no idea what you are taking about when you arrogantly say I'm making assumptions from the report. You've quoted quite clearly from the report, and the quote is what I am replying to. 

Why rely on my quotes? They don't provide any context from which you are drawing your assumptions. Why not read the report?

&gt;Ignoring the passive-aggressive nonsense you are projecting - I did give support to the argument. It's right there in the comment. 

No, you really haven't. You're just declaring things to be true / ridiculous. That's not support, that's opinion.

&gt;Despite our current immigration levels, we are still going to have an aging population, and a decreasing working-age population. Even If we take 100,000 more immigrants (300,000 current immigrants/year + 100,000 new immigrants/year = 400,000 immigrants per year, like in the report), we will still have an aging population and a decreasing working age population. So yes, we will still become like Japan, even if we follow what this report tells us. This information is readily accessible through Statistics Canada. 

Again, I call on you to *actually read the report*.

You're completely fixated on the 'high immigration' scenario when it's only one of five that are presented. In that scenario the proportion of persons 65 and older peaks at 24.5% of the population in 2060 before stabilizing then declining to 23% of the population by 2100. In the 'status quo' scenario it peaks at 28% in 2060 and stays there.

&gt;Also, we are going to become like Japan (an most other aging, developed nations) because just like Japan, our private debt levels have reached the point where we can't add new private debt. 

Uh, why not, exactly?

&gt;And just like Japan, if we can't add new debt, it's basically impossible to grow the economy. 

That's an absurdity. The economy currently *is* growing, and according to every forecast out there is projected to grow at a faster pace over the short- to medium-term. 

What are you talking about?

&gt;And here is a report that is suggesting we will grow our economy by 2.5% by adding an additional 70,000 working-age immigrants per year, like its a magic pill to solve our growth woes. It's absurd. 

*You can't just declare things absurd* and act like that ends an argument. 

&gt;What, exactly, are you basing your assumptions on? 

Well, currently, the research of the Conference Board of Canada plus Statistics Canada reports showing [stable employment] (http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/lfss01a-eng.htm) as we add immigrants, plus long-term first-generation immigrant employment levels [equaling native-born Canadians] (http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/labor91a-eng.htm).

&gt;Suggesting that adding an additional 100,000 immigrants - many of which are dependents (i.e. exacerbate the cost of an aging population) - will increase our GDP growth rate from where it is now to a sustained 2.5% GDP growth rate for 50 years - is an incredibly strong statement and has no basis in reality. I would like you to support why you think that finding is accurate, rather than parroting its existence. 

It's not a *sustained* growth rate, it's an *average* one. That's a gigantic misconception, and you're going to have to reconcile the difference between them rather than just declare a report *you haven't even read* to be 'absurd' and have 'no basis in reality'.

&gt;This isn't an assumption. It's a fact. The unemployment rate is at 7%. 

More-or-less the [natural rate of unemployment] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/top-business-stories/should-we-lower-what-we-think-is-the-natural-rate-of-unemployment/article14826172/), so no cause for undue alarm.

&gt;Our youth unemployment rate is even higher. 

Yes, that's a problem in parts of the country.

&gt;Our participation rate has been declining and is low.

On the long-term, [not really] (http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2013/08-2/20130907_pop2.png).

&gt;There are millions of qualified young Canadians that are looking for work and cannot get work. 

Except it's at least [partially a false crisis] (http://www.macleans.ca/work/jobs/why-the-youth-unemployment-crisis-isnt-what-it-seems/).

&gt;And in case you needed to have it clarified: adding additional immigrant workers when there is a labour glut - not a shortage - will do jack shit in increasing the tax base necessary to support an aging population, and sure as hell won't grow the economy. If the economy needed additional workers, it could just as easily hire the thousands of qualified Canadians trying to become employed. But they don't. And having additional immigrant workers isn't going to help - it's only going to lower wages than what they would otherwise be. 

This is hopeless.

"The main study cited examined fast food chains, where automation is heavy already (capital intensive). They didn't look at small operations which are still labour intensive, and they might have only a couple of part-timers, if anyone.


The problem with tying wages not to that person's greater productivity/value but instead to their desire for greater consumption should be obvious.

Higher minimum wages do correlate to greater youth unemployment, because if you're the one buying the labour and living with that labour's outcomes it prices the inexperienced/unskilled/unreliable people closer to those with more of a track record, and you need value for your dollar... when people say, ""pfft, just become more efficient!"" this is the main way it is accomplished. It causes the marginally employable to lose their main edge, which is that they are less expensive and therefore the risk to the business in taking a chance on them is mitigated. I suspect it also causes hours worked to be trimmed here and there, but the main problem is pricing those individuals with no experience, a checkered history, a criminal record, limited communication skill, or significant developmental or physical limitations out of the market.


My own view is that minimum wage increases have a suppressive effect on income and employment rather than an outright negative influence: it is true that the sky does not fall when it rises. It is *also* true, though, that you can't raise the price of something without increasing its value and also get more of it.

"&gt;The legality of all these substances is inherently related to their respective health effects. 

I'm going to ask you for a source on that because it's my opinion that health effects are not the primary basis in determining these things. There are loads of more dangerous pharma drugs that are inherently unhealthy than any naturally produced substance. I mean, we don't mind prescribing Adderall to ADD kids despite not fully understanding the effects of the drug on developing minds. We don't really care at all, as a society, on the health effects in this context. 


&gt;When I said, ""Laws, like words, have many shades of meaning, and I get that."" I was attempting to imply that some control is required, but the amount is important to discuss. Their professional opinion of 25 seems appropriate to me.

Wait, so earlier these age requirements were all totally arbitrary but suddenly this one isn't? I don't understand. 25 does not seem appropriate to me. When scientists make evaluations like this they generally err on the side of caution. This is one of those times. 

&gt;My point about QC is that everywhere else (except Alberta) it's 19. 21 in the US.

Cool, but you're the one who keeps bringing up age of alcohol. As i said earlier, for me, that's irrelevant. It's age of maturity that counts for me. And, for what it's worth, I think its ludicrous that people from other jurisdictions can legitimately choose to potentially die for their country before they can even have a cigarette. 

&gt;Clearly, there is a difference of opinions on when people are mature enough to make that decision; there is no ""right"" answer.

There is no difference. The age of 18 is almost universally agreed upon as when people are mature enough to make their own decisions and responsible for those decisions. The other laws are derived from some moral issue. What else can explain it, for, we all seem to agree that an 18 year old is mature enough to be responsible for themselves in almost all other situations. What, besides moral implications, is at play when we talk about drugs and alcohol?

"&gt;That doesn't matter we have to cut our emissions period end of story. You can use all the accounting tricks you want our commitment is a cut in emissions by 2030, this has nothing to do with population, climate change does not care of population it cares of total CO2.

I completely agree that we need to reduce our emissions, but per capita is important to consider. For example, say Ontario lost 500,000 people to BC in a single year, and consequently their emissions dropped and BC's raised -&gt; it would look rather good for Ontario, but the reality is that the population changed, not behavior.

The point of putting a price on carbon is to curb peoples behaviour, so looking at a per capita is a good metric of this. Looking at a total isn't, as there are so many factors at play.

&gt;Yeah this is untrue as well BCs emissions have gone up every year from 2010 onward.

You are right, I was looking at the per capita, not total emissions.

It is important to note that it's increased from 62 to 64 Megatonnes (actually only 1.8 Megatonnes according to that pembina article), which is a rather small jump. Comparatively, Alberta emits 273 Megatonnes and Ontario at 170. So, if we look at absolute numbers, even though BC went up by 1.8, they are still emitting far less than other provinces. 

A per capita metric is the best way of guaging if the carbon tax is changing behaviours.

That said, thank you for the pembina link. I find it hard to believe that BC will see such a large increase by 2030, based on the data at hand. I am curious what sort of forecasting they used for this. They say 
&gt;This increase in emissions is largely due to a projected increase in oil and gas development,
including liquefied natural gas (LNG). Over 80 per cent of the emissions increase between 2014
and 2030 is projected to come from this sector.

What's more likely is that if any quota existed it would be to process a # of investigations, not strip a certain number citizenships. The former would actually be an achievable organization goal, while the latter would vary wildly from month to month based on the cases investigated.

There is a question in section 4 of our survey, ""comments or concerns about online voting?"", which is a short answer section. Considering that you felt there should be a greater emphasis on this, would you have a suggestion for questions we could add?

We are currently considering the user base off of statics on smartphone use in Canada. In 2015 it passed 52% adoption rate by the entire Canadian public. Of that, people between the ages of 18-45, the adoption rate is upwards of 98%. 45-55 sits above 80%, 55-65 is just over 60%, and 65+ is around 24%. We are well aware that our primary demographic will be ultimately be between 18-45, at least to begin with.

As to your concerns about online voting, these are issues we greatly appreciate being voiced, and are at the top of our priority list. Our current concept for security is based around block-chain systems (like bitcoin or this: https://followmyvote.com/online-voting-technology/blockchain-technology/). Which would keep voters anonymous while allowing everyone the capability to count the votes, and insure their ballots were cast as intended.

As for the integrity of ballots cast due to the possibility of authoritative figures (ie, your boss) ensuring you vote a specific way, this is a tricky issue. By extending the voting period, from the regular start of ""early voting"" up until the ballots closes, and allowing for voters to change their vote at any point during that time, users should be able to keep their votes private by casting or altering their vote when they are in private.

"&gt; As I said, I'm not sure what inspiration Fife had when he went after her.  

Maybe the fact that this was more or less an open secret? I would argue it is the responsibility of the press to follow a story. Fife heard the rumour mill, followed the scent, and got a story. Isn't that what we want from the press? That's how major news stories get broken and as a Canadian me and you should be grateful for that. 

In a lot of places around the world a journalist chasing a story or following a legitimate rumour about someone in the govenrment is grounds to be jailed or disappeared, regardless of their skin colour.

&gt; But suggesting that a brown woman in politics might be lying is proof just because there were rumours from her political opponents about it seems idealistic.  

Nobody here is attacking anyone. Fife simply released the facts and corrected lies surrounding Monster's background. 

Thanks to Fife we know know that Monsef was born somewhere other than where she said she was born, and was born a year earlier than her and her identification would suggest. 

Those are facts. Do you believe that the media should not publish facts and expose the lies of those high up in the government? Or should they refrain from publishing facts and exposing lies when the subject is brown like ne?

To be completely honest, it sounds like you're trying to attack the messenger and discredit the story with an attempted to label Fife a racist.

The only person exhibiting racism here is you. It sounds like you believe that brown people like myself are so fragile and sensitive that we need to be handled with kid gloves and not be questioned by the big bad media. It sounds like you think brown people like myself should be treated differently and not questioned simply because of the colour of my skin.

Singapore could cut their emissions per area a hundredfold for a trivial land acquisition. The financial incentives could lead world powers to squabble over otherwise useless chunks of Antarctica.

"&gt; NDP democratic reform critic Nathan Cullen says the party has undertaken an ""unprecedented"" cross-country consultation with more than 37,000 Canadians and has found overwhelming support for a proportional system.

That ""overwhelming support"" comes from a sample that's incredibly biased for two reasons:

(1) The NDP's consultations would've been done by NDP MPs, who only represent ridings that support the NDP's platform, which included adopting MMP, in last year's election

(2) The consultations would've attracted people who are receptive to mailings, calls or social media posts from those NDP MPs - i.e. NDP supporters. People who don't support the NDP are less likely to turn out.

In a sense, this is sort of like when Trump says he has overwhelming support and cites the sidebar questions from Drudge or Breitbart - anyone could've gone and voted in the poll so it's proper consultation, right?

So as a result of these biases (and probably some crafty questions)....

&gt; Cullen says 84 per cent of those consulted want a voting system in which the percentage of seats won by each party reflects its share of the popular vote. As well, he says 82 per cent want to maintain a strong connection with their local member of Parliament.

...everyone at the NDP's consultations supports the NDP's position on electoral reform. Surprise, surprise.

&gt; Among other things, the NDP consultations found almost 80 per cent believe it's vital that parties work together collaboratively. And that includes the outcome of the all-party committee's work, Cullen said, warning that any attempt by the governing Liberals to unilaterally change the voting system would have no legitimacy in the eyes of the public.

"&gt; Actually, Catholic hospitals have a Charter right to refuse assisted dying. Everyone does.

The article explicitly explains why they don't believe that is true in this case:

&gt; Catholic hospitals, which are publicly funded, take the position that as institutions they have religious rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This position was recognized by some Supreme Court judges in a 2015 case known as Loyola High School v Quebec. Three judges concluded that a religious institution, as a collective, could claim a right to freedom of religion under Section 2(a) of the Charter. However, the three judges added a key caveat to this conclusion: “… an organization meets the requirements for s. 2(a) protection if (1) it is constituted primarily for religious purposes, and (2) its operation accords with these religious purposes.” Publicly funded hospitals do not satisfy this test and therefore have no claim to freedom of religion.

&gt;Publicly funded hospitals are not constituted “primarily for religious purposes.” All Ontario hospitals, Catholic and others, exist to deliver medically necessary services, and are funded by the province for that purpose. All hospitals offer the aid and support of religious counsel to families that request it. All hospitals have quiet spaces for reflection and prayer. All hospitals recognize that for some patients, religious counsel, empathy and end-of-life support are vital to a sense of holistic care.

&gt; No publicly funded hospital is organized for the purpose of providing religious care. Therefore, Catholic hospitals do not operate in a way that “accords” with a religious purpose.

Why not argue that none should get it, if there are other programs in place. Keep in mind, many heterosexual couples cannot have children outside of adoption or surrogates either.

"Out here in Saskatchewan, I've certainly seen a number of people talk about their support for the work Creep Catchers does.

But stories like this one serve as a reminder of what consequences their actions can have. A [CBC article](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/creep-catcher-katelynn-mcknight-vigilante-justice-1.3794017) on this subject explores questions worth considering. Creep Catchers seem slow, if not completely unwilling, to admit when they've made a mistake. When someone is wrongfully accused or ""publicly shamed"" by the group, the group makes no effort to then assist in clearing that person's name.

And let's be honest: even if a person is cleared by police, Creep Catchers, and everyone who knows them...That little seed of doubt will always remain and can never be wiped away. This will effectively, 100% destroy someone's life.

It may be fictional, but I'd highly recommend the Danish movie [The Hunt](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2106476/?ref_=nv_sr_2), which should be available on Netflix; as it deals with what happens when a person in a small community is accused of such crimes.

We have due process for a reason; and this incident is a sad reminder of that. ",CanadaPolitics,0

"So, while I actually agree with you implicitly that the 14th amendment should not be repealed, this is pretty clearly a [false dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma).

Your argument seems to insinuate that if this is repealed it will be used for nefarious purposes. (A slippery slope fallacy).

Many countries have repealed birthright citizenship, (India being the biggest), and I'm sure while one can construe that the reasons for doing this is ""nefarious"", I'm fairly confident in stating that the Indian government doesn't see it that way. Especially considering that said legislation was implemented under a left wing government. 

Similarly, I'm sure you don't think that the only reason why one would want to repeal or modify the 2nd amendment is to stop the oppressed masses from rebelling against their oppressive government, correct?",CanadaPolitics,0

"Don't get me wrong, I'd enjoy it from a moral/intellectual standpoint if they simply legislated a ban on carbon emissions, but the actual outcome would simply destroy our way of life.

Using a tax to bend future actions towards a more desirable outcome is more effective than an outright ban, because it allows our lifestyle to continue unfettered, which is necessary to prevent popular revolt. Nobody would actually follow a ban on carbon emissions at this point, indeed it would be practically impossible to do so. Even if they somehow banned the import of oil, we'd be out here burning trees for warmth.",CanadaPolitics,0
"Yeah, well my parents, and my siblings were all 'imported' and I'm unperturbed if not mildly amused by the term.

So I guess my amusement cancels out your offense on the parent front, and i'm just slightly ahead because of the sibling situation?

But wait just a minute here... neither of my parents went to University, and one is retired and the other works a dead end job, so they aren't particularly well endowed in the job creation department.

I guess I'm outraged that you would imply that your parents somehow matter more than mine because they had the opportunity to go to University.

HOW DARE YOU.

"&gt; Definitely on board with the the thought that those trafficking and/or producing should have their convictions upheld as that is where the violence originated from and that is what caused most of the issues in our society.

Yeah isn't the difference between a possession charge and a trafficking charge essentially down to how much you were found with? If it's legalized then wouldn't it also be legal to simply buy in bulk from an authorized dealer? At that point the thing that the traffickers were convicted of is effectively legal, so according do your previous criteria the charge should be vacated. That was the problem I was referring to.",CanadaPolitics,0
