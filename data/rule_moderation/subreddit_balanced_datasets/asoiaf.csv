The Starks go to Bear Island and meet w. Lyanna Mormont. She support them, but have very few men to spare as well.


 Davos comes across Stannis' old camp near Longlake, where Shireen was sacrificed. He finds the wooden stag-figure he made for her / remnants of it or something. He gets very pissed and confronts Melisandre about it. She admits doing it.

Bran has a vision when he gets to the Wall, where he sees the last of the Tower of Joy-scene. We see Ned and Lyanna and we see a baby crying.

 Lyanna whispers to Ned, ""Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you""

Arya will be asked to kill some actress. She refuses and The Waif is given permission to kill Arya. Arya kills the Waif

"> Robert Baratheon was picked specifically by Jon Arryn to become the face of the rebellion

Robert Baratheon was the face of the Rebellion after only the very first battle after he was the first man over the walls at Gulltown and slew the enemy commander in single combat.

>By then we knew that Jon Arryn had taken Gulltown, though. Robert was the first man to gain the wall, and slew Marq Grafton with his own hand. 'This Baratheon is fearless,' I said. 'He fights the way a king should fight.'

Jon Arryn had nothing to do with why Robert was leading the rebellion. His exploits earned him his leadership and support.

>Jon Arryn and Ned Stark did not follow Robert's ""commands"" at any point during the war. It was either split evenly among them in council, or Ned and Robert followed Jon's overall command. Ned and Robert were like 18.

You read a different book than I did considering Ned says that Robert commanded at the Trident

>It was the king's voice that put an end to it … the king's voice and twenty swords. **Jon Arryn had told them that a commander needs a good battlefield voice, and Robert had proved the truth of that on the Trident.** He used that voice now. ""STOP THIS MADNESS,"" he boomed, ""IN THE NAME OF YOUR KING!""

You also read a different book than I did because Jon Arryn's Vale forces were clearly on the left flank at the Trident, and not holding the centre where Robert (and Ned) were.

>On the Trident, when **their father** fell wounded, it was **Lyn** who snatched up Lady Forlorn and slew the man who'd cut him down. Whilst **Lyonel** was carrying the old man back to the maesters in the rear, Lyn led his charge against the Dornishmen threatening **Robert's left**, broke their lines to pieces, and slew Lewyn Martell. 

You also read a different book than I did because Ned says that Robert commanded him to attack the fleeing royalists after the Trident

>""You took a wound from Rhaegar,"" Ned reminded him. **""So when the Targaryen host broke and ran, you gave the pursuit into my hands.** The remnants of Rhaegar's army fled back to King's Landing. We followed. Aerys was in the Red Keep with several thousand loyalists. I expected to find the gates closed to us.""

To be incredibly frank, I find this kind of entitled whinging to be absolutely disgusting. It's entertainment. You have every right to be disappointed it's taking so long, but ripping him personally for not releasing it in the time frame that *you would like* is downright childish. 

I am sick and tired of listening to all the crying about GRRM's slow writing. He's not making, food, water, electricity, or medicine -- it's ENTERTAINMENT. Enjoy it when it comes. I want to see everything finished as much as you do, I'm excited, but I'm not going to personally insult him for being slow or let it negatively impact my life.

When it launches, I'll enjoy it for what it is, and that's what it will be. If he never finishes the series, maybe someone else will pick it up and wrap it up. If they don't, that's OK. Disappointing, but OK. It's just entertainment. Some people act like he's somehow doing something terrible in your life by not providing you the entertainment you want in the time frame you desire.

On my reread of AFFC, when I wasn't racing to find out what happened to all the chars from the end of book 3, I really enjoyed Cersei's chapters and the 2nd half of Brienne's (the first half was still a bit slow for me). I think the 4th book is a pretty good book which is held back by issues with the way that GRRM chose to end the 3rd book with so many major character climaxes and not follow up on them in the 4th. The 5th book is probably the weakest in the series imo, but still was better on the reread as well.

I'm not arguing with the 3rd book being the best (it's very hard to argue with that), but I also think the 4th and 5th get a bad reputation for what is really a pacing issue across the series and not a problem with the individual books themselves.",asoiaf,1

I for myself dont know how to bring the pieces together. He overwhelmed himself with the burden of the story. He should have done a cut a long time ago.

-battle of Winterfell

-let Daeneryss solve Mereen and establish her in Westeros

Something crazy is going to happen in King's Landing before the season is over.  Part of me wonders if once Cersei sets FrankenMountain loose, will she be able to control him?  Could see Qyburn being killed like Frankenstein turning on his creator.  Could also see Cersei doing something very foolish with the Great Sept.  Bran's vision showed wildfire (although that could've been regarding the Mad King or the Blackwater) and Cersei has repeatedly said she'd burn cities to the ground to protect her family.

">GRRM said that people went through with their arranged marriages and that it just never fucking happened that girls abandoned their arranged marriages cause they didn't like the match.

It's pretty funny you would say that, because GRRM wrote two other women who run away from their arranged marriages: Alys Karstark and Shaera Targaryen. There are also an additional three more nobles who broke their marriage arrangements: Jaehaerys Targaryen (Jaehaerys II), Duncan Targaryen and Daeron Targaryen (Son of Aegon V). So, apparently, it happens in GRRM's own universe.

>And it does nothing to change the fact that GRRM said that in real life if someone mouthed off to the pretty prince, a scenario that many think more or less happened if Rhaegar found Lyanna as the KOTLT, that the pretty prince would've raped her 

Except, that is not even remotely true. GRRM talks about how a low born could not possibly dare to oppose a noble. He doesn't say being a spirited person would automatically result in your rape. Lyanna is a high born lady, and the theory isn't that she backtalked to prince and told him to bugger off, the theory is that Rhaegar caught her, which is not something that is an offence against him, and that he helped her hide her identity. There are no peasants mouthing off princes here, there is a prince who finds a lady doing something adventurous but unlady like. Those two situations aren't even remotely close.

No, nor does it need to. The Hound striking a preteen girl in the back of the head with a blunt object with sufficient force to knock her out would almost certainly be fatal in anything outside of a Steven Seagal film. But ""muh grrm loves gritty realism"", right?

>That's all you need to think about before you realize she's not dead.

""Why would the Lannisters execute Ned when they said they wouldn't and it's obviously not in their interests? That's all you need to think about before you realise he's not dead"".

>Of course he's coming back but he actually did die. That doesn't fit the definition of a fake death

Of course it does, as the critical aspect of death is that the person is (and remains) dead. Gandalf ""actually"" died too. Semantics.

"I'll start by saying this is only one man's, skewed and grief tinted, opinion. I, in now way, expect people to agree with or respect my opinion. GRRM is not our bitch. He owes us nothing and if he decides to abandon ASOIAF all together,in favor of yearly releases of Wild Cards, he has a right to. But we, the fans have a recourse. This will never happen. The very idea of it is so Tin Foil it would cause an aluminum supply crisis, but here we go. 

To get the ""message"" across, there will have to be a complete and total fan blackout. No visiting or posting anything on GRRM's live journal and any associated message boards. Unfriending, unsubscribing and unfollowing GRRM on all forms of social media. Assuring that there is 0 fan presence at any and all conventions related to anything GRRM is working on or has him in attendance. No purchases of anything with his name associated with it. Returning every single piece of paper and merchandise associated with GRRM, directly back to his publishers mailing address, from books and DVDs to magazines with an ad on the back page. Freeze him out. 0 sales on the day of TWOW release. No fan reviews, no youtube videos. r/ASOIAF, 0 subscribers. 0 viewers and piraters of the final season of the show.

This is all coming from a deep well of bitterness and disenfranchisement that has been filled to overflowing for some time now, before last years New Year's post debacle and the last two deadlines he blew past. I know it comes across as petty and small. I know it's ridiculous to post this on a subreddit created to discuss his works and talk about how GRRM is the second coming of fantasy authors.

 I get a tingle in my fat pink mast at the thought of GRRM walking into empty convention hall after empty convention hall, with only the press to greet him. The vision of phone calls and e-mails from his publishers, wanting to know why 10's of millions of copies of his work have been shipped to there office from all over the world, gives me more relief than a thousand false promises of TWOW being ready by X date.

The thought of GRRM sitting at a fold out table and knowing that he'll be sitting for hours without a single person coming up for an autograph, brings the same smile that I got reading about the purple wedding.

GRRM receiving an e-mail from his agent, informing him that TWOW sold no physical or digital copies, that TWOW had somehow made negative sales and that booksellers were in fact shipping all his works, Wild Cards and all, back to the publishers due to the sudden and inexplicable abandonment of all his works, by the fans, to whom he owes nothing.

After all those impossibilities, I may just be able to forget my mother weeping at the fact that cancer was going to kill her before she got to know how the series ended, when reading the books to her at her bedside was one of the few things to help her forget her pain. I may be able to forget the snide remarks and eye rolls from GRRM concerning progress on TWOW and all the ""it'll be done when it's done"" ""It'll be done in a few months, no wait LOL no it won't I'm not your bitch.""

GRRM owes us nothing, he'll finish the books when it's ready. But lets not forget, we do not owe him our love. We don't owe him our money. We don't owe him our attention. We don't owe him a pat on the head and a ""of course it's alright to make and break deadline after deadline."" We don't owe him our expectations. We don't owe him our praise. The only thing we owe GRRM, is the same disdain and silence that he's served up to fans that died knowing he doesn't give a damn about finishing what he started.",asoiaf,1

No he means, he left 8 years ago. you're refuting facts with your own dumb assumption.

>Furthermore, to accept his timeline we have to accept that Gerion sailed from Lannisport all the way to Braavos

Funny thing is, the Sailor's wife could have been in Volantis. She's in Braavos later. We have no idea where she was that year.

> If you accept that Tyrion actually does mean that Gerion disappeared 8 years ago and in 291, then you're also stuck with the fact that Tyrion is saying that Gerion left in the end of the year, not the beginning

Where does that say he left at the end of the year? It says when Tyrion was 18. I don't think we have any inference of when he was born. He could've been born early.

"My guesses by season's end:

Ep 9:

Dany and Drogon fight off Masters.  Ironborn arrive and finish them off.

In the north, Davos finds Shireen's grave.  Jon attempts to fight Ramsay 1 on 1 who declines.  Rickon is shot by Ramsay and killed.  Battle ensues.  Smalljon is killed by Tormund in 1 on 1.  Wildlings start to die and get closed in on when the Knights of the Vale arrive and save the day.  They push the Bolton Forces back.  Wun Wun breaks down the doors to Winterfell but is killed by Ramsay with a narrow to the eye.  Jon beats Ramsay almost to death but spares him.

Ep 10:

BwB and Hound capture Brienne and storm the Frey castle, killing them all and capturing Jaime.

Dany speaks with Ironborn about ships and sailing for Westeros.  Idk if it'll just but Yara and Theon or if Euron shows up.  Her arc ends with her setting sail.

Jon and Sansa kill Ramsay by letting his dogs/ghost eat him.  Sansa confronts Littlefinger.  Jon is proclaimed King of the North.

Pycelle and Kevan killed by Qyburn's little birds.

Marg, Loras, Tommen, High Sparrow and several others wait for Cersei to appear at her trial.  She chooses not to and unleashes wildfire killing Loras, Marg, Mace, High Sparrow, countless Tyrell Soldiers and Faith militia and so on.  Mountain and her escape.  Qyburn killed while escaping.  Tommen retreats into the Throne room to escape wildfire and commits suicide by jumping out a window.

Bran sees Tower of Joy Flashback revealing Jon to be Stark and Targaryen.  Benjen tells him to go South of the wall and escape the Others.

Varys arrives in Dorne.  Makes arrangements to gain the Sandsnakes' help and ensure Dany sits on the throne.

Jorah finds Red Preistess who heals him.  He begins his trek back to Westeros after hearing Dany has left.

White Walkers arrive at the wall.  They use Magi to break it down.  Edd and remaining Night's Watch are slaughtered.",asoiaf,1

No, she was an option before she became pregnant. Lady Tanda was committed to trying to marry her daughter to Tyrion from as soon as he arrives in Kings Landing. Tyrion simply looks down on her much the same way the majority of noble ladies look at him. 

&gt; as he's was dwarf, he probably thought that had no problem at all marry a ""homeless peasant"", since his father always thought of him as an abomination. 

No, he clearly knew it was wrong as he kept her a secret and hidden from his father. 

I get that he was young but he knew it was a problem and not allowed.

&gt; EDIT: a thing that occurred to me was the aegon's behaviour when he discovered that his son married jenny. he gave choices to him:

He didn't have much choice. The marriage had already gone public and his son was refusing to back down.

In the grand scheme of things, the world of ASoIaF hasn't taken that long to industrialize if it really has been 8,000 years since the massive world altering apocalypse. 


The two most important things when considering this world is; One, it is very anachronistic. They are applying their standards on the past. That is why there are knights, and stone castles, and steel swords, and things like that when those are really just applying their modern ideas onto the past.

It makes sense to how the white walkers would have been in Essos and Westeros at the same time, however, GRR Martin stated that Essos and Westeros were not connected. Their only connection was the arm of dorne, which was destroyed by the CotF thousands of years ago. 

Also a Valyrian, forgot their name, flew to Sothoryos on their dragon and continued south for apparently 2 - 3 years. So that indicates that they were either going in circles or Sothoryos is massive. Far larger than Essos.  

However, it is a cool looking map, and a highly detailed one at that.

"History is far more amazing than fiction. The Romans claim descent from a bunch of murderers, thieves, kidnappers and rapists (After Romulus murdered his brother, he made Rome a sanctuary city to populate the city). Many of aristocratic roman houses could honestly trace their lineage back over a thousand years. 




British royalty was founded by a bunch of pillaging, thieving, raping,etc. Vikings (the Normans were direct descendant of Viking raiders). British royals can trace themselves back to Rollo the Viking.




And so on. My point, many of these legends have a strong basis in truth. Lann was probably a real con-man. The Starks were probably just one of many kings that eventually defeated defeated all their enemies.





Many of these legends are based on truth and do go back that far.   ",asoiaf,0
Of course it won't. You don't have a giant Wall in a fantasy series if you're not planning on the thing coming down at some stage. It's a Chekhov's gun.

"The show still has a lot of work to do to get to where Jaime and Cersei's relationship is in the books, but they should have enough time to do it.

In the books I'm not sure how it will go down. I'm almost certain Brienne will become the new Hound by defeating Lem Lemoncloak in a trial by combat. But then what next? Stoneheart wouldn't let Jaime go. He'll probably spend the bulk of his chapters (he could have as little as five) in *The Winds of Winter* as a captive, seeing the Second Red Wedding, riding around the Riverlands, seeing Faithbowl at Stoney Sept, and meeting the Ghost of High Heart, similar to Arya in *A Storm of Swords*. I'm convinced he'll escape or be let go by Brynden Tully at Harrenhal and then ride south to King's Landing to deal with Cersei (assuming he isn't turned into a noble figurehead/avatar of Bloodraven to replace Stoneheart).

There has to be a reason for that scene where Tyrion unchained the dragons, and it wasn't so they could burn ships, Drogon could do that on his own.

But I can see Bronn switching sides especially if he thinks Daenerys will win against the Lannisters, he is also aware that Cersei is going bat shit crazy &amp; the fact that Lena wont do any scenes with Jerome Flynn &amp; the fandom loves Bronn....So yep I think Bronn will once again team up with Tyrion....Thank you, hopefully the sun is shining where you are, as it's raining here :)",asoiaf,0

•Army consisting of mercenaries from the continent (Essos)
•Supported by family close to the throne

- Roose Bolton then takes over Harrenhal, giving the impression that Robb's War campaign is starting to really annoy Tywin - not just kick his ass up and down the battlefield.  
  
- I...can't really go on without getting into events beyond your spoiler scope, OP. But my first two points should have cleared up your confusion. Ignore what you've seen in the show, and just go off the books when reading them.

"Thanks for your insight! As a response: 

You're right. It would make no sense for Jaime to kill Walder. Unless we saw in season 6 a slow development of a Lannister-Frey conflict, instead of that pointless siege arc (Blackfish is back!... and he's gone; Jaime feels something for Brienne before she meets him, Jaime feels something for Brienne after she meets him; Edmure was in a cell, Edmure is still in a cell.) And because of this conflict, the Lannister's betrayal can be justified in the eyes of other houses. It could've been spun as a ""had to do it for the good of the realm"" instance. 

I am no writer, so I can't imagine a complex assassination narrative. But I am sure assassinations in plain daylight and in front of a crowd can happen and has happened before, with the killer escaping and leaving the crowd dumbfounded. Especially when it's dark (so no plain daylight element) and you have the power to swap faces. 

If you rewatch that scene, Sansa was maybe 20 meters away from Cersei when Cersei mentions her. She wasn't ""gone"" but rather leaving the feast area at that moment. It was night time, Arya could've shot 3 Faceless Men dart and escaped in the darkness before people realized what happened, or change her face right away. Remember, when sexy Jesus shot his dart in season 2, he was probably in the hallway leading to Tywin's chamber? Yet he still managed to escape even when Tywin called for guards. These things are possible for a skilled assassin. ",asoiaf,0

"The riverlands actually have quite effective natural borders with all of the neighbouring regions. They have the golden tooth with the west, the neck with the north, they can cut off the Vale at the Trident, and cut off the Reach at Blackwater Rush. The Crownlands would have to be stopped at the Gods eye near Harrenhal, which isn't as effective a border, and there is the sea between them and the iron islands, but the iron born are much better seafarers.

The biggest issue is that there are 6 kingdoms bordering you. The only way to stop all of the fighting happening in your kingdom is through alliances, whether that's through marriage or the economy.

Bordering so many countries can be an advantage. If you tax anyone transporting goods through your lands, and ensure the roads are incredibly safe to encourage this, then most trade between the north and the Vale that doesn't go by boat needs to go through the riverlands.

So perhaps encourage the iron born raiders to go after ships to make the seas much less safe, and get paid by traders travelling the safer roads, use that money to hire soldiers, and have an army that anyone will think twice about confronting.

Whilst you could never battle all 6 at once, ensure that your army is stronger than any single kingdom, and ensure that if 2 ally up to attack, you have your own alliance in place to help out.",asoiaf,0

In fact the simple, basket hilt type swords like Needle weigh well under 2 pounds. Two handed swords are uncommon in India but some do exist and these are not too heavy either.

(We have a deep cultural thing about swords.... So I am a bit of a sword/knife geek)

Although some swords do exist which are insanely heavy; there is a sword in Punjab, India that belonged to a warrior known as Baba Deep Singh and it weighs about 32 pounds, and historically was used in battle. (Which he fought at the age of 75 BTW.) You can see that in Amritsar. Of course, these are rare.",asoiaf,0

I agree that the FM= FM was just an cheeky after thought that might have caused the rage


Iron bank is pissed, they are not getting their money back

So 1 FM (high sparrow) is sent to destroy the entire system of feudalism. 

The bravosi don't really need to care about the plight of the westerosi, the faith militant is not important, it is just there to lay the kingdom to ruins. It's a form of weapon specifically to destroy the kingdom

After the feudal system collapse, the royal family gets wiped, westerosi will start to lose faith in feudalism. Then you have wars, hegemony, revolutions, etc,etc until the kingdom is utterly destroyed. A price I think the Iron bank would be satisfied with and they can maintain their dignity.

What then happens will just be the passive transfer of culture from bravos to westeros. Ideas and culture pass along the trading routes. Compared to the rest of essos, I think westeros will be more receptive to bravosi culture ",asoiaf,0

" This is the first book in what we're calling our 'American Triad' (to be followed, in good time, by LOW CHICAGO and TEXAS HOLD'EM


I BET THE 3 BOOKS IN THIS SERIES WILL BE OUT BEFORE TWOW",asoiaf,0
"I think Lanna is Gerion's natural daughter, not Tyrion's daughter.  Gerion was the sailor, not Tyrion. 

I'm guessing the phrase ""where do whores go"" is a misdirection, consistent with Tyrion's consistent identity theme of grappling with the usually negative identity placed on him by others because of his dwarfism -- at times he self-destructively embraces the false identity of imp, at other times he rejects it and shows flashes of greatness.  

Keep in mind, when Tywin ordered the gang rape, he shattered Tyrion's belief that any woman could possibly love him without financial compensation because of Tyrion's dwarfism.  It's why Tyrion has his messed up relationship with sex workers, ranging from irrational love to irrational hatred.

The phrase, where do whores go was spoken by Tywin about Tysha, it's the identity Tywin projects on Tysha.  However, Tyrion should know (as we readers do) that the identity is false -- Tysha was never a whore, simply an unlucky girl who fell in love with a sweet dwarven boy way above her station.  Her being a prostitute was just a lie spoken by Jaime at Tywin's command.  Yet, Tyrion continues to maintain that the only woman that ever truly loved him is a whore when he repeats Tywin's phrase over and over again.  This is because Tywin is now at his darkest and most self-destructive.  He's blind to the revelation -- that Tysha was not and is not a whore.  Tyrion continues to look for his love in the wrong place.  He killed Tywin for the lie and went to war against his family because of it, yet Tyrion still remains trapped by the lie as he wallows in self destructive depression.  That's GRRM style identity irony right there.  

Thus, I think the answer of where Tysha requires us assuming that Tysha never became a sex worker.  So where is she?  Well, we know she's an orphan so she probably doesn't have any family.  We also know that not all of the Lannisters are assholes all of the time.  If anything, sometimes Lannisters can show surprising empathy for the downtrodden -- like Tyrion's uncles to Tyrion, Jaime to Pia,  or Tyrion to Bran.  So my guess is that one of Tywin's siblings, most likely Gerion who was the most rebellious and had a soft spot for Tyrion, saw to the girl's future and the person to ask would be Genna since she seems to have been paying attention to doings of her siblings, nieces, and nephews.  Above all, the Lannisters would have wanted to keep the entire incident quiet and weren't monsters like the Boltons (who would have just killed Tysha), so they would have made arrangements so the victim didn't tell the world about Tywin's cruel crime.  

Finally, there is that mysterious promise of a bride for Raynald Westerling.  Jaime assumes that Tywin had meant Joy Hill -- but that couldn't be the case because Hill was already promised to Walder Frey's son. Also, Jaime is making the assumption based on a clever misunderstanding, with Jaime mishearing ""joy of him"" as Joy Hill:

&gt;""Mention was made of a match for him as well. A bride from Casterly Rock. Your lord father said that Raynald should have joy of him, if all went as we hoped.""

&gt;Even from the grave, Lord Tywin's dead hand moves us all. ""Joy is my late uncle Gerion's natural daughter. A betrothal can be arranged, if that is your wish, but any marriage will need to wait. Joy was nine or ten when last I saw her.""

(Jaime V, aFFC)

 *A Lannister always pays his debts* and Tywin promised a bride from Casterly Rock.  A solution to this riddle would be that Tyrion and Tysha had a daughter and this was the bride promised to Raynald Westerling. 

It's also possible that Joy Hill is Tyrion's daughter.  The timelines match up, although I like this mysterious other bride solution better.

This Checkov's gun is probably going to go off when GRRM needs Tyrion to feel *very* conflicted about going to war with House Lannister.  Sure it's easy to kill the evil family that conspired to gang rape your true love.  It's harder when you learn that some of the family did everything they could after the crime to arrange for your true love's well being and secretly raised your daughter into a member of that same family.  And it's next to unbearable conflict if by killing House Lannister, you may be killing your innocent daughter.   The story of Tysha and Tyrion probably has a third act, and this might be it.  

&gt;""Jaime,"" she said, tugging on his ear, ""sweetling, I have known you since you were a babe at Joanna's breast. You smile like Gerion and fight like Tyg, and there's some of Kevan in you, else you would not wear that cloak . . . but Tyrion is Tywin's son, not you. I said so once to your father's face, and he would not speak to me for half a year. Men are such thundering great fools. Even the sort who come along once in a thousand years.""

"Servants overall were likely the same as all serfs, bound to the land or, specifically, the keep, castle or palace with certain ""rights""  (i.e. the lord shouldn't kill me unless I was tried for a crime or rape my daughter, ideally) and obligations (lord can make me fight his battles, I have to work certain days on the lord's private land, if I find something shiny the lord gets to keep it, etc).  Probably in bigger cities and maybe towns there was more commercial relationships than those in a typical agricultural setting, so there you might see wages and the like.  

Depending on the time period, in Medieval times the line between serf and slave was blurry.  Property (that serfs were tied to) could be sold or transferred, so serfs were essentially sold in bulk since they were tied to the land.  Also, things got even more complicated after the Black Death as serfs sometimes tried to bolt for better deals and so the nobility tried to pass laws limiting serf mobility.  Keep in mind that in these agrarian societies most people are just working as hard as they can to get enough calories to keep themselves and their families alive.

"same, I always think about the other person when reading one of their POV thinking ""I wonder what Jon would say if he seen what Tyrion just went through"" or vise versa. I think the last thought Jon has of Tyrion is when he hears of him killing Twyin? or was it the false blame of Joffery? and Jon thinking to himself something like ""I can't believe he would've done something like that, he named me his friend..."" and felt sorry for him.

"A similar possibility would be a theocracy, either by the High Septon (he is supported by the masses) or someone from the Lord of Light (Jonsus has risen), since religion (of the small folk) plays a significantly more important role in the series than in ""classic"" fantasy. 

I have the feeling that a Litllefinger-dictatorship would still hold onto the feudal structures of the system (lords and feudal control of regions, a real dictatorship might be impropable in the scattered social and political landscape), so in my opinion it would fall into the ""Monarchy/Authocracy"" spectrum of possibilites (prbly. not enlightened/good in this instance).",asoiaf,0

"That's his justification, yes. I don't buy it though.

Taking the untakable castle by military force and cunning *would* be a big symbolic victory (see Aegon/Connington's attempt), but Stannis doesn't do that. The castellan just mysteriously dies. He gains no new followers through it, inspires no one, and it's not like his enemies didn't already fear him (Tywin makes that very clear). No one will fault him for not taking a castle which has never been taken in thousands of years, especially if he ends up getting it anyway should the rest of his campaign be succesful.

"I agree with u/ArranCannon that a Dance plot would simply be too expensive, despite the financial success of the series. While this would be awesome in a perfect world, I don't think it's realistic to expect that. Maybe in a movie (but a movie would be far too short to do the story justice).

I really like your White Book idea though! I think the Kingsguard are really interesting and I love reading about them. It's a very romanticized version of knighthood, and despite the pieces of shit that currently wear the cloak (Meryn fookin' Trant) being boring as all seven hells, the storied knights of past have some good fodder for a show.

However, I've always been a fan of a Dunk and Egg idea for a show. Specifically because it's just a different feel that the main series, and something similar to the current show (like Bobby B's rebellion or the Dance) would come off as trying too hard to replicate the original show. I understand your comparison of D&amp;E to the Hobbit but I don't fully agree with that assessment. I think that D&amp;E can provide scope, history, and background to diehard fans while also being more digestable and easier to understand than the other lore-laden source material. D&amp;E gives HBO the ability to change tone and create a new show experience while also playing in the same successful sandbox as the original show.",asoiaf,0

Dany is just ""If I look back I'm lost,"" and a bagful of throwaway names for hundreds of pages.  Like, seriously, tell me who Jhogo is, and why I give a shit about him.

&gt;Would that Ned had been able to say the same. **Fifteen years past, when they had ridden forth to win a throne**, the Lord of Storm's End had been clean-shaven, clear-eyed, and muscled like a maiden's fantasy. Six and a half feet tall, he towered over lesser men, and when he donned his armor and the great antlered helmet of his House, he became a veritable giant.

* At all costs, DO NOT let Stannis know that Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen are bastards at this point


* Consult with Renly and Loras on the possibility of sending their best spies/assassins to murder Melisandre (A VERY difficult task, yet nothing can proceed until this is done. We'd combine our wealth to hire a Faceless Men if needed!)


* With the combined strength of Stark, Baratheon and Tyrell, announce the truth about Cersei's children and declare war upon the Crown


* Be very careful about the possibilities of wildfire, less it be used to wipe out the entire army in one swift blow


* Focus upon eliminating/kidnapping/persuading Tyrion Lannister, who is the biggest threat in foiling our invasion plans


* Invade King's Landing, have the biggest battle since Robert's Rebellion, eliminate Cersei.


* Gladly withdraw from any politics, leave Renly and Loras to argue among themselves who sits on the throne. Pack up and return to Winterfell


* As a finishing touch, poison Roose Bolton, flay Ramsay. Do not take any chances.


* With Robert indisposed, finally announce the identity of Jon and officially legitimize him


* Live happily ever after

"If they wanted to keep it short they should have narrowed the scope of the story and done that in depth rather than to just breeze through plot points before they're got anyone invested in them.

Did you honestly give a fuck about the death of Doran in S6? Did it have anywhere near the impact as the death of Ned Stark or Robb/Catelyn? If they knew they were only going to have Doran in for a few scenes before cutting him out then they should have just given that screen time to more important parts of the story.

"&gt;Our recorded history is 6000 years long.

Our written history is 6000 years ago. Humans invented language 60k years ago and agricultural societies existed since about 12k years ago. The thing called industrial revolution happened barely 200 years ago and only in one specific region of the world and only after several extremely specific conditions came together. None of these are inevitable or a certainty, it may have simply not happen and they didn't happen in the rest of the world to begin with. 

Civilizations don't just sit down, collect resources and push a button at the right time to ""up grade"". When Europens went to America people there were still using stick-stone weapons and didn't even have proper steel and their civilizations aren't any younger. China invented gunpowder several centuries before it found it's way to Europe and they never though of using it to the extent europeans did. And Europe never invented any gunpowder. The information and the material was carried over from China by the Islamic Empire. And until 17th century, the biggest, strongest and the most powerful cannons and fire arms were not that of Europeans but that of Ottomans.


Asoiaf has no China. The equivalent of China, Yi Ti, is so different from ours that they may never invent gunpowder. There is also no Islamic Empire equivalent in between westeros and Yi Ti, so even if Yi Ti does eventually invent gunpowder, it may never find it's way to westeros. Now ask yourself this, would Eurpoe be able to invent all the tech they did if they never got gunpowder? Because the rest of the world weren't able to invent any of those things.

Pattern welded steel is often wrongly mistaken for Damascus steel because of its similar appearance and is often sold as Damascene steel with the sole purpose of misleading a buyer into paying far more than the blade is worth, thinking it is Damascus steel (where Damascene literally means resembling but not matching Damascus). 

As for dragonbones, I once had a similar theory, but apparently GRRM has been quoted saying that Dragonbones play no role in the creation of Valyrian steel. I'm certain someone who's very caught up in all this could easy quote that source for you, I don't immediately remember where it was said.

He sees his children as extensions of himself, and 'loves' them only insofar as they follow his plan for their life.

On top of that he's deformed and Tywin considers this to be a personal insult and continuous public humiliation. His children are not people, remember, but reflections of himself. 

Tywin's actions in ASOS did not come in a vacuum. Someone had killed his grandson, Joffrey, the king who would finally place a Lannister on the throne. He is furious. And he doesn't have the reader's benefit of a Littlefinger monologue. There is no actual evidence to point to the Tyrells, although obvious motive, and a great deal of evidence to point at Tyrion. *We* know he didn't do it, but to all appearances Tyrion looks very guilty indeed.

Try to win remaining powerful houses of the Reach, even threat Renly to do it for you. With your public claim of King Stannis, he better agree. Besides, you have him in KL. 

* Send a raven to Dorne. ""Join me in taking the Lannisters down, when this is over you can have Tywin and the Mountain.""

* Crush Tywin, if he locks himself in the rock, bomb him out with pyromancer's piss.

* Put Tyrion in front of Casterly Rock if he bends the knee. Lock Tyrek in a room, so you can always know where he is and don't die slowly trying to solve that mystery. 

* Give the golden tooth to the Tullys, negotiate a place in the small council for the Reachers (a Florent preferentially, to keep the Tyrells in check). Make Loras a KG and propose Robb marriage to Marg, that should keep them happy. Propose Stannis to take Renly as his Hand.

* Tax heavily the Ironborn if they do attack. Put Asha in front of the Iron Islands but kill her crazy uncles and father. Marry her to a Mallister but let her children be named Greyjoy. Put a couple of holds and armies in the Iron Islands loyal to Seagard.

* Negotiate with Stannis the release of Jon from his vows and give him a hold in the North. Let him marry, if he wants Ygritte, so be it, his problem.

"First off, terminology: Bloodraven and Bran are greenseers.  Only Bloodraven is the Three Eyed Crow.  I am assuming, by previous 3EC, you mean the greenseer who taught Bloodraven?  

Is there any evidence Bloodraven was apprenticed?  I was under the impression how he became a greenseer was entirely a mystery, but I could definitely have missed something.

Dragons seem pretty heavily linked to magic.   Why would the COTF be interested in diminishing magic when they are heavily involved with magic themselves?  

Now, I think there definitely might be something to Bloodraven helping out the Targs.  You are right in his motivations, at least prior to becoming a greenseer, and you are right that he could have his hands there and a whole lot of other places in the story.  I think Bran grabbing control of the Others is definitely one of the potential end games for the story.  ",asoiaf,0

However, I do think Jon dies and is resurrected. I don't think it will happen exactly like it did in the show, but I think it's important for a few reasons.

They might have been worried about Ned similarly losing his temper, even though we as readers know that Ned was a much calmer man than his brother.

Adding to all this, there's no doubt the Kingsguard knew about the fates of Elia and her children at this point, so they had a good reason for assuming someone on Robert's side wouldn't balk at murdering a child. Even if Ned had been able to convince them he meant Jon no harm, all it would take is one slip-up from one of his men to put the baby's life in danger.
