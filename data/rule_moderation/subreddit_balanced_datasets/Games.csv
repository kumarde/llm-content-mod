"Of course there are people who are concerned. If you think it is all a circlejerk then you should start paying more attention because your inability to realize that there are serious issues doesn't mean they do not exist.

I am not surprised really that most people do not notice them - sometimes even willingly. Most people do not pay attention to history to see the patterns and the previous actions of the involved parties - especially when they are too young to realize that things happened before they were teenagers. And when they do, often it is simpler and easier to just ignore things.

After all for all the issues UWP has, it can be more convenient for some. And the less knowledgeable users wont really notice any difference - facebook works, youtube works, office works, solitaire is there, it has some ads these days but everything has ads, even your mobile phone and Windows looks like a mobilephone now and still everything is fine, the work is done, we can have some fun playing Candy Crush so where is the problem really? Few people notice any problems, fewer care and things continue as normal. Someone has concerns? Eh, they're just mistaken, in my experience everything is fine, they're just misinformed. Bah, whatever, everything is fine, everything works better than before, we have free videos, free music, free programs, free Windows, free mobile phones and some even have free internet. Soon we'll even have free laptops too - they'll be of low quality but who cares. Everything is free these days anyway, everyone loves convenience and free stuff. 

Who cares if this stuff contains GPS trackers, who cares that the OS is sending encrypted information all the time, who cares that programs are locked to the computer they run, who cares that their mobile phones and laptops can be turned on without the users knowing, who cares that their ebook reader can alter the contents of the books they read at any point and even delete books remotely, who cares that the modern trend for applications is to have them hosted in a remote server that give total control to the developer, who cares that all commercial operating systems promote cloud services that store their users' data instead of storing them locally, who cares that as time goes on users have less and less control over their own computers, who cares that more and more hardware comes with software that reports back to their manufacturer, who cares that modern desktop CPUs contain encrypted microcode that can be abused for taking control of the computer, who cares that the companies that give out free stuff have data centers big enough to hold ten times the information possible for every single person on earth, who cares that modern AI algorithms need only a couple of anonymized data points to target an individual, who cares about people whose jobs are to continuously spread misinformation online and make sure that others are not to be taken seriously, who cares about any of the above? I mean, most people dont even know any of the above and of those who do, most don't care and dismiss it as unimportant and unrelated, possibly breaking down each one of them, trying to find flaws, small errors, mistakes and engage in nitpicking in an attempt to ignore the big picture while focusing on insignificant details.

After all that is more convenient and convenience is all that matters. It isn't like we're living in some cyberpunk dystopia after all, the world is still functioning fine. What is the point of caring about any issues that may happen if things work fine now? Let's wait for things to go to hell first and we'll see what we can do then. That is much easier.",Games,1

"> There isn't much headroom.

Got a source for that?

Just because a certain architecture is well understood doesn't mean that *that specific machine* is well understood. PS4 and Xbox One are still pretty different from actual PC hardware (PC's don't have ESRAM or have a unified 8GB of GDDR5 memory for the whole system, for example). By your logic, every game that comes out on PC should be super well optimized right out of the gate, and that simply is not true.

Consoles also have the same hardware (for now) for every single user on a single platform, which has always been their appeal from a developer standpoint. PC's do not have this luxury. It's still possible to optimize for a single hardware spec on consoles, finding specific quirks in the hardware and exploiting them for higher performance, which simply cannot be done on PC due to every single component in a PC being interchangeable. You cannot predict what a user's PC will have. x86 CPUs do not change this.

I enjoyed the leveling experience. Being able to chose from the first four zones as I willed was cool. After I hit the cap I found the end game boring as a casual player. I found the dungeons to be pretty boring, and the mythic dungeons were fairly easy to complete with just world questing gear. I didn't even do heroics, I jumped straight to mythic from normal, no problem. The Emerald Nightmare (normal) was fun enough, but I didn't feel compelled to come back to it.


I also didn't like the final quest zone being gated by reputation. I get the philosophy behind it, it's just not for me. Today I had a lot of free time and the thought of plodding through the same world quests for rep again just sounded unappealing so I figured it's probably time to unsub.

I miss GTA for being GTA and not a god damn business. I did a lot of crates missions on my own, had 1.7 millions worth of crates, then AI attacked my warehouse (didn't even knew it was a thing) and lost $200k when I got there instantly and no one ever left with anything. Some people lost entire warehouses to this. They're not even hiding that they're only there to take money from our real wallets... You spend hours and hours WORKING in a game to earn e-money and they can take it all away because they want to sell shark cards. If I want to grind, I'll start playing WoW.

Paying utilities bills, mechanic, assistant and what not removes $3.5k from my e-pockets every times. Heists are fun once or twice, but repeating them over and over if you don't have reliable friends is just a pain. I've had someone troll and leave at the jump part of pac standard... You can't keep high-end cars that you steal, unlike previous GTAs, you can't even drive or keep some of the exclusive cars that sometimes spawns, like the Dukes.

You say you're not supposed to own all the content in the game, but it's GTA, you should be able to afford everything without the no life part to do so. When I realized that I was working in a game just to do anything, I just lost hope with GTA. Last time I've checked, they've made 250 millions with shark cards and that was a long time ago, so the hopes of getting the good ol' GTA back is slim to none.

I found it utterly bizarre how the Call of Duty series insisted on using silent protagonists for so many games.

I actually really like BF4's campaign, but ""RECKER, RECKER, YOU'RE IN CHARGE, RECKER, SO OPEN THAT DOOR, RECKER, AND DANCE, RECKER, DANCE! RECKER, RECKER, RECKER!""

You can hire a decent voice actor and make him/her say a few dozen lines lines like ""go there"" and ""good to have you back"" and ""I'm proud to call you my brother. Now let's do that manly videogame hand-grabbing thing where we establish that we'd follow each other to the depths of hell, and this scene will foreshadow how you're going to sacrifice yourself to save me from the hamster assassins sent by the Italian government to destroy any trace of their involvement in 9/11."" and BAM, you've got instant player narrative engagement in the story.

Just as is the case for other MMO's and games of this nature: existing players and veterans are hungry for the new content, so they blast through it quickly. This isn't necessarily bad and I'm not judging anyone for doing so, the issue is that the game becomes stale very quick and it becomes-as people have mentioned-a grindfest. 

The difference for someone like you and me is that we're going through and experiencing all of that content prior to this expansion (at least I am) and taking our time through it.

Like gun balance. If one gun is straight up better than anything else, players will use that, it doesn't matter if other options are more interesting if they take 2x-3x as much time to kill same enemy.

"**Persona 5** 

*(No specific story spoilers, but I do talk about some gameplay stuff)* 

Holy shit this game is good. 5 dungeons down, nearing 70 hours of playtime, and I've loved almost every second of it. Literally everything is an improvement over the previous games, be it a minor quality of life change or a major overhaul.

The dungeons are probably the biggest improvement since they basically scrapped everything about them before now and started afresh, and they're amazing. Seriously amazing. With the exception of the side dungeon ""Mementos"", none of the dungeons are randomly generated. They've put an absolute truckload of effort into them this time around, filling them with gimmicks and puzzles to keep them interesting outide of battles and constantly switching up the visuals (which look brilliant by the way), compared with P3/4 having one corridor design repeat itself for the whole dungeon. Sneaking up on enemies is now done through hiding behind cover until the enemy is close and then attacking them, it's much less tedious than before, and while the cover system took me a bit of getting used to, when I get the swing of things it became really damn fun to use. Each dungeon has a villain this time around, and even though most of them don't get a tonne of screen-time, they've done a really nice job at providing a lot of character development for them through the appearance of the dungeon, since each ""Palace"" represents that villain's perception of the world.
 
Combat's roughly the same as before, but it's so damn fast. Animations have been sped up drastically, and the menus are far faster to navigate due to the changes in layout. It's really great that not only are the UIs stylish, but they're also really efficient. There are a bunch of new additions to combat though, some are given to you right away, others are unlocked though cooperations (the new name for community/social links), for example the ability to switch out party members mid-battle, and the ability to have everyone gain EXP from battles, even when they're not in the party. Finally I have reason to switch between every party member freely, rather than just picking a few and staying with them the whole game. Playing on Normal, the game hasn't been too difficult thus far, with the random exception of the second boss, which has a huge spike in difficulty, that then goes back down for the succeeding bosses. A couple of the bosses have felt a little unsatisfying due to simply being too easy or short, but the cutscenes that follow them have made up for that by being immensely satisfying.

Music is by far Meguro's best work yet. The scoring during cutscenes is really well done, the regular battle theme is amazing, the dungeon music is absolutely rocking, the boss themes are great, it's all so damn good. There are much less songs with vocals in them, which may be unfortunate news for some, but for me it's great. Meguro's not great at writing lyrics, especially not in English, so I'm fine with more instrumental stuff. There is however one song I don't like, and it's the music that plays during the side dungeon Mementos. It's a 10-15 second long loop, and it is excruciatingly difficult to listen to, it's the only song in the game I don't like, which is why the fact that it plays through the entire dungeon is so infuriating. 

Since it's a Persona game, the cast are great. The characters are by far better than the P3/4 casts, none of the cast feel anywhere near as obnoxious as I felt some of the previous games' characters did. The voice acting is partly responsible for this too, it's some of the best I've heard in a game, which is why it devastates me that Atlus USA are continuing their backwards practice of removing the Japanese dub for the English release, since the performances here are genuinely outstanding. Characters like Futaba worry me, since if they don't get her absolutely perfect in the English dub, she'll be ruined completely, and they got her perfect in the Japanese dub. That said, one thing that bugs me is that the game is not fully voice acted, once again only the main story scenes are voiced, and a lot of the day-to-day stuff is not. In a game where the voice acting is this good, that's a real shame. 

Story-wise, it's my favorite yet. Atlus have really matured since P4 -- heck, since Catherine. They deal with some really heavy stuff right off the bat, and handle it really tastefully. It feels like they've found the perfect tone for Persona, more serious than P4, but far from the edgy/depressing level that P3 was, though I'm sure some people will disagree. The way the story is told is a huge improvement, the 3D models look far more expressive than in the past, and the animations are great too. During everyday events they can convey a lot more, and there are far more set-pieces for cooperations to take place at too. There are also 3D cutscenes for some important story scenes, and the direction in these is fantastic, and P3/4 could never have even dreamed of something like these. The anime cutscenes are more frequent than previous games, and they're beautiful too.

"Nice video. I think it misses the root cause though, which isn't actually a gaming specific one, it's a business methodology one. These days products are designed according to a checklist of buzzwords, one which is generated using competing products and ""market trends"". Nobody ever stops to ask ""why?"" during this ""design"" process. It's just a naive process of ""me too"" so they aren't he one left out. 

His comments on overpowering players were a bit hit and miss though I thought. While I agree with what he was saying personally, I don't think most of the gaming audience does. Most people are terrible at video games and they don't want a challenge, making characters stupidly powerful is the answer to that. I don't find it very engaging, ""sleepwalking"" through games as he puts it, but most people WANT that for some reason.

EDIT: It's also pretty easy to see why this has happened to the game industry. It went from tiny industry of enthusiasts that the mainstream viewed as a hobby for nerds and losers with no friends to a multimedia Juggernaut eclipsing hollywood in the space of like 10 years (around 1995-2005). It never got a chance to ""grow up"" and work it's self out. It had to steal from hollywood to put up it's ""AAA"" facade and to be honest, pretty much nobody has even begun to do the experimenting and exploring required to drive the medium forward as it's own unique thing.",Games,0

""I have to rant how good the new Hitman is, because I don't think it's getting the praise it deserves""

Reading reviews, looking at something for what it is rather than what you think it *might* be? Is that really such a novel fucking concept?

If you like Hitman, there is absolutely no argument as to whether you should buy the game or not assuming you can afford it. The reviews are great. You're not ""risking"" any money since you can buy exactly the levels you want which have reviews. They're priced appropriately, you only save $5 by buying the whole game instead of per level.

"&gt; Im refering more so to the choices YT has made that has ruined it for a lot of people.

Twitch is 100% as bad. No, they're not. They are worse.  
A lot of the bad decision Youtube have made are an extension of the legal settlement with Viacom that they have to follow. It all more or less springs from there and a lot of it is to avoid losing in court again over dated copyright law. If Youtube/Alphabet can't win that fight, Twitch/Amazon can't either.    
Twitch's bad decisions are mostly due to Twitch's self-defined community guidelines that are enforced more based on whether you are part of the old guard or not than whether the rules are followed. Not to mention that punishments on Twitch goes directly to increasing length of bans from the entire platform which spells death for the kind of content creators you mentioned.   

&gt; but ultimately twitch/amazon gives more of a damn about its users than youtube ever has.

Point was just cause they have some multiplayer bits he doesn't want people think of it as a multiplayer game. That would line up to the EXACT same language in the tweet as he as used in other interviews. 

Somehow you think one tweet the week of the game release nullifies every interview prior to that. Point was his verbage was used when ensuring people you COULD see other players.

It would only make sense if there was a forced release date that HG felt they had to cut back on things to meet that date.

I'm not saying this is what happened, but the people blaming Sony are more or less doing it with that thought process.

For 5-man mythic+ content I play disc. For raid content I play Holy (unless its 10-12 players, in which case I tend to stay disc just because my current gear is better for disc, and weapons a few levels higher), and Shadow for when my other friend who plays Resto druid is on and wants to do mythic+.

Sure I won't be able to play one to the highest extent, but it's whatever. I play them all well so a few artifact levels behind isn't going to make or break me as a player.

Now I'm just working on SHadow's second (also at 22) and Holy's second (25, currently 17).

As far as my monk alt, I just play him when I can and make sure to have artifact knowledge ticking so I can at least power catch up (for the most part) eventually. It's a lot of playing, but it is what it is.

"&gt; While you are a 100% correct, it's still pretty surprising to see Cisco involved. They are notorious for creating their own proprietary stuff and begrudgingly implementing standards.

Yeah, that one threw me for a loop as well.

I remember a couple years ago, Cisco was gave out a perpetual [license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenH264) for people to use their implementation of the H.264 encoder for free, and a lot of people (myself included) thought it was them trying to keep people off of VP8 until their HEVC implementation was ready by dropping the price of H.264.

Turns out it was actually them trying to keep people off of HEVC until Thor (which later became AV1) was ready.

&gt;Add that plus their target demographic compared to the rest of those companies and it's a real head scratcher what their end game is.

Cisco is huge in the video conferencing game, but they don't really care what codec they use. They just want it to perform well (and not cost them a fortune).

If it has to be something that Cisco won't make money from, then they'd prefer it to be royalty free.",Games,0

The Crew has a fantastic world to cruise around in but the driving mechanics are nowhere near as good as Forza and the general game structure is grindy and not as fun. The care are also far less detailed.,Games,0
