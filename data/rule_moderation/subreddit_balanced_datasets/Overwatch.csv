"There's the smug troll we know and love! I had a feeling you'd go back to the tried and true method. No hard feelings. I understand that simple logic is pretty hard to refute and I appreciate that instead of just vanishing in embarrassment you've chosen to continue to keep me company <3

[Aww yiss](http://i.imgur.com/BD5dOac.png), this is my favorite part. The part where you read plain and simple logic, have absolutely nothing reasonable to say back, so your only recourse is to pretend you were too good to read it. That alone would be satisfying enough but then you also pretend your inability to format a comment is on purpose. [Oh you](http://i.imgur.com/w3qdG9G.png), I know you're just doing that to make me feel good ;) But wait, there's more! In the same point you attempt to refute something I said in my comment and simultaneously claim to not have read it. [It's like silly internet fight Christmas!](http://i.imgur.com/QFiFFem.png) You went to so much trouble to get me something and I didn't get you anything. What can I get you on such short notice? The only thing I really know about you is that you're insecure; perhaps [a motivational pillow](https://www.amazon.com/Inspirational-Motivational-Quotes-Throw-Pillow/dp/B01GJNTJGW/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1483172196&sr=8-7&keywords=motivational+pillows)? Then you can wake up inspired every day! I know it doesn't really compare to everything you got me, but I have to get you something or I'll just feel terrible.

"I am ready for the hate I ~~might~~ will receive from writing this comment. I always tell people to kill themselves, it's just a thing I say. I don't think of it as an issue but others have and tell me ""Don't tell people to kill themselves, what if they actually do it?"". And to that my reply is always the same, ""if some random person on the internet tells you to kill yourself and you do it, then you're stupid and there probably wasn't much of a future for you anyway.""

"I love the game Overwatch, but i am a console player at heart. For one im looking for people who want to play on ps4. Consoles need love to.
Im also looking for some help on my channel on YouTube if you are interested in watching competitive matches on console. The series im working on is called Grandmaster Quest. Like the name suggest its a series where i play competitve mode in each season trying to reach the goal of Grandmaster, difficult, i know. That won't stop me its about the journey aswell but im always looking for people to play with while i record. Its a newer channel so im not up there yet but im hoping i can turn it inyo something.

"But you would like them more.  The default assumption for each character is heterosexual (whether you or I like it or not unfortunately).  By taking that away your taking away the similarity between the two characters.

And yeah you are selfish.  And no you're not a bitch, you're a prick.  A fucking idiotic one at that.",Overwatch,1

"The best part of this whole thread is you keep calling me ""him"" and ""he"" when I am a trans female. Thank you for assuming that much about me since I go against the narrative that has been painted for you.

My response was hyperbole to your exclamation that ""people can be fired for being gay"" when in fact, that is false. Us LGBT folk have more protections under the law than a ""straight white male"" has. What actually happens is people CLAIM to be fired for being gay, and when the employers have released the facts for their dismissal AFTER they received copious amounts of HATRED from people like you, it is proven that they were BAD AT THEIR JOB.

My most played characters are Zarya/Lucio/Mercy/Roadhog/Symmetya typically whenever I play with a group. However, I can and do play Tracer/Torb/whoever needed to fill the comp whenever I play alone.

I tend to fall into a shotcalling role whenever it's needed, especially whenever I support. So if that is something that your group needs I would be more than happy to oblige.

"**TL;DR:**  Type in ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ for proper formatting

Actual reply:

For the 

    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

like you were trying for you need three backslashes, so it should look like this when you type it out

    ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

which will turn out like this

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

The reason for this is that the underscore character (this one \_ ) is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does (this guy \* ).  Since the ""face"" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the ""face"" (this guy (ツ) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first ""\\_"" is just saying ""hey, I don't want to italicize (ツ)"" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol

***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***

Edit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \_italicize\_ or \*italicize\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\_italicize\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\\\_/¯ but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.",Overwatch,1

"You're saying that like there's people with torches & pitchforks outside in Irvine, picketing the place until these demands are met to shoehorn they're creative vision. How can that possibly be in this case?!

Tracer's a been mostly established character. She's been there, this whole time. There's ship-people & everything but no one's actively demanding anything. No ones unfurling banners at them telling them, ""hey hey! make tracer gay!"" Suddenly, they release a comic that's completely tertiary to the game itself for the holidays. In it, it reveals this character, oh yeah, she has a girlfriend. That's all. And through all of that? You're still here going ""Well jeez, I hope they weren't forced!!"" That's the disconnect here. Nothing seems  remotely forced. At all. It's their creative vision, & ultimately their call. You second guessing that is precisely the sort of thing you're angsting over here. That's why I don't get your concern. It seems completely contradictory.

Also, Marvel's been a pretty shit company anyway, so don't hold them as a metric. Once Star Wars ramps up, Disney will lop them off like a vestigial limb.",Overwatch,1

"60 Hz/FPS is quite smooth. Sure, 120 and 144 are smoother, but it's only less than 60 where it becomes truly noticeable. Okay, perhaps if I played at 120 all the time and went back to 60 I'd notice it, but it's not the same as 30 vs 60 for example.

I get about 120-130 FPS usually (VSync disabled) and so there's never any sub-60 stutter.

"I'm 2811 SR right now. I don't really play much rank but when I do I find that the diamonds I verse aren't any better then me. I got up to rank 60 S1 so I'm probably close to a Diamond player. I would enjoy ranked so much if I got put in games with all diamonds. Instead I am stuck with the 2700 Genji that brings his 2500 Hanzo friend with him. 

I just don't think the current ELO system takes into account SR potential enough. Someone that has 1000 games at 2500 is viewed by the system the same as someone that placed 2500. If the person placed in 2500 climbs to 3000+ then every game that person played to get there wasn't really that fair because his skill was undervalued. System doesn't match climbing SR players with climbing SR players and the games at high platinum turn into ""Which team has more potential"". If I get matched with someone that is a hard 2700 with 1000 games played the chances that they will help me make it to Diamond are very slim, sure it's just one game but the whole system works like this and most likely you'll get another in the next game.

It's why bringing in a team with people you know can perform at higher then their current SR is so much better then Solo que.

Anyways I would enjoy being the weakest link on a team. Toss me in games with Diamonds and let me win a couple to slowly climb to Diamond. I'm tired of getting tossed into middle platinum games and hoping my team contains more future Diamond players theirs.",Overwatch,0

"Yeah, Torb's gun is insane. It's got a little projectile gravity to it which makes it kinda tricky. But I've shot Pharah's out of the sky with just his gun. It's more tough for people to focus on the turret if they are being shot at by Torb at the same time.",Overwatch,0
"I kind of like the spirit of this idea, but like others are saying it would make queue times really long. Maybe if instead it just displays it beneath your name? That way during hero selection everyone knows what you're most likely to pick, so that they don't have to wait for others to pick to make sure they pick a hero with good synergy. However, I'm not sure how useful what I just described would actually be.",Overwatch,0

This game sux. It's a rip off of Team Fortress 2 which also sux ass. Call of Duty is way better and is the best fps of all time!,Overwatch,0
Changing 10-20 graphics options every single time I go back to the menu isn't the practical solution. its just a suggestion it wouldn't compromise the game in any way. ,Overwatch,0

"It's a vicious circle. the other people don't talk because no one else does. I've gotten good results when i actually started to talk, don't only say hi.

"The solution is play with premades.  If you play with randoms, it's a crapshoot and there's no reason to complain because you know exactly what's going on.  No matter how much people whine about it, it's only their fault for choosing to continue with the failing system.",Overwatch,0
"There was a high fps settings.ini file around since the open beta but most of the stuff it did was introduced as an in-game option at some point, the only stuff that didn't get in was the option to disable ""baked shadows"" which are casted by structures and the geometry of a map, which means they are not done in real time and barely touch framerate, however, disabling them pretty much deleted all light in the map making it much easier to spot enemies hiding in dark corners.


AFAIK this option was completely removed from the game after blizz found out and updated the game, so even if you find the config it may or may not work.



The best thing you can do to improve your framerate is to set render scale to 50%",Overwatch,0

there is no ""basic comp"" outside of what ingame hints say, and composition suggested by those hints is 1attack-1def-1tank-1healer-1sniper-1any. People aren't obligated to follow, give a flying fuck about, or even know pro level meta, therefore assuming that people will know and follow it is a mistake on your end.",Overwatch,0
Ahh. Idk in Chicago it's basically the way you present yourself more than the color of your skin. As a white guy if I wear my jeans around around my knees and yell at people across the street or driving by in cars I'm just asking for the cops to stop me. I had lots of hipster black friends and lots of hood black friends back in high school and their experiences with law enforcement greatly differed. People would also treat them differently mostly because one style makes you feel comfortable and the other style is associated with violence/gangs.,Overwatch,0

"which is still dumb, as ""just pressing Q"" does not get you the results from this play. He's ignoring the other skills that went into it, such as the teamwork with Mercy and the very specific timing with the team leaving the spawn room.

Lol or you just shake with your left because who cares? Its not called a right-handshake. Any hand will do. ,Overwatch,0
"This is a good topic. Her heal is somewhat obnoxious, people usually don't have the feeling that it's Ana that it's healing them. I remember a game when I had gold medal in healing but people thought that it was Lucio that was healing them, even though Lucio was using speed boost 80% of the time.  
It would be nice if Blizzard changed that in a way to make it clearer that Ana is healing you.  
Another thing that makes people yell at Ana is the fact that she is the newest character, and people tends to blame things that are not super standard. People blame Mei too sometimes, even though Mei is a pretty good pick right now in this meta.  
And yeah, I'm not the best, but I think 3150-3190 is not really bad, so...",Overwatch,0
