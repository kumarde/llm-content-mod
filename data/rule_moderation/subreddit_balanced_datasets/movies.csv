"Here's a list of movies and their years. Rating out of 5 is my own opinion of the films with respect to how worth your time they are.

* Planet of the Apes (1968) 5/5
* Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) 2/5
* Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) 4/5
* Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) 3/5
* Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973) 2/5
* Planet of the Apes TV Series (1974) ?/5
* Planet of the Apes (2001 - Tim Burton Remake) 1/5
* Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) 5/5
* Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) 5/5
* War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) ?/5

[Timeline visualized](http://i.imgur.com/fR8jW9W.png)

Only the last 3 are directly connected, with small homages to the original 5. *Rise* and *Dawn* loosely follow the structure of *Conquest* and *Battle*. Looks like *War* could probably also be along the lines of *Battle*

Because as long as that white man isn't harming them physically or impeding ay of their freedoms then live and let live.  Dude is a just a racist.  Deal with it.  I'm not gonna.  But if I don't I get hated on.

 I am happy the people who are my same skin aren't blowing shit up though and cutting up children and raping them though in the public eyes, so I don't have to deal with me not stopping them from doing what they are doing.  Maybe if muslims that span the entire globe go and IS  the judgement and hate for them will go away.  Until they are responsible for ISIS then they run the possibility of being stereo typed because as my white guy example, if your skin color does something and you don't physically stop or intervene then you are one of them.

I know you can do better /u/Death_proofer, I've seen it in you before and I spoke with your Mommy at the beginning of the year.  

She told me how you try so hard to spell things right, that you even sing your ""ABC's"" every night while Daddy rubs cream and his special medicine all over your Heinie and your ""Special Purpose"".  Would you like to sing the ABC's to help you remember to always check your spelling?  I will sing with you if your heart desires.  I know you want me to rub your special cream and Pa Pa's special medicine all over you but that is Dada's job, and he told me a secret in a telegram in which he trusted me to tell you when the time was right, and I believe that time is now.

Daddy-O's favorite part of the day is when he comes home after a long day of working at the chocolate factory, and Mommy has warmed up a big bowl of cream for him, he goes to his special hiding place to extract the concentrated medicine, he slowly begins  to lather up his big, crusty, strong, man hands, and he begins to slowly caress and rub the thick yellowish white cream and oily medicine all over /u/Death_proofer.  Your sweet baritone voice soothes his soul as you sing your ABC's to him; his hairy lips begin to moisten and quiver, he has reached Nirvana.

"My opinion of *Ghostbusters* 2016 is same as my opinions of the *Robocop* and *Total Recall* remakes / reboots: they're bland films that don't come anywhere close to matching the classics upon which they were based.  

The thing that surprises me is how boring all these remakes are.  I did not expect them to be masterpieces like the originals; I would have been fine if any at least made me feel as though the $10-15 I spent on a ticket was justified.  But they were all boring; to me, that's the worst thing a movie can be, especially when it's got a production budget of $100+ million.

Another thing I find interesting is that with the *Robocop* and *Total Recall* remakes, there was nothing remotely similar to the shit storm that *Ghostbusters* elicited.  Like GB, the other two were remakes of beloved sci-fi classics.  Yet unlike GB, relatively few people complained, and most people simply chose to ignore it.  The newer *Robocop* and *Total Recall* came and went with barely a whimper, yet *Ghostbusters* has an army of trolls going after it.

It actually really made sense for his motivations and transformed the character for pretty underdeveloped to genuinely well done; all of the hints he drops in the movie about pulling away from the rest  of the world because of his duty as a Guardian, the tale he tells Garona about giving up his love, and such and such.

But people have an emotional connection to him that they don't have to a stranger.

The 30% sounds excessive, but it is an *or* not an *and* (it's called $20 million against 30%, I believe). Basically, if the movie isn't successful enough to hit a gross profit of $67 million (meaning at least roughly $190 million in gross revenue, and that's if they spent $0 on advertising), they don't owe her anything. If it does better than that, then she starts getting paid. 

That may still seem excessive, but it does seem like a safer investment to me, because it's only if the movie truly is a significant success that that 30% even matters. ",movies,0

I don't think it was impossible to follow, but there are a lot of things I thought during my viewing of it ""they didn't introduce that person very well"".  
  
Also, they don't explain many things well. WHY won't the high elves help the humans? They are busy fighting off the zandalari trolls! That's important! But the film made it seem like they were just like ""your problem, not ours"".  Who was talking to medihv and corrupting him? Well, it wasn't guldan, it was sargaras... But how would anyone know that? They didn't even mention sargaras, who is who guldan is working for.
  
They didn't really explain a lot of smaller things either. Those blue guys in the opening who guldan used to open a portal? They are very important to Warcraft, but it was used more like an easter egg than anything.  
  
Lastly, the film was the plot of the first Warcraft game. That game ends with stormwind falling. That's a PRETTY big change, and the film want really very long so they could have included it.

When my mom didn't have a babysitter during the day shifts she worked (she usually worked nights when my older brother would be home), and usually the days were uneventful. I'd sit with this one friendly elderly woman who taught me how to knit, and periodically Mom would take me on her rounds to go visit other residents. There was one old lady in one of the far off wings who would scream like that, and me being a seven year old was kind of terrified of it. I asked mom why the lady was screaming, and she would say, ""she is very sick."" It's for people like that I hope all states agree to allow assisted suicide; who would want to live like that or see their family member live like that? 

---

My maternal grandmother had dementia. Everyone else on her side on the family died between 65 and 80 I think. She lived until she was almost 92, but she began showing signs of dementia within a few years of 9/11 (seeing the attacks on the news sent her into a frenzy since her son - my uncle - worked in the area nearby the towers. He was unharmed, but communication was cut off for a whole day and he was unable to return home until the next day because he took public transit to work).

When her memory seemed to really go downhill, and she had a couple falls, my mom, aunts and uncle decided that instead of putting her in a nursing home, they'd move her to the state where my family lived. Mom was an RN, my stepdad was retired and usually home. I was in high school. They move my grandmother into the house two weeks after my sixteenth birthday. 

I'm really happy I had that time with her, but it wasn't an easy year either (she passed away while she was with us). She would wake up confused in the middle of the night not knowing where she was. Her mind kept regressing back to when she was seventeen (the age she was when her youngest brother died of illness). She kept mistaking me for her school teacher. I sat up with her at 1:30am once retelling her who she was, who she was married to and how many children she had... she didn't remember any of it. At the end, she sadly mustered a smile, squeezed my shoulders and said, ""Well, thank you young girl for trying to help me."" She still didn't know who I was. I tucked her back into bed and sat with her until she seemed to be asleep. We had some good times when she was herself, and then there were nights like this.

We eventually had to check her into a nursing home because her condition deteriorate to the point beyond my mother's care. She visited her mom every day, and I went with her once to see my grandmother. She was there for a short time it seemed... maybe a couple of weeks? She became so thin because she wouldn't eat. 

I'm scared of watching my mother go through similar; I'm her youngest child, and she doesn't trust my older siblings to respect her wishes for elder care. I think she expects that I will take her into my home like she did with my grandmother; I'm not that capable as she was with her nursing. 

I'm worried for her. I'm scared for myself and that my mind will eventually turn on me. I'm not sure I fear death, but I fear losing control of my body and mind while I still have it. ",movies,0
"True, but that death was also built on the tension of the rest of the sequence (from the trailer going over, to the ropes failing, and finally the attempted towing).

Everyone I knew had seen Inception and spoke about how deep it all was so by the time I saw it, I was kind of let down (still loved it like, but expectations =/= reality). No one had seen Shutter Island, or cared enough to discuss it, so I went in completely blank slate except for what I'd seen advertised and...I loved it. So much. 

Shutter Island was something else. Totally different to Inception, so I'm not sure how you can compare them, but if you asked which I'd rather watch I'd take SI every single day.

"&gt;mullholland dr, i got news for you, is not some obscure art house film.   
  
...it is art house lmao. art house doesn't mean how much it has been exposed to audiences. Tree of Life grossed 50 million and it's still arthouse.
  
&gt;i bet not one of them has a large exposure, aka arthouse films  
  
lmfao Agnes Varda is a famous filmmaker. That being said I don't see how ""larger exposure"" somehow make a filmmaker better.",movies,0

"&gt;the greatest directors have always borrowed from the preceding generations, thats how art works  
  
There's a difference between being influenced by other people and then just aping other people's styles.  
  
&gt;and i do love mulholland dr.... im not sure what are you arguing even with me at this point.  
    
&gt;and whatever movie you like you will be forgotten, if not already nobody gives two shits about it now.
