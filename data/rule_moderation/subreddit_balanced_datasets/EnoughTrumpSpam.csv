I'm not a minority but between Islamic terrorism and anti-White hate crimes I feel unsafe as well.

Reading your post it is clear the intellectual dishonesty is in full effect.  Your argument boils down to ""others are bad too"".  Make no mistake, all religions are bad, but Islam is the worst amoungst bad things.

Compare the key figures in Christianity and Islam.  Since they share the same overall ""god"", old testament bullshit is null. However Jesus was a peaceful man who preached love (for the most part).  Muhammad the Liar on the other hand was a violent warlord who used his claims of a divine mandate to conquer the lower half of the Arabian peninsula.

Thus, is should be abundantly clear:

Christians who are violent are so in SPITE of their faith.  
Muslims who are peaceful are so in SPITE of their faith.

Your clever usage of misleading polls is also quite sad.  Take a moment to educate yourself about what the majority of Muslims actually think about terror.

The difference between an antifascist and a Nazi is the difference between a man defending his family and the pack of thieves from which he defends them.

This is the first sentence of the Wikipedia article on Social Darwinism: ""Social Darwinism is a name given to various phenomena emerging in the second half of the 19th century, trying to apply biological concepts of natural selection and survival of the fittest in human society"". 

The article draws a direct line between eugenics and this concept multiple times, here, for example: ""By the 1920s, social Darwinism found expression in the promotion of eugenics by the Chinese sociologist Pan Guangdan. When Chiang Kai-shek started the New Life movement in 1934"".

"No, I literally just googled ""Who does the Bill of Right apply to?"" and read the very first link.

&nbsp;

Your first link is weird, it seems to make the argument that every bill must specifically state that it applies only to citizens when the prefix to the right does specifically state that it applies to only citizens. Hmmm. They're not very smart.

&nbsp;

The second article sites the 14th amendment which reads ""nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" 

&nbsp;

But that doesn't mean that the rest of the Amendments apply to them, that also relies on the fact that they've been arrested within the United States, not excluded from entering.

&nbsp;

The second link then goes on to saying that non-US citizens have the same rights as US citizens, but only when it ACTS on them Abroad. Denying entry is not acting upon you, it would be you acting upon the US government. (Attempting to immigrate.)

&nbsp;

Salon? Skipped.

"he absence of a response to the Trump U story left the candidate to fill the vacuum with a torrent of demagoguery against the federal judge overseeing the case, Gonzalo Curiel, who Trump said was biased by his “Mexican heritage” despite his Indiana birthplace.
Trump’s comments against the judge horrified many supporters, but the real estate mogul rebuffed efforts by campaign staff, donors and party officials to back off the incendiary claim this weekend, per sources, telling them he was unwilling to look like he had caved to pressure.

“These are things that will defeat [us],” a second source within the campaign lamented.

The Curiel story made Trump’s already difficult task of lining up surrogates even harder, as supporters like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell distanced themselves from Trump’s remarks over the weekend.

The dollar is the reserve currency and vehicle currency of the war.  Each dollar is based on oil.  The reason that it is this way is because all of us in the united States express ourselves exactly how we feel.  All speech should always be free as long as rational thought is free to combat it.  If you don't like what we say don't listen.  We have to have rpolitcs and thedonald in today's world to work out what is right.  If you were around during the creation of the country you may have thumbed your nose at the Federalist papers arguing for a republic because you felt a direct democracy was the proper system.  You may have grown tired of and not even read the Federalist papers after the tenth or eleventh one.  The point is we need to argue.  This is why we have the power that we have.,EnoughTrumpSpam,1

"&gt;How do you think Hitler got voted in? 

Everyone who downvoted me and thinks Hitler was voted into power, please, raise your hand. Go ahead, I can't see you. Raise your hand.

Hand raised? Good.

Let me tell you something.

**HITLER WAS NOT VOTED INTO POWER.** He always received a minority of votes in fair elections. He had previously been arrested for treason for attempting a coup d'etat with only a few thousand followers. Hitler never had even half the democratic popularity Trump has. The socialists and communists were **far** more popular. Hitler was not the Trump of the elections he was in. He was the Jill Stein. Hitler seized power via underhanded means once his party got a few seats in government for receiving a small minority of votes. He tricked Hindenburg into giving him emergency powers (yes, just like in Star Wars) which he then abused to obtain absolute control. Remember hearing about the whole ""night of the long knives""? Yea that was because everyone fucking hated Hitler so he killed some of them to instill fear in the rest.

I don't remember Donald Trump ever attempting a coup and going to jail for treason, writing a manifesto about his ethnic superiority, or threatening to take over Canada because Americans deserve more land, or commiting genocide in Vietnam or Afghanistan as revenge for America's losses there.

So, all of you can go ahead and downvote me and go on thinking Donald Trump is the next Pol Pot (maybe I'm being too optimistic with assuming you all know who that is), but frankly I think a lot of you need to *go brush up on your history* before you go around thinking donald the fucking joke trump is anything like motherfucking hitler or mao. jesus christ.

&gt; People cant judge evil peoples atrocities until they give them power to show them

Hitler wrote a book 6 years before even gaining a minority of votes where he talks about aryans being the master race that needs to enslave all other races and kill all the jews. Donald saying blacks kill blacks and lets bring back stop n frisk and lets deport muslims is bad, yes, but on the same level as Hitler?

"One of my favourite things about the NYT article is how it addressed this exact point in advance:

&gt; In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Mitnick said he could not divulge details of Mr. Trump’s finances without Mr. Trump’s consent. But he did talk about Mr. Trump’s approaches to taxes, and he contrasted Fred Trump’s attention to detail with what he described as Mr. Trump’s brash and undisciplined style. He recalled, for example, that when Donald and Ivana Trump came in each year to sign their tax forms, it was almost always Ivana who asked more questions.

&gt; But if Mr. Trump lacked a sophisticated understanding of the tax code, and if he rarely showed any interest in the details behind various tax strategies, Mr. Mitnick said he clearly grasped the critical role taxes would play in helping him build wealth. “He knew we could use the tax code to protect him,” Mr. Mitnick said.

In reality, Brexit will, at best, probably do jack shit for these people. We’ll still be under a Conservative government and austerity will continue. The only difference is that we will have ostracized most of our key allies on the world stage, thrown the country into social turmoil and taken away the government's obligation to follow any European regulations. This is the government which is literally, as we speak, attempting to “redefine” the Human Rights act after all- something that will be all too easy without the EU watching us.

But none of that matters. Because anything will do at this point, and you can bet the alt-right is all too happy to fill that void.

"- The complaints from ""Katie Johnson""/""Jane Doe"" are being filed in California. Paris Hilton lives in California.

- Paris Hilton was 13 years old during the summer of 1994, same as ""Katie Johnson""/""Jane Doe"".

- Paris Hilton did some amateur modeling work for charity shows as a child when living in California, and when she was 15 years old her family moved to New York City. ""Katie Johnson""/""Jane Doe"" alleges in the affidavit that she took a bus ride to NYC for that Epstein Party, and that she was initially invited there with promises of gaining connections into the modeling industry.

- At age 19, Paris Hilton entered into a contract for work with..... Trump Model Management.

- The other alleged victim, ""Maria Doe"", was 12 years old during the summer of 1994. Wasn't Ivanka Trump also 12 years old then?

- Donald Trump has ""known"" Paris Hilton since she was 12, presumably just a year before this (and is otherwise friends with the Hilton family), and has said, ummm, [quite a lot of creepy shit about his lust for her and his lust for Ivanka](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/02/donald-trump-s-douchebaggiest-interview-ever-any-girl-you-have-i-can-take-from-you.html).

&gt;“Now, somebody who a lot of people don’t give credit to but is in actuality very beautiful is Paris Hilton,” Trump told Stern. “I’ve known Paris Hilton from the time she’s 12, her parents are friends of mine, and the first time I saw her she walked into the room and I said, ‘Who the hell is that?’ **At 12, I wasn’t interested… but she was beautiful.**” *(Maybe he was interested at 13???)* He also admitted to watching Paris Hilton’s sex tape with Knauss, despite knowing her since the age of 12 and being very close friends with the Hilton Family.
But he saved his strangest comments for Ivanka, who was 21 at the time. “You know who’s one of the great beauties of the world—according to everybody—and I helped create her? Ivanka. My daughter, Ivanka. She’s 6 feet tall, she’s got the best body. She made a lot of money as a model—a tremendous amount,” he said. “She’s considered one of the most beautiful women. And she really is, she’s a great beauty.”

- At age 17, Ivanka forced Donald to [promise not to date any women younger than her](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-ivanka-trump-dating-promise_us_57ee98cbe4b024a52d2ead02). Why so young for that???

"[Ezra Klein makes a really good point about this:](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/2/13137604/trump-tax-return)

&gt; All the Times has is three pages of Trump’s records from 1995. Everything else is informed speculation, extrapolation, and the word “could,” which appears again and again through the article.

&gt; Think about how dangerous that was for the paper. Trump could have released his tax returns and proven them wrong. Trump could have shown their speculation to be mere speculation, and used it as a cudgel to discredit their reporting on his campaign. The Times was far, far out on a limb.

&gt; But the Times bet correctly. Trump still isn’t releasing his returns. And here’s what that means: whatever is in his returns is worse than what the New York Times is telling the world is in his returns. The Trump campaign has decided it prefers the picture the Times is painting — a picture where Trump didn’t pay taxes for 18 years — to the picture Trump’s real records would paint. 

NY Times is basically daring him to release his tax returns and he still won't do it. It's the one time he doesn't take the bait.

He's got some serious skeletons in his closet if he won't do the obvious thing that would shut all this down.",EnoughTrumpSpam,0
"&gt; The first time she had seen [Trump], at a rally in June, she was just beginning to realize how many people saw the world the way she did, that she was one among millions. At the time, her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her. She had gotten them in February, during a difficult time in her life, when she had been involuntarily hospitalized for several weeks after what she called a “rant,” a series of online postings that included one saying that Obama should be hanged and the White House fumigated and burned to the ground. On her discharge papers, in a box labeled “medical problem,” a doctor had typed “homicidal ideation.”

...

&gt; “It never crossed my mind that I’m losing it,” she said several months after her release, and a big reason for this conviction was the rise of Donald Trump, who had talked about so many of the things she had come to believe — from Obama being a founder of the terrorist group ISIS, to Hillary Clinton being a co-founder, to the idea that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia may have been murdered in a White House plot involving a prostitute and a pillow.

&gt; “They say they found a pillow on his face, which is a pretty unusual place to find a pillow,” Trump had told the talk-radio host Michael Savage, who was using his show to explain the scenario to his 5 million weekly listeners, who then spread it on Facebook, where it wound up in Melanie’s feed.

...

&gt; To Melanie, this was the glory of the 2016 presidential election. The truth about so many things was finally being accepted, from the highest levels of the Republican Party on down to the grass roots of America, where so many people like her didn’t care what some fact-checker said, much less that one day Trump would suggest that Obama wasn’t born in America, and on another say maybe he was.

...

&gt; Through the windshield was a part of Pennsylvania that is more than 90 percent white, ranks among the worst in the state on indicators such as unemployment and premature death, and is near the top in support for Donald Trump, who got two-thirds of the GOP primary vote in April.

&gt; “My crappy little corrupt community,” was how Melanie described it, speeding past houses with roofs sagging, porches tilting and buildings rotting into overgrown grass. She slowed as she entered the tiny downtown of Brownsville, population 2,292 and shrinking.

... 

&gt; 
&gt; She lit a cigarette and squinted at the screen.

&gt; “Look at this,” she said, pointing to a photo of Michelle Obama with a caption suggesting she is a man. “It’s everywhere.”

&gt; And then she began explaining, step by step, how she had come to believe that the first lady might actually be a man named Michael.

&gt; She figured it started with the Christian televangelists she had followed since the 1980s. In particular, she loved John Hagee, who had said that the Antichrist would appear as a “blasphemer and a homosexual.” And Jerry Falwell, who had blamed the Sept. 11 attacks on “the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians.”

&gt; “Also,” Melanie said, “Falwell disclosed that the first Christmas Bill and Hillary spent in the White House, Hillary collected ornaments from homosexuals all over the world. And those ornaments were hung in the White House foyer.”

...

&gt; “Here we go,” she said now, finding it on her phone.

&gt; She read the headline out loud: “Joan Rivers died two months after calling Obama gay and Michelle a transvestite.”

...

&gt; “He really does love us,” Melanie said, and soon, the balloons were dropping, Trump was waving to the crowd, and she was switching off the television. She didn’t need to hear any more.

&gt;The first Times-Picayune/Lucid Poll, released Wednesday (Sept. 28), provides a snapshot of the presidential race in the wake of Monday night's debate between candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

and

&gt;The Times-Picayune/Lucid presidential poll is a non-probability survey based on more than 400 likely voters responding online each day. More than 30,000 people have been in the survey pool since Aug. 1, and daily results are based on a rolling, three-day weighted average of responses, avoiding daily ""noise"" or temporary anomalies.

Non-probability polls are used mainly by market researchers (read: what Lucid does) to generalize a sample of the population with opt-in sampling, as opposed to 538-style of aggregation and probability.

What is actually pathetic is your total lack of historical perspective on the subject. Just because something is referenced in pop-culture does not make that something inherently innocent. You have to be incredibly dull to ignore the subtext of classism and ableism present in the practice of awarding someone the ""Darwin Award"".",EnoughTrumpSpam,0
"He claims that everything with his name on it is the best ever. I doubt he's been to every casino on Earth, or sampled every steak. I really doubt he went to an unaccredited ""university"" to get hustled. I even doubt he's read more than a dozen books in his lifetime, and he claims his are the best.",EnoughTrumpSpam,0
"I had a hypothesis about this phenomenon that I posted about in another sub:

&gt;A significant number of people saw Bernie as a blank screen on which to project their own opinions and ideals, regardless of whether he shared them or not. Of course this idea of Bernie as an empty vessel was helped by the fact that before his presidential run he was a nobody who had done nothing of note, and his stock speech was big on vague promises and light on hard ideological lines in the sand. It was the political equivalent of pareidolia; people heard whatever messages they wanted to hear in the signalless noise. When he actually grew a pair and made his stances known it pissed a lot of people off that the flesh-and-blood Bernie Sanders disagreed with the Bernie Sanders they had constructed in their minds. That's why we see a lot of people still calling themselves Bernie or Busters while they disavow and work against everything he stands for. It was never about Bernie as he exists in reality, it's always been about the Bernies they imagined him to be and which he let them believe in until it was too late.",EnoughTrumpSpam,0
"&gt;The first time she had seen [Trump], at a rally in June, she was just beginning to realize how many people saw the world the way she did, that she was one among millions. At the time, her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her. She had gotten them in February, during a difficult time in her life, when she had been involuntarily hospitalized for several weeks after what she called a “rant,” a series of online postings that included one saying that Obama should be hanged and the White House fumigated and burned to the ground. On her discharge papers, in a box labeled “medical problem,” a doctor had typed “homicidal ideation.”

&gt;Melanie thought the whole thing was outrageous. She wasn’t a person with homicidal ideation. She was anxious, sure. Enraged, definitely. But certainly not homicidal, and certainly not in need of a hospital stay.

&gt;“It never crossed my mind that I’m losing it,” she said several months after her release, and a big reason for this conviction was the rise of Donald Trump, who had talked about so many of the things she had come to believe — from Obama being a founder of the terrorist group ISIS, to Hillary Clinton being a co-founder, to the idea that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia may have been murdered in a White House plot involving a prostitute and a pillow.",EnoughTrumpSpam,0
