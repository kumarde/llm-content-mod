"Hey man, I totally know what you mean. I feel college is a waste of time and capital in my opinion. I've literally learnt more by buying courses online and self learning stuff from books than sitting in a 1 and a half hour lecture. The education system is really screwed up because the majority of the countries in the world get you to study for tests to get in to universities to study the course you want to study, yet YOU DONT EVEN KNOW if the course you want to study is going to be the right fit for you. I'm pretty sure you know this but it's not you that is feeling the same thing but A WHOLE LOT of other people feel enraged as well, some become depressed - personally I feel I've been cheated of my money.

I can't give you any advice.. but I actually made a video similar to this awhile ago about depression and loneliness so I hope this helps you:

You can start one.  This is hard when depressed, but possible!

You only need two members for a meeting.  But three is ideal.

Maybe you know some fellow depression sufferers.

Maybe some doctors or therapists or psych wards in your state could pass your contact information (or [social card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_card)) on to their patients.  To make it easy, you could give them a stack of social cards.

Maybe you could post flyers in grocery stores and such.

"Speaking as someone who survived a car wreck yesterday that my friend did not, you don't want to. You really don't want to. You don't want to do that to your family. So many tears have been shed on my behalf, just because I'm alive right now. I've been reading my friend's facebook page since the crash. Every single eulogy by friends describing his wonderful life. I ended his life. All my fault. I know it was an accident but it hurts to think what I did to his family. I couldn't imagine doing it to mine now. And I have dreamed of suicide. For a long time, I've wished I could stop feeling. Just feel nothing and let the world slip me by. I wished I could just die and nobody remember me. Let me tell you that they WILL remember you. It hurts to think about. I'm wasn't scared of death then and I'm not now, even after I survived what my friend did not. But I cannot change the past. You cannot change your past, only your future. Do not throw away that future and destroy the hearts of your loved ones. I've seen so many people shattered these last 36 hours and it was all an accident. I couldn't imagine a suicide. Do not do that to anyone. Find help. Get help. Life is worth living. Even if I don't believe that right now myself. Do not do that to your family and your friends.

"Nahhh man you've got it locked. Nobody has best years, as such - the best years are the ones you make the best. Your best years could be just around the corner if you make the change.

I don't even want to be on that phony motivational stuff, cus I find that's like crack for positive vibes. But I'll say imagine all those things you want to do - lose weight, have friends, do shit. You can still do that. You could, in two years, be at a comfortable weight, have friends - people who are out there right now, sleeping or eating or driving, who you'd be super compatible with. There's a gym, trainers, roads, just waiting for you to exercise on.

I mean hell, you won't know until you try. In five years you could be at a friends barbecue - in five years you could be lonely, but at least at a healthy weight, and happy with yourself - in five years you could be in the same position you're in now. Which would you prefer? When you're 35, or hell even 40, d'you want to look back and think ""why didn't I make a change?"" Or d'you wanna think ""why didn't I do this earlier?"" I mean the answer should be the latter.

Maybe I'm misguided but I feel that you'll make it either way. I mean the first step to solving any problem is identifying it. You *know* where you want to be, what you want to do - so eventually you'll force yourself to change. I guess this is kinda rambly but I just wanna say that you can do it. If you set your mind to it. And if you fail - hell, at least you tried. I don't know you, but I believe in you.

I mean as far as friends go, you have to - or should - love yourself. You can't blame yourself for ""wasting"" those years - you didn't know any better. Nobody ""wants"" to waste their years - you didn't do it on purpose. Feel for yourself and try and forget about why the past 10 years sucked - think about how you can make the next 10 years better. It'll probably be slow changes- progress is rarely instant, whether its a month or a week or a year. A good change is a good change.

You almost sound ready but I'm not sure.,depression,1
"My advice is, don't compare yourself. And I understand why people might disagree, and here's why.   
All throughout your academic career, you've probably always been compared to others. In fact, thats the entire reason why there are grades, so you can compare. At an early age, humans are taught that the best gets everything, and if you can't be better than the best, then you will live a really boring mediocre life. That's why A students always get honor roll while other students sit and watch, its to make everyone WISH they could be the best.    
That's a bad way to approach life, because comparison, means that you actually care about other people's success. Now here's the thing. You, are you. It sounds really self explanatory, but this is exactly why other people's success should not define you, because you are not your friends, and your friends are not you.    
My suggestions; delete or deactivate social media. Facebook, Twitter, whatever, its the perfect platform for people to air their ""great"" lives, but remember that every story has two sides. No one wants to be judged negatively, those same people with ""great"" lives, probably have bad moments, but you don't see those bad moments because no one likes to show bad moments.    
Second: go for a jog. Nothing much, 1km. Say hi to everyone you meet. If they dont' say hi back, whatever, keep running. Do this for one week. If you are comfortable with 1km after one week, great! Now do 2km each day for a week.    
The goal is to make yourself feel happy about they way you are, by setting personal goals. Your goals, your happiness, is not defined by others, so theres no reason to compare yourself to others, unless you are hypercompetitive.    
When people say ""just stay positive"" they usually mean that you have to actively try and think positive thoughts if you want to get out of depression. Its a good advice worded terribly, because it sounds like generic advice. A better way to phrase it would be ""smile everyday, listen to funny songs about ducks, watch cat videos, read corny jokes, go for a jog, play some games, read comic books like Asterix and Obelix, and laugh."" I can guarantee that at least one of those will brighten your day, and you do this everyday, eventually you'll see that life has its bright sides too.",depression,1
Do you really not care? If you did not care than you would not be depressed. Instead you would be indifferent. You can only feel bad if you care about something. ,depression,1
Dumb shit,depression,1
"I used to be ""sad."" Cried all the time, etc. Now I just feel dead. I don't cry, I don't feel much. I'm just empty. And it's not just toward me. I often don't feel much towards others. Being honest, a lot of my family members (like grand parents and such, not parents or sibling) have died recently. Each time my first thought was ""shit how do I make it look like I am sad."" If something great happens to someone, I just think whatever but say ""cool"" and such and try to show something. Or I just get envious.

And as a side thing that I'm not sure is really relevant; I dont get affected by ""fucked up"" videos. A week or two ago I watched a video of a 12 year boy get his limbs cut off and then fucked by his attacker. Didn't phase me. I've seen other stuff that just doesn't affect me, the list could go on.

"No. you should tell them you're good or great. because nobody likes being around a pessimistic dull boring person, and if they sense you're like that then you'll still be alone and depressed.

 Honestly this place is *mostly* full of pussies. I have had really bad depression for over 5 years now starting in my early-mid teens, but I learned to embrace it and use it as fuel/motivation to be and do better. Fuck all the meds and BS, go to the gym and lift weights, or take up boxing classes and hit a punching bag to unleash your emotions instead of drinking or smoking some bad substances that will harm you.

If you think you're burning out mentally or 'tired', take a day off and go visit your local hospital and see a 13 y.o. cancer patient who probably doesn't have much longer to live and won't see his best years, then come back and say 'you're tired'.

I love the feeling because it keeps me motivated and not become complacent, you're not gonna have ups all the time in your life so learn to embrace the hardships because it makes you a stronger person. I know people who would get depressed if they heard their favourite celebrity broke up with their SO, meanwhile for me I wouldn't even care if you told me I had 48 hours to live, you become immune to anything.",depression,1

"Not really sure I approve, or at least not directly.    If a person thinks that dying is ok; is there any reason to not attempt a bucket ton of ECT?

I've started to think of it as a form of assisted suicide, where the family and associates of the person get to keep a working shell, and a newly generated person with some shared memories and a few features of the previous occupant.     The anesthesia used is sufficient that there is no pain during the procedure, and being clear about strong pain management afterwards should be more than sufficient to address the headaches that are common with it...

So basically, if you want to be euthanized for depression, you go in, do anesthesia, they kill you, family keeps the zombie and are happy.

I might have a bad attitude though.

A solution that is very difficult to achieve since survival is one of, if not, our strongest instinct. For somebody to actually force their way past their overwhelming fear and achieve suicide and in turn, escape a life that has become a prison for them, I feel that is deserving of respect.

""Temporary"" in this context could mean years if not decades. It's very difficult to ever completely over come long term depression. Ultimately I can't see what a person has experienced through their mind and body. So I don't like judging their reasons for suicide from my point for view. 

Are you referring to r/depression respecting suicide or societies in general? I can't say I've ever heard suicide respected in real life. And most religions put it in a very bad light. But r/Depression would since a lot of us have thought about suicide as a happy thought. It's a way to say to yourself ""Oh well, I failed. But at least I can end it when it gets too much to handle"".

Check this music video. The lead singer is fat. He is also awesome. He loves life even he is really overweight. The guy who plays Tyrone Lannister from Game of Thrones. He is a midget (sorry if not being a PC but I can't remember if there was any other term for this and if this one is offensive or not [English is not my primary language]) and at the same time he is very popular, awesome and loved.

Those are just two examples I pulled out of my ass.

It's not always your looks. It is the fact that you don't like life. And people can see it and feel it.

Make a list. Think about things you don't like about yourself. Find the possible solutions. Start at least with the smallest ones or divide large ones in small, easy to do steps. 

My random examples. 

You have glasses and think they make you ugly/nerdy. Get contacts. 

Pale? Start tanning in a backyard carefully (protective creme, start slow). You will get colour and become healthier looking /will have better skin, with less spots and other problems. 

Fat? Don't go crazy with diets. Instead start with small steps. If you drink a lot of sugary drinks, switch to water or start making better lemonade for yourself (lemons, water and honey). Eat like normal but replace unhealthy snacks with fruits, diet snacks or similar. After some time start cutting on portions a little, or avoid some of the most unhealthy foods. Slowly change your eating habits. Even if you change just one habit every month or so, over a year it will add up a lot. 

Start cycling on the daily basis. Easier than running, still exercising and fun. 

Maybe have a ridiculous haircut that does not fit your at all and makes you look worse without you knowing? Google your facial features, which haircuts might suit you or just go to a decent hairdresser and ask them to recommend a haircut that might look good on you. Be nice to them, leave tips. 

Similar with clothes. Check/google what looks good on people of your size. Use those tips. Don't have to be expensive clothes.

Think your dick is too small? Like someone mentioned - maybe it looks that way because you are overweight and it looks relatively small to your big size. Also shave it. Will always look better when shaved. Do your armpits as well.

Join interest groups. Music, books, table games, cycling for beginners, whatever. Try to create your own group. You will find people who like same things as you and that is a good start.

Find difficult starting conversations? Read some awesome things on Reddit, remember 5 most interesting ones, which are perhaps not knows to everyone and introduce them into conversations. Find some funny jokes, write them down and keep on you or learn by heart.

Those are just a few things you can do to start changing yourself to become a person you like and others will like.

If you have other specific issues, you can PM me. Will try to help as much as I could.

P.S. Don't look at the whole picture too much at the moment. Start with small things. They will start adding up. If you will start big you will think that all is unachievable and will give up.

Suicide doesn't end the pain, necessarily. It just passes it on to other people. And even if it doesn't seem like anyone cares about you, I believe that those thoughts can be deceiving. There may be people who care about you much more than you think, even if it seems unlikely. Either way, life has so much more to offer, so many opportunities and people to see. Sometimes it can take years to get better, and it can all seem hopeless, but I think in the end, it's worth going through all that pain just to become better.

"Hello, I've been depressed twice, the last time being until two weeks ago, at which point I thought I would leave everything behind and forget I was even depressed. Since then' I've realized I couldn't do that, the fact that I've been depressed is not something I can ""delete"" from my life, it marked me, made me who I am and I know that I can use it to help others who are going through that something I know too well.

First of all, what you are feeling isn't unique to you and it does NOT make you weaker, on the contraire, the days you look weakest are precisely the ones you fight strongest. Depression is a hard beast to slay for sure, but acknowledging those to facts, despite what society says, is the biggest first step you will ever take.

As I previously said, depression is a hard beast to slay, but trust me once you do slay it (and you WILL slay it), it feels great - the memories you thought lost suddenly come back, the feelings you so much desired return stronger than even and, though you won't feel happy all the time, you will always see the light at end of the tunnel and fight your way to it.

I know all this seems distant and impossible to achieve, but it's not, as a matter of fact it's closer than you could ever imagine, I'm the living proof.

Though there’s not a single cure for depression, I will tell you what worked for me:

Ask for help – This one took me a while to accomplish, but when I found the courage to tell my best friend what I was feeling and asking her for support, I felt more confident on myself. By no means this cured my depression, it actually kept getting worst, but every time I was feeling down, I had her there to help me through it and that was invaluable for me.

Explain what you feel – This one goes hand-in-hand with the last one: Most people don’t know what depression is like and will just send you to a doctor, but you must tell them how you feel and that you’re not looking for medical expertise, you’re looking for a friend.

Find what you LOVE doing – This may seem like impossible to accomplish because “I don’t feel happiness anymore”, but trust me on this one. Whether it’s playing a sport, reading watching TV or gaming, you need to find something you ENJOY doing and DO it, it doesn’t have to be something new, you just have to enjoy it. I know how hard it can be to enjoy anything when you are depressed, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible, as a matter of fact. it’s possible and very worthwhile!

Be yourself – You are perfect the way you are, it’s not your fault you are depressed, it’s nobodies, people care about you (do you think I would write this if I didn’t) and want to see you defeating depression. Never forget who you are, don’t let a temporary problem steal your permanent self!

After I drove up to the resort and parked, I found out that she was staying on the 9th floor. After I get off the elevator I take note of the height at which I was currently standing; It'd been awhile since I'd been in a tall building like this, and I realize I'm pretty fucking high off the ground. 

I walk into the condo make stupid small talk, realize that I don't really have much to talk to anyone about, since it's my family and we don't really talk about much to begin with, and I excuse myself to the balcony. And that's when it hit me.

I stand up, with my waist against the rail, and just sort of...lean over a bit. It would be so easy, so quick, I tell myself. I could take one easy tip over this rail and all of this shit would be done. Wouldn't have to worry about explaining to these people that my life has been pretty fucked up and that I'm fucking miserable all the time. One tiny step, and in 7 seconds I'd be a puddle on the pavement.

In all honesty there is never a way to get better if you kill yourself. There is never a chance to go back. If you're at the point where you're ready to kill yourself.. just think about it, if it's the worst day of your life it isn't going to get worse and if there is even a worse day then that one day you were going to kill yourself wasn't all that bad after all. 

You never know what the future holds. If you think you're ugly and fat, start exercising, get yourself some gears turning. Once you see results and the people around you start noticing that's all the esteem you will need to get yourself going.

Uneducated and being broke can be fixed as well and I don't think I need to point out how.

I've not dealt with depression, but I have dealt with severe anxiety.

You need some physiological help to get your mind/body back in a good place and you need a professional to come beside you to help walk you through the journey. Trust me, this process works.

Additionally, realize that this is something you'll probably deal with the rest of your life. That idea can be scary, but coming to grips with it helps you fight through the tough times. Just tell yourself you are only responsible for making it through THIS DAY. Just today. Don't think about tomorrow, don't think about next week. You are only fighting for today.

"Depression has a lot to do with emotions. Note that depression is a state of mind, and it has a lot of symptoms. From what you are writing:   
1. Dropping hobbies: This is a sign of depression because people will often feel unmotivated that even their favorite hobbies can become tiresome.    
2. Need for company: A lot of people feel like they can't accomplish what they want unless they have someone else. It's not that they can't, but its more that depressed people want the reassurance that they are not alone.    
3. Introvert: Certainly not restricted to depression, but it is a sign. Its more that depressed people are introverted, rather than introverts are depressed people.   
4. Body size: Most likely genetics. I'm 5''2, but at the start of university, I ate more than my friends who were 6 feet. Crazy right? I used to swim everyday, and I needed a lot of fuel, whereas my 6 feet friends basically just sat in a chair.   
5. Appetite: Lack of appetite is a sign that things aren't going well. I don't know exactly the scientific reasoning behind this, but I think it has something to do with eating becoming a chore rather than a necessity.    
Overall, I think you have depression. And here's how I would cope with it.    
1. Go out and jog: I recommend jogging, but basically get out and get fresh air, and do some form of exercise. This will get blood flowing, blood carries oxygen, and your body will be fueled by oxygen (Krebs' cycle). Your brain will be stimulated, and you'll feel tired, but motivated due to increased brain activity.   
2. If you have trouble talking to people: Next time you order something, say ""Good morning/afternoon/evening, how are you?"" End with ""Thanks, have a great day/night/evening"". Be polite, its really important. Remember that talking takes practice, even though we do it everyday. Great speakers and people who are social probably practiced and observed thousands of conversation to eventually pick up on social cues.    
3. Walk tall: This can either do two things. One, people think you are confident, because confident people walk with their chest out. This is the desired result. Or, two, people think you are a showoff. Either way, people's perspective of you will change, but if you walk tall, you improve posture, and you might even gain a few inches. ",depression,1
"I think it's typical and most people feel the same. It's a misunderstanding that depressed people are depressed all the time, and you know it well. Also, if you have chronic depression (dysthymia), as opposed to one major depressive episode, it's perhaps more common that you have many okay days, since, well, it lasts for so long.

"I've always suffered from depression and anxiety, and went through periods of feeling suicidal in my teens. But the closet I ever came to it was last year (I'm now in my 30s). Following a nervous breakdown that led to me quitting my job and being out of work for two years I finally landed a job in a factory. Despite terrible conditions and nightshifts, it felt really good at first to be working again. But as the lack of sleep and mental stimulation wore me down, my mental health deteriorated. I kept applying for other jobs that were better conditions and pay (and much more in line with the professional work I did before my breakdown) but didn't even get as far as an interview or call back. My self worth went to shit as a felt like a burden on my wife and kids, and it became impossible to imagine things ever improving. Every waking minute was spent ruminating on what a failure I was, or thinking of killing myself. This went on for almost a year. If I didn't have my wife and kids depending on me, I'm certain I would have gone through with it. The hopelessness I felt seemed so certain that suicide felt like the only rational solution (as long as I did it in a way that didn't look like suicide, so my family would get my life insurance). 

Luckily a chance conversation with an old work friend from my old professional job led to a work from home job and things have improved considerably since. I'm still dealing with depression and anxiety, and my confidence and self worth are still very low, but I'm coping and I'm at least a little bit optimistic about the future. There are occasional set backs and dark periods, but that year of being suicidal seems like a bad dream now, it's just so far removed from my current mental state, although I'm always aware that it won't take much to make my mental health decline like that again.

The police will then do all their questioning, during which it will invariably be revealed at least to the parents of this dude about his deviant sexual proclivities. Given that it is probably a *really bad thing* for that to be made public (or known to other people), this is absolutely suicide material.

It is not such a marginal risk that you are making it out to be, either. The guy has expressed desires of suicide multiple times in the post, as well as a sexual desire that is extremely intolerable to most of society.

"Yeah, this was the first time I've ever gone to a therapist. She also had me take a group class where we read a chapter or two from [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Days-Self-Esteem-David-M-D-Burns/dp/0688094554) each week, and met and talked about it. I only really went to the first five classes, and at that point I felt that I ""got it"" and had the techniques that I needed to get my shit in order. A lot of other people there were a lot worse off than I was/am.

Now I meet with her about once a month, and talk to her about specific incidences or ongoing problems that I've been having, and she's been helping me realize that a lot of the anger and self-esteem issues stem from my upbringing and how insecure I felt as a child. My parents' influence was very strong, and harmful, it turns out. But knowing the origins has helped me to realize that a lot of this isn't my fault, but it's still my responsibility to love myself in spite of these things, and help myself get better.

>I feel like I just go there to bitch an unload, something I could do with the few friends I have, but never gain any techniques or tips. 

My therapist wouldn't let me do that. She lets me explain what's going on, but then she will break it down with me and go over it with me to help me figure out why I felt the way I was feeling or why I'm feeling the way I'm feeling about that situation. And she helps me figure out different ways to think about the situation that's more helpful.

>The only example I have of an actual process being learned is the breathing technique for anxiety attacks, which I no longer suffer from.

It's not like there's a technique that's like a ""magic trick"" that's going to make us better. It's more like that this is an ongoing process of us becoming aware of ourselves and of how we're choosing to react to stimuli, and where our initial/instinctual reactions (that are oftentimes overblown or detrimental because they're overblown) stem from. 

Once I figured out where my depression, anger and anxiety was stemming from, and the fact that she helps me remember that or see it anew each time I see her, it's really helping those incidents become more and more rare.

And she has great suggestions... For instance, she said that there have been studies that have shown that people who are more grateful/thankful for things tend to be less depressed than those who don't make a habit of noticing things and being grateful for them. So she suggested that for the next month I work on noticing things that I'm grateful for, and talking about how I'm grateful for those things, with the people around me. It really helped me become more positive. 

Little things like that, little tips and tricks, really have helped me.

Also, I would also highly recommend the app called ""Happify"". I have it on my iPhone and it's really a wonderful little app. Very encouraging and helpful.

"Okay not necessarily. if you are shy and keep to yourself people will generally keep there distance. Joining a gym doesn't automatically let you meet people or boost your self esteem in one day. 

Here are some tips though that might help.

1. Run on the treadmill
When you run you build your endurance and will power. That feeling when you can't go on any longer but do it anyway is really great. Try it.

2. Look for someone who's your build (body type) working out alone.
What you do is work out close to them and then ask them for a spot*. From there you can do some small talk or if they seem like douche bags just thank them and be on your way.

3. Try finding the regulars and ask for workout advise.
Most gym rats love talking about themselves and their work out routines. So just ask for advise. Most likely you'll get some solid conversations. 

Try these man. They're not gonna make you the most popular guy there but at the very least you'll feel like a part of the gym instead of just a stranger feeling out of place. Good luck!

I'm not one for the whole suicide is selfish argument... unless you have kids that YOU chose to have that literally depend on you to make sure they don't grow up to be completely dysfunctional. And yes having a parent commit suicide does tend to mess you up. You know what depression and mental issues are like, why would you willingly inflict that on anyone, much less your own kids?

"I went through a similar situation. I'm 18 and the only girlfriend I've ever had, only kisses, only sex, only love, etc. She dumped me 2 months ago because I became attached. She said things that made me want to end my life. On top of this I had 2-3 other major problems that piled on top and made everything incredibly worse. I texted her this morning to show her that I changed, that I was a new man, that although I was depressed and my anxiety were killing me and i was going through a terrible time that I could and would change. And she doesn't care, she said more hurtful things and told me to not talk to her. I tried running, I tried smoking weed and drinking, I tried everything except growing up and fixing myself deep down inside. And you know what? 90% of my other problems are gone, or do not effect me. I smiled and was extremely happy yesterday. Everything is great. Except for her. I am not strong enough to get over her, or fix what is wrong there, I can't get back with her and that's all I want. I want something I cannot have and that I do not want to just get over. But there is no other choice. So I currently am sitting in college classes right now on this subreddit telling my story to people, offering help however I can, doing whatever I can to make sure people do not feel the way that I do. I can't make her want you again, I can't tell you how to get back with her or that she will ever want to, but what I can tell you is that I know EXACTLY how you feel. That I will ANYTHING to help you. That you need ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD I will do what I can to help. I may be depressed, I may wear my heart on my sleeve and get hurt because I try to help and I get emotional and all that, but I am a good guy and if you need anything I am here. If you have a PS4, or PC game, or even just want to text or call me and cry or talk or anything. Please tell me. The one thing that actually puts a smile on my face is seeing myself help others, seeing them smile and laugh, because that means for even a second they aren't feeling what I am, and I know that it feels amazing to have any kind of break. 

Please tell me what you need, how I can help, or anything. No one deserves to feel the way many of us do, but many of us are not strong enough to carry themselves and others, to push through and do what needs to be done. I'm offering to do this, not only for you, but anyone that reaches out to me for help, or that I see needs help and I am able to contact.

Also, they aren't celebrating her getting rid of you. They are celebrating her getting into a new relationship. Period, end of sentence. That's a feeling nearly everyone relates to, like seeing a sunset, or enjoying a delicious drink.

Just be happy that you're alive you know? Life is short and it's going to be over anyway, so there's no reason to get out early when you're not going home crying every day. Some people are meant to be alone (me included) and I just sit in my room all day and hide away because I have anxiety and no one's ever seemed to like me. You just have to be comfortable with who you are and figure out what you're good at and take advantage of that. Look at Stephen King. That guy is horrendous and he's married, talented, and famous. Don't worry about your speech impediment. Some people just aren't meant to have perfect speech. For example, I have a huge underbite and it messes up with my speech too and so every time I talk I have to make sure to enunciate every letter to make sure the other person understands me. It's really annoying because I don't see anyone else try so hard to enunciate when I have to every time. Otherwise, if I don't, it just comes out as gibberish.

I just got a part time job this year. I felt like my best friend didn't care about me anymore when she stopped calling me. That she was too busy to want to hang out with me like we used to 2 years ago. That she found new people to be friends with and I was left in the dust. 


But that wasn't the case. I learned that being supported by your parents is okay. Yes, I do want independence, but I understand it is very hard in this economy. Yes, I'm still in school, but at least I have the opportunity to still be in school and finish. I didn't think I would ever get a job, but I did and I'm happy.

The depression/anxiety exasperated my ADD immensely to where I couldn't function in my normal capacity, particularly concerning school and work.

I started taking an antidepressant, SSRI's to be exact, coupled with therapy, and over course of about a year it really turned my life around. I was able to focus again and evaluate my situatuon; stop the bleeding, if you will, and i just went from there. It didn't happen all at once, but slowly I got to the point to where I felt I didn't need the medication anymore. Medication isn't the answer for everyone, and it won't take care of all your problems on your own, but it can help to stabilize your situation. Also, if you do end up taking medication, remember it takes about a month for SSRI's (what they will likely prescribe) to begin taking effect, so be patient.

"I'm a psychologist . Over the last 19 years of treating people for Depression and Anxiety a common contributing factor in the development of depression is a critically low self-esteem. Even though the symptoms of depression particularly, poor motivation low energy and poor concentration to mention a few can affect your confidence, it's developing self esteem that is a critical step in treating depression. Self esteem is an important coping mechanism as it will help get you out of your comfort zone without experiencing anxiety. Unfortunately too many therapists focus more on symptoms and not enough on the contributing factors and on developing strong coping skills. www.corinnecoe.com.au",depression,1

"I went down this road a few years ago and felt helped by it. I ended up at a weird crossroads with it though. I totally agree with the concept that suffering is caused by desire and that if we can control our thoughts, stop always wishing to be somewhere except from where we are here and now, we can prevent a lot of pain. The problem I had with it is that it almost works too well. In the sense that I really could work myself into a state of contentment, but maybe negative emotions exist for a reason to spur us to make changes and improve the things that are hurting us. 

It's almost exactly the issue I've always had with the idea of medication. Sure, maybe taking a pill might make me feel better. But if I'm depressed because of the state of my life, not having friends and companionship, not having accomplished much by 30, the pill might be able to make me feel better.... but I'm not sure that I should be trying to make it more bearable to sit alone in my house year after year. 

So I became equally perplexed by the idea of just stomping down my desires and practicing contentment. If I had a million dollars in the bank and could get through the rest of my life just sitting here content, it might work. But it clashes with the real world. Not wanting things means it's okay for me to not be working, it's okay to maybe never have a house or find love, and I can control my thoughts enough to stop hurting over it... but where does that leave me at the end of the day. 

On paper, I still agree with much of it. ""The search for happiness is the leading cause of unhappiness"" and all of that. So much of what you see posted on a message board like this is people hurting over the things they want but don't have, the people they wish they were but aren't, and if you can control those desires, you can find some sort of peace. 

It could also hinge on the fact that I have always considered myself to have ""situational sadness"" more than ""clinical depression"". I don't think anything is wrong with my brain. I think I'm sad for very many reasons. So again, leaning on some sort of belief system that just tells me to try to clear my mind and practice contentment, that's all fine and good until I'm 70 years old and realize I lulled myself into a lifetime of nothingness. 

Perhaps I had some misunderstanding of the teachings. Maybe zen doesn't specifically say it's wrong to strive for things or to pursue goals. But it sure seemed to me that the message was to try to stop always wanting things, stop sitting on the shore and looking across the water at the other island that looks prettier from where you're sitting, just to swim over there and then start wishing you could be somewhere else again. 

I'll check out the book. Maybe it'll clear some things up for me. I forget which ones I read a few years ago. ",depression,1

"I believe the nature of depression is that it makes you assume the worst during uncertainty. You might look at an assignment and think its impossible.  But if you start, do a little bit, and re-evaluate, you've made progress! There is now evidence that you can do it.

When you get stuck for a moment, there is hesitation.  You MIGHT NOT be able to do this.  So depression kicks in, and makes you feel that you can't do it.

You need to really convince yourself that you want to do this thing, and that it's worthwhile, and that you CAN do it.  Then take it on in manageable chunks, and prove to your depression that it's lying.",depression,1

I'll never say you should have a family, that'd just leave orphans behind. But have you tried getting a career? Try having a lot of expendable income, a threesome with some coke and hookers maybe. Try to feel what people see as nirvana.

It's easy to not want, are you ready to not lose? Because you never know if that's actually what you needed all along. Just know that you don't get to quickload after that, you never get a second chance. Don't waste it, leave apathy behind and try things!",depression,1

There may be people who care about you much more than you think, even if it seems unlikely. Either way, life has so much more to offer, so many opportunities and people to see. Sometimes it can take years to get better, and it can all seem hopeless, but I think in the end, it's worth going through all that pain just to become better.

"Hi there! First of all, I'm so, so sorry you're going through this and everything you already did went through as well. My heart goes out to you, and I offer you a tight internet hug. 

Secondly, it seems like you've developed Panic Syndrome... I'm not a professional to diagnose but I used to have the exact same awful symptoms as you are experiencing; most nights I'd sleep only 3 hours, stomach always complaining, the feeling of losing control, panic attacks that would last for hours, the awful stimuli from all around making me terrified all the time, the feeling of not being able to breathe, zaps throught my body - it's abolutely awful. After spending the worst weeks of my life thinking I was dying too, I was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with Panic Syndrome. I had gone through some tough things - my parents divorced too, in a very messy way, and then my mom moved away to a different town - and just when I thought I was getting over them, boom. Panic syndrome showed up, like a very shitty unwelcome surprise. 

But the things that really helped during the worst of it were the support of loved ones and learning more about the syndrome; the more you know about it, the more you rationalize it and the more you can take a hold of it! Breathing exercizes help too, and also just having someone next to you when the worst of the symptoms show up can really calm you down and opening up to people close to you really makes the fight easier. Other thing that helped was medication and for a while psychological support, but I understand that it might not be easily viable in America... Other thing that helped was reaching out to people with the same problems. Knowing you're not alone in what you're feeling is really grounding.

The most important thing that you should know about this is that you're absolutely not alone, dying or losing control. Panic Syndrome is awful, but you can tackle it! It's terrifing and a tiring fight, specially coupled with depression and OCD (which I also have), but believe me: you got this. And if you ever need to talk about this, just hit me up! I know it's hard, but you'll get better with time. I did, and you definitely can too! 

All the best for you and I'm cheering for your recovery! &lt;3",depression,0

"Yeah I missed a lot of school. I didn't really know that I was depressed in high school. I knew something was wrong with me but I was taught by society that depression is another word for sadness, so I never really knew how to explain how I was feeling and never wanted to fearing being put back into a mental ward. I always told my teachers that I was sick ( I guess I really was), but eventually I was kicked out for missing too many days.

I didn't really realize that my breakdowns and feelings of pain and hate were depression until it was too late.",depression,0
"Emotionally stunted, to me, means not having the depth of emotions people should and not reading others emotions. But I am talking about knowing the right thing to do with those emotions, and we often learn very dysfunctional things instead. Indeed, your lack of relationships should be a big read flag that some method you were taught (this can be things like ""man up!"" or ""try to solve problems instead of listen"") isn't working...

Hmmm. My line of thinking is that you say you're successful in every other domain of life (looks, health, job, life situation, etc) but don't mention anything about your internal state beyond ""I'm happy! but I'm so lonely I could shoot myself"". Can you see how strange that sentence sounds?

The fact that you're so lonely says to me that you also don't have close friends to confide in (I could be wrong). Not having *any* intimate relationships, let alone romantic ones, makes me think that's where the problem lies - in a difficulty in making strong connections. The fact that you have difficulty talking about these skills and also how you feel in depth makes me think you have a hard time with them and that there in lies the shortcoming.  Maybe you have some feelings that are unprocessed and unresolved manifesting as irritability or other symptom that people find off-putting.   

But of course I am basing this off the selective information you have provided that are only some words on the internet.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

"Remind him of the good traits he has. When he's down, suggests things you guys could do together whenever he feels better. Nudge him towards therapy and/or medication. Be patient with him. You can give advice to him but go in without the expectation that he will take it or that it will help, otherwise it'll just cause him guilt and he may distance from you more. Leave sticky notes in the apartment with casual messages when you go out so he feels less alone. Nudge him towards his hobbies and interests. Keep on inviting him to events and hangouts, even if he says no 90% of the time. Ask him if he wants someone to just sit in his room, not necessarily to talk. Remind him that he will eventually get better, even if he doesn't feel well right now, and you'll do these things for him while he recovers. Emphasizing the transience of his depression will keep as much hope alive as possible, as well as reminding him that he's not completely helpless and pathetic for needing help, because this is a phase in his life that will pass. Think of it this way. He literally has a disease because depression is a disease, and it renders him unable to get out of bed sometimes. So it's like having a debilitating physical illness that keeps him in the hospital except the hospital is his room and it doesn't nearly have as much resources as a real hospital.

My goal isn't to ""overcome"" it because that's unrealistic. My main goal since I decided to be more open about it, and the reason I opened up, is to find a way to turn my disorder into a positive. Use it as best I can to help others on their walk through life. Even though I don't have all the answers, and still working through a ton of stuff.

"What you're saying is a product of your depression and supposed mental inferiority.

First off, being depressed can make your school performance worse. It's happened to me, and there was a time where I believed I was stupid too. I'm not. I'm pretty above average. 

I used to get 100s on Alg 2 tests last year, but then came a time when I was putting the same effort and the tests were the same difficulty that I started getting low 80s. I remember my counselor pulling me aside and asking what's wrong-- I didn't realize it then, but I realize it now. I was letting my depression influence my performance in school. 

Second off, when you're depressed, you like to think of events and memories that validate your problems. It's what we do. I'd like to call it confirmation bias. For me, I used to struggle with anxiety. So I blamed it on me being bullied when I was a kid. I realized that it wasn't so much that, because it actually had no impact on my life whatsoever. Rather, it was because I suffered from addiction and then engaged in antisocial behaviors. 

Third of all, you're overthinking the issue. You're probably more self aware than the people around you. Most people don't really understand themselves like you understand yourself. I was there, and I understand. When I was depressed, I would think A TON. It was the only thing I could really do.

Looking back, I feel like I don't actually believe in anything that I thought. 

We as humans only need to have a very limited understanding of ourselves to be happy. Which is why when it no longer becomes necessary, we may lose our self awareness. Most people aren't as self aware as you because they don't overthink it. When you overthink things while you are depressed, you may see it as a ""depressing truth"", or ""sad realization"". The reality is, most of it isn't true. The more you think about something doesn't make it true. 

I've found that the only truth that you actually should and will believe is based on experience. Not by critical analysis of yourself. I may be assuming too much of you, but I feel like you're not living life to it's fullest. I may also be wrongly associating my experience with your experience, which--haha i'm overthinking it too, am I not? 

You could be hindered by you overthinking things. 

Fourth, you shouldn't compare yourself to others. How you see others and how you see yourself are 2 very different things. How you see others depends is probably based on a few moments worth of outside appearance. They may seem smart, but maybe it's just a joke a friend told them which they happen to remember. They may actually feel stupid on the inside..

While I admit that isn't true all of the time, it still is some of the time. You probably have an unrealistic intelligence standard based on what you see compared to what you see in yourself.

What you see in yourself is a completely different perspective. You know yourself alot better than you know others. The comparison is incompatible. You are consciously aware of things on the inside that may affect how your outwardly perform. You aren't aware of the things on the inside of others' brains, so you can only see them on the outside. When you say ""my idiocy has become one of my defining features"", that's probably inside your head too. Others probably don't see you this way. 

Fifth, you shouldn't feel depressed over this. If anything, I've always felt that ignorance was bliss. Now you're not ignorant. You claim to have low intelligence because you think you're slow. But there's a whole wide world of intelligence. You may only be focusing on the ones you lack, rather than the ones you may not know you have. (just look up the different types of intelligence)...

And there's no reason to feel bad about this. We all have things in life that we lack. Nobody here is perfect, but it's not so much of as ""what the sad truth is"" rather, it's ""what perspective we have to make the most of what we're born with"". I'm not saying that what you're saying is a ""sad truth""... Because frankly, I think you're just being wayy too pessimistic. I know that this is a jerk think to say, but I feel like you're being delusional about your actual ""lack of intelligence."" It's really hard to see in the dark, and what you said resonates with how I felt when I was depressed. Looking back, I was just delusional. But aren't we all? It's hard to see life as it is, we're all going to make realizations as we live life. 

So anyways, I hope it helped. 

Edit: And I seriously hope that you don't feel antagonized by any of this. I'm aware that what I said was probably rash and you probably already knew like half of this. You may know 90% of all there is to know about your problems, but missing the 10% is crucial info that can really shape the whole perspective you have.

Please don't believe too strongly about this. That's only setting yourself up so you stay depressed. Just let your mind relax, wait a few days, and see if you still believe the same way. 

PS Again, I feel like you may already know half of what I just said. 

PSS I feel like a fucking idiot talking about the dunning kruger effect when you already mentioned you knew about it. And also the different types of intelligences. ",depression,0

"That sounds rough, sorry to hear you're going through this. 

Sounds like you could really use a break. Have you considered speaking to a doctor about the way you're feeling? Not necessarily about the social interactions, but it seems like you could be suffering from some self esteem issues, anxiety and depression. 

Aside from that, my advice would maybe be to stop trying? It seems counter intuitive, but often times people can detect when you want a relationship from a mile away and it can be intense when you've just met someone. 

Maybe you could focus on yourself and on making friends for a little while? Pick a time period, promise to do something each day that's going to have positive future impact (read a book, learn something new, join a class, cheer a friend up, etc) 

You'll probably find that once you stop focusing so much on the girls and start improving your own life and confidence, the relationship side of things will just come naturally.

Also try using others methods of showing of your resume/profile on job site (indeed,snabajob,ect) they actually increase you chances of finding thing that can accommodate to your requirement like not having experience or education plus time and location bit other than that don't give up I was told that I can fill out a hundred applications but only 5 might call but even so make.it work show them you are worth it",depression,0

I think if you are close with the person it will effect you forever I don't think you can just get over something like that no matter how much time passes. You just deal with it better as times passes but you never forget. It will stay with you forever and will hurt that you couldn't do more to help the person or blame yourself when really there was nothing you could do. I agree on the part though the person suffering such servere depression probably did and was suffering way more than the loved ones left behind. ,depression,0

"I have been there too.  I doubt anyone can put together a magic set of words that will fix the way you feel right now.  But, if I may make an observation; it seems you have isolated yourself from the world.  Obviously, I don't know your whole life nor what you do based on what you wrote above but please look honestly at your life and see if that is the case.  I am 48 years old and live with a lot of regrets due to also experiencing that very same feeling when I was young.  I found out through the course of my life I needed to push my way into life.  I waited for several years for someone to pull me into life, whether it be a friend or a potential mate, that never happened.  I had to push my way in, meaning I started volunteering and joining groups.  This put me in a position to be around others with common goals in mind which fostered friendships and built life long relationships.  Also, it kept me busy so I didn't have to be alone with nothing to do except look at all my short comings.  Here is the hardest part of pushing my way into life.  My best friends Dad used to tell us all the time that ""shy boys don't get kisses.""  He meant that you have to choose not to be shy.  It was very difficult for me to be outgoing with out a wing man to help.  I decided to become outgoing with people I didn't know and strike up conversations out of the blue.  IT WAS HARD!  I feared failure and rejection every time.  But in the end I was never afraid of people or being shy, I was afraid of failure and rejection.  I was afraid that people would only confirm what I felt about myself.

I did it and made life long friends and attracted girls easily.  It was never about my looks, intelligence or income, it was about overcoming my own doubts about myself.  I'm sorry if this seems preachy or like Dad talk.  I truly hope this helps you.  PLEASE don't let life pass you by.  Someday when you're my age, you don't want to live with regrets of things that were in your control the whole time.",depression,0

"Damn that's rough. Sorry to hear that man, I just hope you learn how to cope with how shitty life is currently before it jades you too much. 

People, teenagers especially, are very selfish beings. I think recognizing this in yourself and your friends might give you some insight as to why things feel one way or why people think another. Your friends might just think you're a bummer if the first thing you say after being gone for 2 weeks is ""I was in a psych ward"" and expecting sympathy. It sucks I know because all you really want is positive attention but dealing with people your age you should be ready to give it to receive it from other people. Personally if someone told me that I'd feel pretty uncomfortable because I wouldn't know what to say besides, ""that sucks man"". 

School isn't the end of the world, you're almost done. The only solace I can give is that you're only 1 year away from having more control over your life and how you steer it. If you end up going to college then you have a larger pool of people to interact with that might suit you better as well as more range of freedom on what you do with your spare time. If not you won't be forced to deal with people you don't like. 

Best of luck man.

Don't blame yourself though. As a suicidal person, I think I can relate to how he felt and according to his behaviour, he really loved you and probably didn't put the blame on anybody else than the vision he had of the world and society he saw. A suicide letter is the last statement of one into this world. Take it as it is, the most honest and unfiltered thing he could ever have said. If he stated you as his reason to live, he meant it and you probably helped him to hold on longer to life. You aren't responsible in anyway, it was his choice.

Has he taken care of himself that day? (Like has he eaten or showered) Those kind of things make you feel better even if it's the last thing you feel like doing.

Why should i have a girl friend ? when the real fact that i'd be more depressed when we broke off ?

"tl;dr: Going numb is a normal response to being depression, shocked, or scared. 

From what i understand, going numb is a defensive mechanism. We have all these limbic responses to threats and danger, whether they be physical or mental. For physical or social threats a person might freeze, or go into the fight or flight responses. For mental stuff, going numb is a response to your mental state being bombarded with stress and/or fear.  (Source: What every BODY is saying, Joe Navarro) 

I go numb a lot with my depression. Today was a particularly bad day for me as well, and i just ended up spaced out on my couch. You shut off everything on the outside, and sit in the mist of your brain, and try to process.   

I can also relate to the urge to breakdown and process it. Because, i think, we get tired of going numb. We can't do anything in that state. So you wish you could just meltdown, reset, and start over.  

My advice is to just get out and do something. Read, play games, try to hang out with friends. Real friends, that you know you can be yourself around and have a good time with. The kind of friends that make you forget your troubles. Then you can reset, pick yourself up, and try again. ",depression,0

It's AMAZING you have an emotional body guard. I had that once.
Somehow the guy I am with now is not only the most emotionless guy I've ever met (and I'm an emotionless person), he's cold.

In few words the reason I was even like this, drunk and alone is: I've been having a terrible few weeks. Flew up to our college town to stay with him, had too much to drink, we got into a fight and I said, ""I'm packing my stuff up and going."" He said go for it. I fell as I was walking out (because I was drunk). He shut the door behind me.

Mind you, this was in Oakland (a very dangerous area). I had all my bags, heels, prada purse.... Went to a bar like a lost puppy and drank. Planning to lay in traffic. A GANGSTER asks me what's up. I ignore him. He keeps asking me. I tell him a bad time.
Then we have to leave the bar because it's 2am and walk out together. 

I blacked out. I wake up in a bookstore with the dude. I ask him where my stuff is... He said I left them in the street but he brought them.

The story finishes embarrassingly. I never heard from my ""bf"" and I was still wholeheartedly wanting to die. I basically did a bad drug with this dude (that I would never ever do) and hung out in gangsterville until my plane flight home.

My ""bf"" still contends that I'm a grown women and he's not my parent and can't babysit me. I told him I needed somebody to protect me.

Note: I've NEVER packed up and left my boyfriends house. I'm never dramatical like that. Something was wrong with my brain.

Edit: woke up in bookstore because he was living in a bookstore (makes no sense to me....). He asked me for money, I gave him money. He could have stolen all my stuff but didn't and stole from every store we went to and asked me to steal for him (I would not). Was fucked up and drunk the whole weekend and still feel bad about it because I don't do drugs or drink.

I COULD HAVE BEEN GANG RAPED AND ROBBED.  Not sure why this guy just hung out with me all weekend and shower genuine concern.

He also tried to get me to prostitute. I said no and scolded him for asking an educated white girl to prostitute. He was fine with it.

"Losing trust is awful. I can relate about stalking the girl's online stuff. In my situation I wound up getting the other girl reprimanded in her program at college. It's not something I look back on with a lot of pride. 

You seem like you're displacing a lot of anger that should probably be directed at your BF at this girl. If you're trying to work things out, I know it seems worse to be angry at him than at the girl, but the only thing she represents is the betrayal. Going after her isn't making things better, and it sounds like it isn't even cathartic anymore.

It's possible can get through it with your BF.  In my situation, yeah, we made it. That was almost 15 years ago now, and it was really hard and I was very angry.

"My Aspergers gives me an eye for detail instead of plot - I notice things that others don't and learn most skills and ideas rapidly. Sometimes I miss the overall picture with things though but overall this is an advantage.

My ADHD gives me hyperfocus. I can work for hours without stopping on things I'm interested in, and I have sharp reflexes and senses. I'm very easily bored, and this can result in total inactivity and depression. However, I got out of that pattern recently by going to a support group, meeting likeminded people, and reading about it. I also use a drug to increase my dopamine and sustain hyperfocus.

Society has trained you wrong. I was depressed because I was told to conform like everyone else - the Aspergers brain just doesn't work that way.

When I was younger (and had no clue about AS) I started reading books and articles on body language and also seduction. It was enough to improve my confidence and social awareness and everyone was so happy that I had 'changed' (I didn't know what they meant at the time). I've started reading again lately (particularly Robert Greene's books) and the change has been phenomenal. Last night I spent 8h socialising with my family, which before was unheard of.

Look at it this way: these disorders are entirely genetic. That means the genes are either a sexually selective advantage, or they are a byproduct of something else. AS is also correlated with higher intelligence, and many famous and successful people have/had AS. Play to your strengths and you'll blow people away. Even better: play to their strengths and you might even learn to socially outmaneuver anyone. Humans are just biological machines like any other animal: predictable and irrational.

I'd love to time travel this to my younger self, because life is total shit when everyone is too scared to call you 'different' when that approach is just what you need.",depression,0

"There are definitely ways to help. It is ignorant to say that you can get over it if you work hard enough, and it's just as ignorant saying you can't do anything about it. There are countless proven ways to help deal and overcome depression. 

To answer your question, I see it as you're fighting someone bigger, stronger, smarter, faster and just better than you. To say you can beat him if you just keep punching him is silly and ignorant. Yes, suicide in this case is just forfeiting. However, life isn't a boxing match with a time limit (I mean technically we all die but that's not the point). You can use your unlimited time out to work on yourself, train, and eventually be better than him. Reality is that as much as he can try to stop you and fight you while you're trying to build yourself, it takes courage and a lot of bravery to tell him to stop and go over on his side. That courage and shit is all inside you. He's still there, glaring at you, making eye threats, but you can tell him to hold up. Eventually when you're bigger and better than he is, he wouldn't even want to be fighting you anymore. You can always seek help.

Honestly I'm not sure how to curb it but I experience this quite badly too.

I also end up buying quite a bit of makeup &amp; bath bomb &amp; shit even thought I haven't managed to really wear any in over a year without immediately after putting it on having the intense desire to scrub it all of as I can't stand how I look in it.

"Thanks for all the comments guys.

I just wish more people would think before they make children. I was 3 weeks late when i was born. Almost died together with my mother. She had 2 or 3 misscarriages before me ( my guess is due to alchocol, smoking, and chemicals she inhaled doing painting jobs n stuff ). If i look at this from ezotherical perspective all i see is that two or 3 kids before me decided to jump out and i was the only one willing or strong enough to pull trough, and even then didn`t want to come into this world and almost chose death before i was even born.

To the sperm argument - i'm the strongest one of million sperm cells my father had... AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT, which could just as well be while being drunk, and doctors already had told his sperm is really weak, so chances are that i just got lucky to get to an egg, simply because of circumstances, not because i'm the strongest one he had. And even if it was so - my genes are predispositioned to depression addiction and shitty body structure which makes me sloppy shoulder fat clumzy shit despite my best efforts to lift weights and diet.

I've done enough drugs to see the universe and believe there is another chance and life / living never ends that you just continue. And i also think that the bullshit about suicide is just human-made concept to keep people from acting on impulsive ideas to kill themselves. If universe is such a magnificent thing as you can see when you do hard drugs - then my guess is that it wouldn`t have a need to ""punish"" you for desiring to TRY SOMETHING ELSE ( aka okay i fucked up this was not a good choice to live in this life, let me try something else and experiance that ).

Thing is - i'm on 3 anti-depressants which have helped me to reduce suicidal thoughts from 24/7 to once every two weeks. i'm able to function barely and get very minimal stuff done in order to provide for myself. I exercise, and am in healthy bodyweight, and even though i struggle with food addiction ( and other substances which i have successfully abstain from cause those at least i can simply avoid completely unlike food )... even if i eat right and do my best to meditate, journal - it never gets better... it's been close to decade now and it does't get better. it just gets worse as i see people around me being able to live normal lifes ( and by normal i mean not social standarts, but healthy human being in all aspects of life thats capable of living life and enjoy it ), while i'm barely getting by... Thats how it has always been - me dragging behind everyone and trying to catch up and using every bit of energy, no matter how hard i work and discipline myself, i can`t even reach AVERAGE.

And while i don't have suicidal thoughts, i still wish there could be a button that would allow to just restart this game, try a new server, different map, give another shot instead of continuing playing with cards that just can`t do anything. Even in poker there is ability to fold and let others play when they think they can.

Are you still alive? I read your posts and I was just wondering how long it takes for the average human to just say fuck it and end the suffering. My story started differently but it sounds like it might end the same. I have endured far more than anyone else I know and people around me are asking how I do it and I can't even let anyone know the truth is I'm done - I tried to let my friends know how I felt and they almost got angry at the thought of this mighty rock they go to with all their bullshit has finally been eroded into non existence. All I want to do is go home to my mom because I don't understand the things that wear human faces here - they are benevolent and selfish and seem to want to devour every part of my being but my mom is dead almost a decade and fuck sakes I'm jealous she got to exit already and left me here with these things that pretend to be people. It's been 3 straight weeks of torture this time and I'd just like to know when does it actually end.,depression,0

I have serious trouble getting out of bed and I feel the same 24/7: empty and somewhat sad although I don't feel much emotions. I like being with my girlfriend because she's usually quite happy and supportive, but all her saying that I'll be fine (she knows I'm often not happy, not that I'm depressed) just makes me mad and wanting to be alone.. Well that's it for now, until next week I suppose.

"People use the word ""friend"" too liberally.

Two things you should consider 1: 90% of the humans you will interact with are rank cowards.  2: Most humans will only have one or two close friends their whole life. The kind who you can count on to be there for you when things are bleak are EXTREMELY RARE.

The majority of your, and everyone else's, social life is little more than an agonizing game of masquerade.

In any case you cannot find a cure for depression in those people.

"Sometimes its perspective. They have been living like that all their lives so they don't know any other way. And like you said, your friend does creative things that give them a focus. Looking at it cynically, you could say its denial. But I would like to think that they see the cards they're dealt, and they don't quit the game. They keep pushing on to make the most out of what they have. Again, its a matter of perspective. They probably still have their ups and downs, but they still put on a brave face to others. Don't forget that all of this doesn't just come from just them, they get their motivation from other people, too. ",depression,0

"I'm sorry to hear of your troubles my friend. I was in a similar position to you once upon a time, where I felt like I simply didn't belong anywhere so I can somewhat relate (although I appreciate that your circumstances are unique to you). 

What really helped me was reading Victor Frankl's ""Mans search for meaning"". A book that explains a body of science called ""logotherapy"", an important part of which is the importance of having a purpose in your life. 

The beautiful thing about life is that we get to set our own purpose, (although with depression finding and setting a purpose for yourself can be very difficult). 

Setting a purpose for myself really helped with my depression. The feeling of being alone became less and less of a burden to me, as well as the general feeling and fear of being lost in life. 

Do you think setting a purpose for your life could maybe be of help?

It's also okay to not feel up to doing all the cliche things to get over depression (Exercise, hobbies etc). However it is important to note that they really do work, bringing yourself to do them is the hardest part.

I just don't want to deal with any more rejection from professionals. I also have a complex about needing to have people in authoritative positions to be competent, because otherwise my world fails to function, so I'd rather believe he is than evaluate whether he may not be.
