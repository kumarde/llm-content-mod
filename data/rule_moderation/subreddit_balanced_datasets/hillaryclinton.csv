And very honestly, I'd say it is very different. The basement dwellers comment was obviously disparaging, while this was not disparaging in any way until the media somehow agreed on an interpretation that anyone can see isn't there.  And now it's front page news, per this post.

Trump can definitely speak before thinking, I have no illusions about that and don't agree with everything he says.  But I disagree this is the opposite of the boy that cried wolf.  When the media pulls stuff like this, a person only has to find them being disingenuous once for them to question how if they've been disingenuous the rest of the time, even if Trump deserved the flak he was getting on some of the other occasions.",hillaryclinton,1

"Well, if Bernie had won the primary, how the fuck would you be able to tell me that he rigged the election against the establishments' preffered candidate?
Do you just not care about the fact that the DNC funnelled money to Hillary Clinton, and they stacked the deck on her side from the very beginning? Is that democracy to you?
That's why I'm not voting for Hillary. Voting for her would be an immoral decision, just as voting for Trump would be immoral. I voted for Bernie, because he actually fights for what he believes in. He never tried to force anyone to vote for him.
Can you even tell me what it is that Hillary believes in? Do you know? Does anyone really know? She has lied time after time, and she has no credibility anymore.
So, your perspective is that Hillary Clinton is our only hope, even though she has pissed away her lead on Trump, and she's having medical issues now which are only gonna make her tank in the polls even more.
Bernie had double digit leads over Trump in multiple polls, while Hillary always had less of a lead over Trump compared to Bernie.
She is failing the Democratic party. She has gone on, and on about how she is gonna beat Trump, and she still hasn't gained anything resembling a safe lead on him.

They should vote the way their state voted. The only reason I even supported this faithless electors thing is because with Trump, electors had a real reason not to vote for him. His various conflicts, his troubling ties, his behavior alone. When a candidate like that comes along, that's a good reason to go against the will of the people on a state-basis.

The incident caught on camera was a chair lifted up by yes, an angry person who either wanted attention (most likely, in my opinion), or intended to throw it. The person didn't end up throwing the chair, so I don't think that his statement is factually correct.

Were awful things said? Absolutely. Will the correct jurisdiction police officers investigate death threats? Also absolutely. I think in the end though if you are going to talk strictly about physical violence, there was only one person arrested for physical violence and they were not a Sanders supporter.",hillaryclinton,1

"The problem is accepting the Right's argument that the Left is the one separating people according to ""identity politics."" It is a fact that a given black man's interaction with our criminal justice system is likely different from that of a young white man's. The people pointing this out are not playing ""identity politics."" The people who don't want to *DO* anything about it are the ones making it about ""identity"" rather than the disparate ways our society treats people who look different from the ""norm."" 

It is a fact that lack of parental leave is detrimental to our society. It is a fiction of the Right that this is a ""women's"" issue that is primarily playing identity politics. 

It is a fact that our country's inability to figure out how to do anything about immigration is harder on some of our citizens than it is on (for instance) me. Sanders was absolutely, completely 100% wrong when he accused Latinos of voting based on ""color"" rather than what would help their families. When you are in danger of having your mother deported, that is the thing that most affects your family. We can all disagree on the family's level of culpability in getting into a situation where one spouse may have undocumented status when the children are citizens. Personally, I think we're in this mess because of our unwillingness to let enough people come legally, but I can understand the arguments. But it's an entirely different thing to accuse those children of voting on ""color,"" and the accusation is, quite frankly, kind of gross.

"'Politician uses political means to accomplish a political goal.' What a monster. They view the future of the GOP differently. These guys, along with Paul Ryan and maybe Rand Paul, represent the biggest threat to that movement. Super PACs are used to shape political parties and their platforms, and it seems that would be a fair characterization of Trump's move here.

People would attack Hillary for funding a Super PAC to end Sanders' career, but I don't think it's a particularly good comparison because their views have been more aligned than the Republicans' during primary season. At least, that is the way it has seemed (because Sanders' movement was so strong that Hillary couldn't afford to ostracize them). 

 People calling for aspects of socialism to be added to the Democratic platform, in my mind, is enough that the Democrats *should* be incentivized to dampen his message over the next 4-8 years, I just don't think Hillary can afford to do that until after she has won an election. She would need to live up to her promises and prove her practicability before Sanders' supporters, *en masse*, would become more open to the idea of voting for *her* platform (not a compromise) in 2020.

Yes, my pointing out your tantrums is me being horribly bent of shape.  I really worry that you would have a heart attack from someone actually being upset if you think a few completely bland comments were signs of someone being horribly bent out of shape.

"Education: Hillary has a plan to offer free tuition to state colleges for families earning less than $125,000 per year.  Trump doesn't.

Health care: Hillary has a long record of fighting for expanded health insurance and supports Obamacare.  Trump doesn't and his only policy pronouncement on health care is to allow competition among insurance companies across state borders.

National Debt: Hillary has a plan that is costed.  Trump's tax plan has been criticized for adding trillions to the national deficit and debt.

Getting Money Out of Politics: If you think Donald Trump will overturn Citizens United, then you haven't see his proposed U.S. Supreme Court nominees.

Climate Change: Donald Trump says it is a hoax.

Ending the Status Quo: Not sure what this means Donald Trump represents the preservation of the establishment.  He has bragged about using his wealth and influence to change policies that benefit him and other wealthy Americans.

Institutional racism: Trump is a racist.  Hillary has fought against racism.

Fair economy: Based on media reports (since voters have no access to his tax returns) Trump has not paid any federal taxes while ordinary working Americans can't just ignore the IRS.  If that is his approach to tax policy, how can he pretend to want to build a fair economy?

More jobs: [Hillary's plan will create 10 million jobs](http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/29/news/economy/hillary-clinton-economy-jobs-moodys/) while [Trump's plan will result in almost 4 million job losses over the same period](http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/21/news/economy/donald-trump-economy-jobs/).

Ending wars: [Trump has publicly mused about using nuclear weapons](https://thinkprogress.org/9-terrifying-things-donald-trump-has-publicly-said-about-nuclear-weapons-99f6290bc32a).

Third, they know what little there is of Trump's economic policy and they've compared it to Hillary's. Trump's sole detailed policy proposals are a 20% tax cut and a 40% tariff. Great. Or not so great. You can't really tell since that's all he has. It shows a lack of preparedness and a lack of being able to get things done. You don't know what it will do to the economy. Which means you don't know if your money will survive it. And the alternative? Yes, Hillary is gonna seriously raise taxes on the rich. But only on the super, super, super rich like CEO's and such. All the other rich people (making $200,000-1M) are still gonna be taxed higher, but not to the point of poverty. In short, the very rich will still be very rich, just not *as* rich. And on top of that, that money is being used to strengthen and stabilize the economy so that everybody can be richer. It sounds like a utopia, but that's what her plans call for.

"People think she was groomed by the Democratic party to become president. That comes from a lot of different places. People are distrustful of government and when they are told who the next nominee should be 6 years before the election then it sends the message that the decision has been made for them. So when people think she's entitled it's probably because of that.

I just don't like crying sexism at everything when sometimes it's easy to see other reasons. I'm not saying they're right, but I definitely don't think it's all sexism like others are suggesting. ",hillaryclinton,0

Weld at least used to be decently well spoken, and I'm certain he knows where Aleppo is, and can name a major world leader he admires.  He can coherently explain his political beliefs and positions without sounding like the stoners I used to know I'm high school.  The libertarians could've had a decent shot at getting Perot-level support this election if they'd put Weld in the presidential spot.  Gary is a friggin joke lol. ",hillaryclinton,0

"On the working class -

Hillary spent years working on poverty issues in Arkansas, as First Lady, and Senator. On the flipside, Trump has never dealt with or cared about people who are struggling. 

Part of the reason to trust her on the big issues is that she has been pretty consistent. She's been pro expanding healthcare coverage for over 25 years for example. If you are a solid Democrat and care about progressive things, her platform and issues are the most progressive of any Democrat running for President ever, including Obama.

Instead of trying to BS you on the email issue, I'm going to admit that I don't like it either. However, the most likely thing is that she wanted a separate server to communicate personal things and didn't care about the technical details of how. She is not the first person to have done this in government. She probably won't be the last. I'm in elected government myself, on a very small level, and we use our personal emails. It's just how things work.

But, despite all of the outrage from Republicans about The Clinton Foundation (which has an A rating from Charity Watch and does really good work around the world), there is no evidence that people donated to the Foundation and then she did them a real favor. No example at all. No matter how it looks, there are no examples of anyone being harmed from her actions or that she engaged in actual quid pro quo corruption. 

On the flip side, as a positive, Hillary knows how to get things done. She brough foreign leaders to the table as Secretary of State and negotiated treaties and deals that help curb the spread of nuclear weapons, protect the climate, and go after terrorists. She understands how government works and how to make actual deals. Will she compromise? Yes, and I hope she does, because she'll find answers as opposed to just talking big. 

If you want perfection, not only will you not get that with Hillary, you won't get that with anybody. If you want someone who will get shit done and listen to people, you'll find no better than Hillary Clinton. ",hillaryclinton,0
