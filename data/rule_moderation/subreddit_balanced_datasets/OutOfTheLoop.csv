"Ghostbusters was very controversial. This could be exempified by them supporting Hillary Clinton in a tweet which pretty much eliminates the idea that 'all-female' ghostbusters wasn't politically motivated. The cast and director had said some horrible things and leslie jones was no exception - however, a lot of these things were in response to attacks on her. 

Leslie Jones had made [some tweets in the past...](https://i.sli.mg/Kcu5df.jpg) Milo Yiannopoulos, who works for Breitbart, posted a compilation of her worse tweets, starting a fued. You can see some of the conversation [here](https://abload.de/img/nerointeractionslesli60u03.png).

After this the insults only seemed to increase (possibly as a result of Milo's twitter following). Leslie Jones then seemed to have a mental breakdown and started posting [porn](https://twitter.com/Lesdoggg/status/755133274591260672) and generally weird [stuff](https://i.imgur.com/vrr7BUO.jpg), until she 'took a break' from twitter.

Milo got banned from twitter. ]This wasn't the first time he had a run in with them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/40hezk/who_is_milo_yiannopoulis_and_what_is_going_on/). A lot of conservatives campaigned for reinstatement.

This is certainly not the first time twitter has been accused of censorship, the most notable instance being when they introuduced the ""Trust and Safety Council"", of which Anita Sarkesian's nigh-fraudulent Feminist Frequency and the ADL are members.

Recently Leslie Jones' website has been hacked, her details and nude pictures have been leaked.

A lot of the information about exactly who and what's being demonetized is still coming to light, but essentially many YouTubers being effected by it are considering it an attack on their livelihoods.  If your YouTube career is reporting news like PhilipDeFranco then you have a problem when most news can be considered controversial.  Many individuals have built a career on YouTube going against SJW's and those people seem to be getting hit pretty hard.  Karen Straughan for example is saying she's lost half her add revenue.  She's an Men's Rights Activist who spends a great deal of her time on YouTube Advocating for Mens rights and countering Feminist myths.

Contrary to the above poster, I'm hardly a fan of the US involvement in the conflict, either. The US, skittish about involvement in the Middle East after the Iraq debacle, was slow to get involved in the conflict in any capacity. When they did, they decided to arm opposition on the ground as opposed to direct intervention via ground forces. This was terribly reminiscent of the US arming opposition groups in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which didn't have great results, either. Rebel groups have been nearly impossible to vet, and no central command structure rose up to coordinate and lead the opposition. Wahhabist groups probably have gotten their hands on US arms. Despite anti-Assad forces making gains earlier in the war, since Russian intervention, US efforts to aid rebels in the region and thus force a diplomatic resolution to the conflict have been grossly ineffective.",OutOfTheLoop,0

"doubtful. I can only tell you what I witnessed- preface, he IS doing much better now, which i hate admitting, because I know it's based in scientologist bullshit. I'm fairly certain him going to any other rehab would have given the same result. in the end what he needed, and what he got, was to be totally cut off from any source of dope, and time. i firmly believe that, if you actually want to quit, in the end that's all you really need. if someone is hooked on dope they get from their hometown, send them 13 states away with no dope market and make them stay there for a year, and you bet that person will be clean, and after a year of sobriety the craving will be much less pronounced and their brain telling them they need the drug daily to function will slowly dissipate. complete the process by having them relocate to another area to re-start their life, again making it impractical for them to go back to their old hookups, and once they get back in the swing of having a life, addiction won't be a serious issue. keeping them in the same location is just asking for a relapse; the easiest way to prevent relapse is making it physically impossible for them to access it. anyways

his daily regimen consisted of multiple, hour+ sitting sessions in saunas and extremely high doses of niacin. this is not healthy. the counseling sessions consisted, basically, of the tenet of scientology where they use a sort of ""exposure"" therapy, i guess you could call it, to bombard the person's psyche with negative ideas until those negative ideas no longer cause a physiological or mental reaction; which i think could have some merit to it. non-drug rehab methods include, for example, calling someone who is incredibly sensitive about their intelligence an idiot and a moron, etc, until those words no longer trigger a negative response within the individual, thus curing the person of his/her insecurity.

HOWEVER, in the narconon environment, this instead became exercises in tedium. he would sit one-on-one with a counselor, who typically was just a previous patient who ""graduated"" out of the program. he would get asked a variety of questions, depending on the session, and would be required to answer it the same way, over and over and over again. the ashtray communication example i made was no joke. he had to stand in front of an ashtray (which is odd, because he wasn't addicted to nicotine) and say ""hello"" to it, i believe, over and over. for hours. over days, weeks, until the counselor guy felt that he had passed and moved him up to the next phase. another example would be, in a one-on-one session, being asked why he was there. ""to get clean."" why are you here? ""to get clean."" why are you here? ""to get clean."" again, for hours, days, weeks, until the next step. who knows what makes the person running that goofy shit decide that he's ""figured it out"" and ""graduated"" to the next step, however.

there were little workbooks that looked like middle school coloring books, construction-paper quality pages and everything, that basically educated them on the process, why and how it works, which he would have to learn and complete, again, to move to the next phase or step. i believe there were 4 workbooks in total he had to finish for about a 6 month stay. around this time they would stop the niacin and sauna treatments as that was mainly used for the ""detoxification"" phase. keep in mind that niacin does not detoxify the body and can actually cause pretty uncomfortable side effects.

after about four months he got to come home for a visit, which is where he shared with me the workbooks and told me about his experience so far. before that he could not have any outside contact, including any contact with family. at this point he was still relatively certain that scientology was a bunch of crazy bullshit (or at least nodded in agreement with me when i went about espousing how nuts scientology and scientologists are and their core insane beliefs), but he said ""some of the stuff makes sense."" cue my shock and worry. the plan basically was roughly $30K for the inpatient treatment, where he would get fed pretty well by a chef and could stay as long as he wanted within reason until he felt rehabilitated- this is why his mom went the narconon route- she didn't know it was run by scientologists, at first, and $30K for a stay-as-long-as-you-need program was far and away cheaper than say, $50K for a 3-month-and-you're-out competing inpatient program.

when he finally got out, he said his plans were to go back and become a counselor there. they would pay him pretty modestly and allow him to stay there. he was clean, but his thought process had become twisted, and he wasn't the guy i knew during his addiction nor was he the guy that he used to be before the addiction. i stopped talking to him at this point, which is too bad, because we had been close friends since elementary school.

from what i gather now, he moved to a different city, did NOT become a counselor, and i'm assuming is still clean. he works out a LOT and is ripped now, but he worked out a ton a few years back when he moved by himself 3 hours away to go to tech school, so from what i can see from the very little i've encountered, he's rejected the scientology shit and is basically back to where he was post-high school, pre-addiction. so good for him. i'm almost positive he still smokes pot and drinks way too much but that's always been the way he rolls, even before the addiction.

so there you have it, that's what i know about narconon from a second-hand perspective and first-hand experience thumbing through the workbooks.",OutOfTheLoop,0

Florida Man is that same thing, and comes from titles that fit the structure ""Florida man found naked stuck up 20 foot pole.""

Under the Constitution, federal officers including judges must be confirmed by the Senate, currently controlled by the GOP. They have refused to schedule confirmation hearings, much less a vote. Senate leader Mitch McConnell said that it would be improper to confirm a justice in an election year without giving the people an opportunity to weigh in (via the presidential election), although at the time of Justice Scalia's death, the president had more than 11 months left of his term. (Justices have been vetted and approved in election years before, and in much less time.) A few Republican senators have informally met with Garland, as is typical, but only very few, which is not. As long as the Senate doesn't act, there's nothing that can be done.

If you're quite stuck on the biological species concept then, bless, but generally people are looking at bit deeper than that these days and what makes a species a species is determined at a molecular genetics level. Either way, for consistency's sake, it makes sense to either just make note of the agreed-upon genera or the species, but specifying chimpanzees and bonobos as separate but gorillas/orangutangs as not is a little silly (as you noticed). For whatever reason, my guess is because people drum up the uniqueness of the bonobo (and because it's no longer called the dwarf chimpanzee), you're not the first person I've seen to make the same mistake. As to whether E/W gorillas interbreed, I did a very shallow search of the literature and didn't see anything on the topic, but keep in mind that they are more likely to be limited by social behaviour/environment/location than they are by biology.",OutOfTheLoop,0

To that end, the west differentiates between the moderate, anti-Assad rebels and the Islamic extremist rebels, while Russia does not.

Not going to get into the validity of either viewpoint, but Russian airstrikes seem to be selectively targeting anti-Assad rebels over Islamist rebels. It has been reported that over [90%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/07/russia-airstrikes-syria-not-targetting-isis) of Russian airstrikes have not targeted ISIS, and have instead targeted US-backed moderate opponents of the Assad regime, which has strengthened his position, allowed him to maintain power, and further exacerbated the conflict.

"A few studios make scenes where the actors somehow explicitly make it clear that they are blood related (it's kinda hard to organically work a statement like ""we're blood related, not step-relatives"" into dialogue without having it look silly and shoehorned in).

More frequently, an incest porn scene will mention a family relationship but not state explicitly either way whether this means step or blood. The viewer can infer what they will.

Most frequently, incest porn scenes will explicitly make it clear somehow that the two characters are only step-relatives and not blood related. This is what pretty much all mainstream sites (Brazzers, Digital Playground, Wicked, Naughty America, etc) do. The reason for this is that the porn industry already has a shady public image and uneasy relationship with government regulators. Obscenity laws vary by state and tend to be pretty vague, so the major porn studios (who have a lot to lose) don't want to push the envelope too much by making the incest fantasy explicit. ""Step"" is something of a legal shield they can fall back on if the Powers That Be start freaking out. I mean if push really came to shove and the production of non-step incest porn actually went to court, there's a good chance it would be ruled legal since it's explicitly fictional and everyone is over 18.

"Pepe (and wojak) have been an enduring meme on 4chan and sometimes other places. There have been countless drawings of him doing things, for many years now. Pepe has a smug, dominating, bullying, trickster style personality. 

There's also a version of PePe that's always sad, usually on r9k, which was once called ""Sad Frog"". Haven't seen that one around in a while.

Wojak, the bald white guy, is often the victim of Pepe's bullying.

Trump fans also made their own edits, making ""Trump Frogs"" and whatnot, with Wojak sometimes being his victim or being Hillary. Such as a Pepe Trump building a wall and Wojak being on the other side as a Mexican. 

Since Trump's fans have a lot of social media clout, usually with non-personal Twitter accounts, they started posting their Trump Pepe edits in Twitter replies and other images. At some point, either Trumps twitter itself or some other bigshots retweeted some of the Pepe edits, exposing them to the surface world.
