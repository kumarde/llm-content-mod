"Most of my friends are girls and I'm a straight dude.

My ex-girlfriends have never been vocal with an issue over it, though I do sometimes leave out details like if they stay over (I live in my city's centre and taxis be more expensive than a bus) they'll stay in the same bed etc. because it's just easier that way.

IDK, I just get on easier with girls than guys (I hate the whole lad culture) and I've been upfront about this in the early stages of any relationship. Guess it's like you know what you're getting into early.

Biggest problem is 

1. Their jealous boyfriends, normally I just befriend them and if they're a gym fiend then my skinny ass ain't a perceived threat 

2. Getting them to stop hanging out with a girl after I break up with them

3. Friends leaving stuff at my flat and girlfriends thinking its been left by a girl I am fucking with, though that only happens once or twice before they get used it.

I find girls to be much better wingbuddies and much better at advice (dating, clothes, financial, cologne) than guys though, no doubt.",BlackPeopleTwitter,1

"> There are always exceptions. I probably had more privilege than some whites

So here's a reason that I would argue calling something ""white privilege"" is stupid and harmful.  As it would turn out, not all white people are advantaged over other races, even in America.  Perhaps you could generalize that there is a higher proportion of white people who live ""privileged"" lifestyles compared to black people, but then why not just call it ""upper class privilege""?  The main difference between rich white kids and rich black kids who grew up in Beverly Hills is one group can say nigga when singing along to rap songs and one can't.

Another point I have is, would you consider ""black privilege"" a thing in black neighborhoods in some cities?  Are black people ""privileged"" compared to white people in 95% black highschools in parts of Chicago?  I guarantee you white kids are mistreated in a lot of these kinds of places, but we don't speak of any sort of ""privilege"" heirarchy because its taboo (you probably can guess why).

White privilege makes it blatantly obvious that it refers to ones race, and implies that someone is to blame for a certain injustice that is perceived.  But race actually hardly plays a part in this when you compare the lifestyles of upper class black people and upper class white people.  So instead of us further pushing a wedge in the divide between whites and blacks like we've done wonderfully so in the past 10 years, how about we try to stick together a bit?",BlackPeopleTwitter,1

"Wow, tears of sadness because blue-collar America didn't get behind your corporate backed politician, the same corporations that have been sending jobs overseas for the last 30 years.  Instead of giving reasons as to why people should vote for her, her campaign devolved into nothing but ""my opposition is Trump"" and to vote against him.  All the while, you delve into the race card.

I voted third-party (Johnson), but had Sanders been the nominee, which he should have been, I would have gladly stood in line to cast my vote for him.  Instead, I got the establishment personified because the DNC and corporate media put Sanders into a hole, and now that Clinton has lost, I see the delving into racist stereotypes as to why people didn't vote en masse for Clinton.

A Trump presidency will be a disaster, but I can't help but smile when I read shit like this because I realize that people like you still don't get it. Nothing but pure idiocy in this post.

When he went to his car he had his hands concealed in it. That is a big no no. Never hide your hands. They don't know what he's reaching for in it. He could have been reaching for a gun, he could have been reaching for a snickers. The police don't know. But when you're asked to show your hands and you don't show them, expect to be taken down. Tazing was the right thing. They had to get his hands out and he was not acting like a sane person. Unfortunately, the lady cop got scared and shot him. Not excusable. A competent cop would have kept their firearm drawn and kept their finger off the trigger until an appropriate threat was shown. Like an actual gun, which was not what happened.

1. BLM started after the boiling point in black society in America was met. It had nothing to do with Latinos,  Asians, or Filipinos simply because the cases and things brought to public eye were between Black and White Americans. It's the same reason for the Civil Rights being predominantely remembered as a Black Rights movement, most not realizing it caused the  feminist movement.

2. A lot of black citizens are coming to realize and outwardly state the prejudice we as blacks face in America. Implicit Biases, racial prejudices and quite literally, institutionalized and internalized racism still exist today. However this is no longer due to just hatred, but rarher an ignorance on the behalf of the majority (whites). Aka, we woke.

3. All Lives Matter was started specifically to discredit and disenfranchise BLM (thats a reoccuring theme in the US btw). It wasnt some sort of patriotic idea like many romanticize. It was blatantly made to combat the ideas of BLM. Which of course caused more tension between the camps. Thats why theres so much salt and pepper between the two.

Now personally, I pay attention to most of shootings by police because thats a problem we as anpeople face regardless of race. But the reason why the spotlight is on BLM is cause of a) the history of Blacks and Whites is MUCH more important to American History than any other races and also because its the easiest to monetize.

"There's a whole subreddit devoted to people who blame their parents entirely for everything that's ever gone wrong in their lives. It really is a phenomenal escape from responsibility. It's also one that a lot of people tend to propagate online because it's easy to help someone ""remember"" something from their childhood that caused their current issue and then the individual doling out advice sounds knowledgeable.  
  
 For example: If someone was saying they have issues with trust in relationships and always doubt the integrity of their boyfriends and you were to say, ""was your father around when you were younger?"" and they answer that he was not, then you've got something to explain abandonment issues. If they say that he was, and you follow up with, ""when you were younger, maybe in your formative years, do you remember your father ever forgetting to pick you up somewhere or getting lost in a public place and being afraid?"" or some other thing that every kid ever has experienced and then suddenly you've given them the ability to form that connection on their own which makes you sound like a genius who totally gets them... and now any time that person thinks of some personality flaw they have they'll look back and either remember or fabricated some explanation related to their childhood, entirely giving up their ability to change or improve because they've passed responsibility off to someone else.",BlackPeopleTwitter,0

I worked random jobs until one day I stumbled upon selling online which was really fun and I did that for awhile until I found a job with a company selling on ebay. 

After 2 years there,  I had learned how to do a lot of things like customer service,  SEO, sales, and many other things as it was a small business so we had to be a jack of all trades type. It  made me realize I had an interest in business when I've been pursuing STEM jobs for years.  Now I'm back in college to get an accounting degree and studying  for my CPA. 

I guess my point is just go where life takes you.  No point in going to college until you really know what you want there.

"I remember awhile back (4 or 5 years ago) right before that horrible WZRD album came out, that Cudi stopped smoking weed. I believe he went completely sober at the time. Ever since than he's been getting crazier. Which leads me to believe that he has an undiagnosed mental illness.(mental illness doesnt not equate to crazy) Many people (me including) enjoyed marijuana immensely because being high helped them relax, ease anxiety, think clearly, etc. When you stop getting high, the defects become more apparent because you dont have that calming element.

I feel like that would greatly reduce the us vs. them (or, Black vs. White) mentality, and would also be able to kill 2 birds with 1 stone by bringing a more powerful and diverse set of ideals to the table.",BlackPeopleTwitter,0
