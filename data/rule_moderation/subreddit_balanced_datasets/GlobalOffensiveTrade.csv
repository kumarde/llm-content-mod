"well,i dont know about prices on some other Real Cash sites,but i know on lounge and here. And my thought is this:

1.  You can put the price whatever the fuck you want. Now if someone buys howl 0.15 for 400 keys and not on some Real Cash site for 250,that is his fucking problem. You have google,you have reddit,you have internet that is full of this informations.

2. Real Cash is Real Cash,and Items are Items. Now if you can get somewhere cheaper for Real Cash then from that guy for 400 keys  then go and get it. Oh wait,you cant cause you have items and not real cash. Now you need to invest 5-7 days to sell your items on normal prices so you may be able to get enough to buy on those cash sites. 

Now i can not say that those key prices for some items are not funny,but yet i still cant say that they have no reason for it. 

there are people who have full inventorys in items like black pearls,rubys,howl,sapphires for which they have invested Major cash to buy them. Now they own market on those and they can to whatever the fuck they want about it. 

he has it,you want it. Now if you want it,you pay for it. Thats that.

PS,dont blame me here for supporting maniulators or something cuz im not. Im just here to say my though how all that works logically. Now cause its not morall thats other stuff :)

"As many said, DONT get scammed, DONT get sharked. Ask someone you trust and does a lot of trading for advice maybe. PPL will know your not familiar with all the jazz when you try to sell it. It is worth a HELL LOT, lucky guy, but as many stated, get rid ASAP, lore is a new skin, it will drop in price as more lores get onto the market. Maybe selling it on OP-Skins wouldn't bet the absolute worst thing to do. You might not get maximum pay, but you get $$ and you wont get scammed for 100% which alone in itself is quite a big advantage.
