38 year old, washed up ex-sluts are a terrible influence on other women. They have nothing to lose, so they slut it up with abandon. They are unable to maintain relationships with men, so they hate men with abandon. Younger, untainted women are, unfortunately, easily influenced by watching these old sluts in action.

If the sluts just go and die off, far away from the cock carousel, they won't be able to set a terrible example for all other women. More importantly, they won't be exploiting beta males for their resources in exchange for tepid infrequent sex.

It's a win win.

Ha, any man can pay women for sex! /u/WorldsEndGirlfriend is right on point about your delusions of success with women!

"Today I saw this [article](http://www.bustle.com/articles/159136-why-women-are-attracted-to-risk-takers-for-casual-flings) on Bustle, from a sex-positive feminist author, about which guys women prefer for a casual fling, which unlike most things on Bustle, I found quite interesting. And the reason why is because it's content, if it came from anywhere else, would not doubt be derided rapidly.

>As much as we love to throw around the old anecdote about how men think with their penises, women are guilty of thinking about what gets them sexually excited too — when it comes to short-term love affairs. They’re not looking past living in the moment, so someone who takes risks is more attractive than the person who plays it safe.

>“Women, especially younger women, are turned on more by the ‘cool guy,’” Alexander tells Bustle. “The ‘cool guy’ is the player type, the one who all the girls want to date, the one who is unattainable.” And, if I'm to be honest, usually the unattainable bad boy or girl is fleeting.

>“These cool guys typically have a devil-may-care attitude, thus they are more prone to being reckless in all areas of their life,"" says Alexander. ""They drink, they smoke, they may be careless about other behaviors as well. There is something primal about this.

>According to Alexander, this need to be excited by the bad boy is more likely to be founder in younger women. For them, the nice guy is boring. “It's only after they get their hearts broken do they realize that this ‘cool guy’ is not all fun and games,” says Alexander.

>Men Might Actually Be Aware Of What Their Risky Behavior Is Doing

>Unlike women, when it comes looking for a short-term partner, men couldn’t care less if a woman indulges in risky behavior or not. ""They like the cool girl, too, but for them the cool girl is the one who is confident and self-assured,” says Alexander.

So, according to this author, women want to have sex with risque, unattainable bad boys, who have a reckless, careless attitude, who need to break their hearts after having sex with them, before women switch a type as they grow older, they find nice guys boring, and men are aware of that tendency in women, purposefully faking it just for them, even if they aren't like this naturally. To top it all, men themselves do not share that same mindset with women.

Even without rephrasing anything into more ""blunt"" terms or manospherian slang, all of the conclusions in this article look as if they could come directly from an hardcore Redpiller, or any angry incel, where they would've been immediately ridiculed as delusional, bitter, misogynistic ""NiceGuy"" myths.

You think so because you live in a social environment permeated by feminist rape-culture propaganda. 

Rape isn't undesired sex. It's unconsensual sex. 

Feminists started this confusion by assuming that women consent to sex when they desire it, and don't when they don't. They then treated these two things as the same. 

But women frequently consent to sex they don't desire, and desire sex they don't consent to... the same way that you might go to work on monday morning even though you don't want to, and really want that piece of cheesecake which you're not going to eat, because you're too fat already. 

Women are often quite okay with not being given a choice about sex, so long as they like the man, and the sex. 

And some women *want* to not be given a choice. This is what ""rape fetish"" is about, and go read some romance novels if you don't think there are a *lot* of women turned on by that.

I am not doing your hw for you, again. You are perfectly capable of googling it yourself and I even told you what to google.

The point is, that even without that research it's obvious that psychology is not a science because it doesn't meet other criteria as well.   

Once again - read about things I mentioned. Theories must meet the criteria that I listed multiple times. Go ahead and try to show how psychology is, for example, falsifiable. It's just not.

No, my OP clearly states what the point of the CMV is. The point of the CMV is to show how catcalling is not objectively immoral, so feminists should stop imposing their morals on me by telling me to not do it. The point of the CMV is to show how feminists are hypocrites for saying that I'm responsible for other men who catcall, but that women aren't responsible for other women that respond positively to catcalling.  The point of the CMV is that I am not responsible for the actions of other people, and I am not to blame for choosing to stay out of it.

So because something is common it lacks value? This is an absurd point to try and argue. Everyone has a life but I certainly wouldn't say because my life is common it has no value. Also regarding what they achieve, emotions achieve everything. There is nothing that great that has been done that wasn't an emotional labour. All the great discoveries and inventions have been pursuits of passion and emotion.

This is possibly the closest thing to actual true statement you said, and only accidentally, for all the wrong reasons.

Just because people hurt themselves abusing something doesn't make that something inherently bad.

You see, this is the problem. Women have never had to fight for what they have. They have always been given everything. They were given their security, they were given their rights, they are given their assets which make them attractive in the sexual market. They don't know what it is to fight for something, and this has caused them to have such a skewed outlook of the world. 

What women don't realise is, no man wanted to like the Beatles, no man wanted to wear flowery shirts, or have a manufactured and polished looked. No man wants to talk about their emotions, we don't want to bitch and moan and whine the way women do. In order to get a man to do any of that, you have to give him a reason. And that reason is that it would increase his chances to reproduce.

Imagine a world where every man is indifferent to having children and indifferent to having sex. They're just ""meh, I don't really want kids or sex"" and you, as a female, want to have children. Well, you would have to fight to convince a men to have children, you would have to fight to make the man want to have sex with you. What are you going to do? Well, you are going to find out what men like, and do it. If they like women who cook and clean, than you are going to cook and clean in order to make him want you. If they want women who are fat, than you are going to get fat in order to make him want you.

"Have you even ever gotten a blowjob? Because that screams blowjob-virgin, or you are the most boring person to give blowjobs to. 

Women certainly do check up on you periodically if you still enjoy it.

Even if you just stop moaning and don't move your hips rhythmically anymore for a while they will ask if they are doing everything correctly or they will look you into your eyes and ask it with their body language. They would certainly notice it if you would freeze up and would ask what's wrong. There's a constant communication going on non-verbally so that you don't have to ask all the time, but dirty talk is sexy so we also do that. 

But even though your post sounds logically sound you are still purposely moving the goal post to put a bad light on women and to make them look like children. 

The whole debate started with women that freeze up due to their brains rape instinct triggering. It's ""fight or flight"", but you are holding them down so they can't flee and they are much weaker so they can't fight. Thus their brain chooses to save them by freezing up.

Just like a deer that looks into the headlights of a car would rather scream, fight or run away, but they just can't. The deer doesn't consent to getting run over just because it's incapable of jumping away.

It's not that women are weak little children that can't even speak up when they don't enjoy the sex. It's that sometimes people freeze up during sex and TRPers use this as propaganda against women.

>if they are too afraid to speak up and communicate in a consensual sexual encounter about something they don't like, they shouldn't be having sex

IF girls didn't have all this attention they would be very different and maybe these guys would have some chance of a better deal.

"You pass judgment on it so that you understand the true reasons why you were rejected.  There's nothing weird about wanting to understand that.  

A woman doesn't need a ""good reason"" for rejecting a stranger, nor any reason at all.  But the man being rejected DOES need to understand WHY he was rejected.  Since he will never get an honest answer about that from her, he needs to surmise it for himself. 

This whole

&gt;""Don't you see how weird it is that a stranger should need a good reason for rejecting another stranger?""

is a copout too.  It's creep shaming.  A guy wants to know why he was rejected, and he has to figure it out for himself.   He's not asking you to do anything.  It's not weird or odd or strange for a man to want to know why, without asking you to divulge anything.   If you don't want to divulge anything (which is your right), then don't get all pissy because a guy is passing judgment on you. 

Finally -- this all comes back to the fact that women don't want to admit the real reason they reject Nice Guys, which is that they aren't attracted to them.  But women don't want to say this, because it makes them look shallow and superficial.   Frankly, most Nice Guys would prefer you acted shallow and superficial and stated the real reasons for the rejection, I think. ",PurplePillDebate,0

A lot of the less attractive couples I know met through friends or in some ""warm"" situation where they were introduced, and it doesn't surprise me because it's usually the hot people who are confident just walking up to someone else and saying hi.

Put another way: If a fb behaved in a way that earned my respect and made me think they were superior, then I'd be fine with that. Hasn't happened though, probably won't. You can't just claim superiority, you have to actually be superior. Same with respect, it's earned, given - not taken. But almost all women don't understand that in any way.

"&gt; and I worry that will add to the number of folks that can't find gainful employment in the not-so-distant-future.

There's a certain number of what one might call ""unemployed positions"" in todays' developed economies that exist simply because of the system and not because of the individual pathologies of some of the unemployed. The high numbers of college graduates who have trouble getting jobs are another aspect to this. Simply putting more resources in to education does not increase the number of jobs anywhere but in the education sector.

Of course once one is unemployed the whole situation is rather damaging. 

If the poor did not breed and the rich bred unrestrainedly I doubt the overall unemployment rate would be hugely different... there would be some buying of jobs for kids but there would also still be many people unemployed. It is very like homelessness, the natural number of homeless and unemployed (ie those who can not sustain employment/housing even under favorable conditions) is much lower than the actual rate under current conditions.

Another thing to note, there have been many many historical  instances of large numbers of previously poor people, many poor for generations,  flourishing once given better economic circumstances with more opportunities. The reason it is so hard to raise the poor up within our society is because the only way to do it is to change society, and that's just too difficult and there are too many people doing well out of the current system.

Who taught you English?

You and the slutwalkers are making a hilarious error based on lack of familiarity with the English language.

So imagine a guy called Steve. He's a skater and he likes to try moves that are beyond his ability. Steve watches an elite guy do an awesome trick and tries to copy it. He faceplants and bangs his face up. Somebody says ""Steve was asking for it"". 

In English, when we say ""Steve was asking for it"" that usually is a figure of speech which does not mean what it literally appears. Steve wasn't literally requesting something. 

It means ""Steve was behaving in a careless manner and was reckless to the high risks involved. It worked out badly for Steve.""

When a person says a woman who got raped in a high-risk, high-crime area of town, ""was asking for it"", the phrase means ""she was behaving in a careless manner and was reckless to the high risks involved. It worked out badly for her"".

In all cases, the speaker places the primary blame on the rapist, but hopes that her unfortunate fate will serve as an example to other people to take care where they go after sundown.",PurplePillDebate,0

"It's s difficult question to answer.

Parts of it is simply taking women off of the pedestal and holding women to the same standard as men.  As I've stated, in our fem centric world, this is categorized as abusive.  If a woman isn't worshipped, she is abused.  So, no, I don't label those things as abuse.

As for dread levels 6+, absolutely I believe this crosses the line into abuse.  You're basically terrorizing the woman into doing what you want out of fear.  TRP has this twisted notion that you're just showing her you have options, and women are attracted to a man that has options.  Which, fine if women really respond to that, but passive dread communicates that 100x better than active dread and isn't abusive.

I don't think negging necessarily crosses the line into abuse.  It's kind of a dick thing to do, but, high value men can do all kinds of dick things and women eat it up for some reason.  A low value man just comes across as whiny and socially inept.

The average western woman is promiscuous. It's normal to expect sex on the 3rd date, because of how promiscuous our society is. Our celebrities are promiscuous and could only be accepted by a promiscuous society.

"When it comes to victim blaming, reasonable is a hard line to define. What may seem unreasonable to you may be reasonable to someone else.

Advocating for safe alcohol consumption isn't necessarily victim blaming, especially since people can overdose or get alcohol poisoning. It just seems that, as women, they have to be extra cautious in life because they will essentially be targets for the sole fact that they are women. So reasonable consumption might help, sure. But what is it about being women that makes them easier targets? And when you look at it that way, you have to look at the side of the rapist and how to prevent attitudes where it's ok to rape someone.

In regards to some of the questions, I don't know, because I don't know all the situations. With Brock Turner's victim, if she was a man, would have she gotten raped? Same alcohol consumption, same everything, but would she have gotten raped if she was a man? 

This also ignores that women do tend to take a lot of precautions, but nobody is perfect. Especially young people, when it comes to alcohol, drugs or even behaviours that might be a tad dangerous. 

In the abuse thing, my point is, people could be forced to take something through threats of violence and people will still find a way to ask, how it could have been different.

This argument was brought up on the Cognitive Dissonance podcast, where they went to the Black Lives Matter website to see what their actual beliefs and statements are. Unlike religion where you have a mixed bag of kill people and don't kill people and people take what they want, with Black Lives Matter, you have actual stated beliefs and goals. Also, the Southern Poverty Law centre for instance has listed Black power movements as hate groups, and black power doesn't seem to be on the list of Black Lives Matter things.

"&gt;&gt;Yeah rp wants a feminine woman.

&gt;I like how you ignore all of the other traits I listed that RP wants in a woman.  Wanting a feminine women in itself doesn't make it the 50's, it combine with the other traits does. 

Submissive, no ambition, not educated are feminine aspects.

Able to be controlled really means, a woman that will be loyal to her man, which is feminine.

Being a homemaker is a feminine perk.

It doesn't make it 50s.

The biggest difference now is gaining loyalty through other means because women being able to work and divorce and get help from the state makes them have less incentive to be loyal. 

However, women are more addicted to pleasure these days. So loyalty can be gained through good sex especially, but also food, drugs, fun.

That's probably the biggest difference, consumerism + working through capitalism, has changed how women behave and how they must be handled. 

&gt;&gt;It changes the landscape permanently.

&gt;It does.  That doesn't mean nor stop you from wanting to resort to the past.  I mean part of the reason RP are fed up with anger is because they know they can't control women like society use to anymore.  And women learned to not put up with such crap from men and more so they no longer have to depend on a man like they use to.  This upsets TRP.

Yeah, it makes it harder to invest in a woman and keep her loyal. It makes fighting hypergamy more difficult.

Essentially it requires men to be even better to keep her around, to keep her love.

In a strange way it's makes things harder for men requiring men to be better than they were before which is some benefit to men overall, even if it comes with unpleasant aspects, and less men being successful in general.

Its also why the plate strategy came about, stop trying to have a woman for a long time, have many for a short time and keep getting new ones because they can't be as well controlled.

Different landscape, we will never go back to the 50s, women can be independent too easily and too many are promiscuous, different behaviors, different tactics. 

&gt;&gt;I was honestly surprised by that.

&gt;I am not surprised at all.  It has nothing to do with money or corruption, it has to do with what I call the old guard which is old white guys making their last stand because they know they are on the way out.

"My take on TRP is exactly why it's called The Red Pill... that I was fed all the Disney lies since I was a child on how to treat women.  

Swallowing the red pill awakened me to the reality that women aren't special and shouldn't be placed on this magical pedestal.  That women actually don't go for the nice guy... they go for the hot guy.  That they are NOT sugar and spice and everything nice.

Now, you might be confused because I just said there aren't that many shitty women in the world.  Which is still true.  I don't believe that a woman acting the way women are hard wired to act makes them shitty people.  As much as feminists want to trumpet equality, the fact is that women and men are different on some very base levels.  

A woman that shit tests a man to test his frame is not being a shitty person.  She is doing what women do to evaluate a potential mate.  

Just as I would say a man that wants a lot of sex isn't a shitty man.  That's just how men are wired.  But in our fem-centric society, we have equated wanting lots of sex with shallowness and shittyness, because the female imperative is what we use as our baseline for acceptable behaviors.

I also am a big believer in looking inwards as to why you aren't getting laid.  I know most BPers think TRP blames women, but it's just not true.  The onus is on YOU to dress well, groom yourself, hit the gym, work on your personality/game, etc.  Stop crying and become the kind of man that women want to fuck!

Now, there are several areas in which I depart in canonical TRP thinking.  Women are the oldest teenager in the house is one of them.  I hate this phrase because I believe that the vast majority of women are holding the households together.  Men, for the most part, are lazy slobs that come home from work and expect the woman to do all the chores.  If that isn't the actions of a teenager, I don't know what is!

Yes, that's why they go to clubs to try and try to lock down Chad

&gt; If a girl is hooking up with dudes in a club, that really doesn't mean that she isn't open to relationships.

Yes, but she isn't open to relationships with her college guys, otherwise she'd have no reason to search Chad cock in clubs

I almost lost her a couple times, but eventually I managed to follow her home and then went back home to get some sleep. 

The following day (today actually), I confidently walked up to her door and knocked a few times. She opened the door and as soon as she saw it was me, she slammed the door shut and locked it. I figured she was the shy type of girl and so I confidently picked up a large rock, attached a note asking if she would go out with me, and threw it at her living room window in the most confident way possible. She didn't respond, being shy and all and wanting me to prove that I was confident enough for her, so I confidently climbed through her broken window and walked through the house to try and find her.

"&gt;Specifically, does getting to know a guy make you more horny for him?

Yes.

And I also enjoy the buildup of sexual tension that comes from the flirting period. I like to let that tension build for a while, and I think it makes sex (and the relationship, if one develops) better once it does happen.

&gt;Secondly, is the decision to put off sex because you find a guy interesting conscious or unconscious? Like do you actually feel like having sex initially, or is the desire not there at all?

Unconscious. I'm not thinking, ""This guy is hot, but I'd better not have sex with him yet."" I've literally never wanted to have sex within moments of meeting someone, ever. That's not something I can remotely relate to.

Also, like others have said, sex is risky for a woman. Aside from pregnancy risk, there's the fact that this person is much bigger and stronger than you. It shouldn't be hard to understand why you might want to put off being naked, vulnerable and alone with them until you know them a little better.

And because I know it's coming: yes, there are women who jump into bed with guys an hour after meeting them. I believe these women are by far the minority, and I can't say what their motivations are. Frankly, at the risk of being judgmental, I think they're pretty stupid.",PurplePillDebate,0

&gt;What does it mean when a woman(you), says that she needs to get to know a guy first before she wants to have sex? Like what changes in feelings or desires do you feel if you do this? Specifically, does getting to know a guy make you more horny for him?

Yes, for me anyway. Personality traits can make someone much more sexually attractive to me. Establishing the emotional bond will also develop sexual attraction in me. 

&gt;Secondly, is the decision to put off sex because you find a guy interesting conscious or unconscious? Like do you actually feel like having sex initially, or is the desire not there at all?

For me it's unconscious I think. There might be attraction to his physical appearance but it's not going to be anywhere near enough for me to have sex with him until I develop the emotional connection and get to know him.

She'd say, ""He was a guy I didn't care about"", even if she had plenty of resources to raise the baby on her own.  She doesn't want to spend years looking at a child who reminds her of a guy who dissed her, or whatever.  Even Darwin in his book ""Descent of Man"" mentioned that fairly common infanticide was a source of doubt for his human sexual selection theory.

I think what you're missing here is that the relationship advice advocated by TRP, MRP et al cuts too far into a woman's sphere of power than they would be willing to accept, provided they have other options. 

For example, I have no idea if my husband thinks me telling him to pick up his socks is a shit test. He can think that all he wants. Hell, he probably does think that half the time. The problem isn't his thoughts, those are invisible to me, the problem occurs when he doesn't pick up his socks. 

What these women fear, at worse, is that they'll meet a guy who will be normal in the beginning, and then ratchet up the dread when they are at their most vulnerable--say when they've quit their job or have young children, or have moved across the country. This is because much of the relationship advice on MRP, at its most extreme, mirrors what we consider abuse.

"You're still using the most extreme version of BB ever. 

&gt;He second choice or a back up for a woman that made a lot of ""bad choices"", most likely been plated by several Chads in her life, or she done having her fun with the Chad's and now offerring her used pussy to the BB at the price of a new pussy.

And she's not even second choice Chad. She's just one in a rotation of women, who are disposable and replaceable at will. He's at least second place and she's not disposing of him as she pleases. 

&gt;Yes he's most likely in a situation which has the potential of him being cheated on. Even when the BB finds out, he may forgive her and stay. Making him even more beta.

And she doesn't even get the *potential* to have sexual faithfulness or loyalty of *any* kind--sexual or otherwise. Again, just a plate to be replaced on a whim if he feels like it. 

&gt;He's most likely not only providing for her, but also her children which are not his. Cuckolding himself.

No no no. This isn't a fucking requirement for BB - why are you adding things?? 

&gt;The sex starts becoming less and less frequent. Most likely because of the second point. Truthfully you more sex with a woman that you're not commited to.

Statistically this is wrong. I made a [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/5453n1/cmv_being_in_a_committed_monogamous_relationship/) about this even. But yes, pure RP theory would say a *Chad* can get more frequently sex as a bachelor than in a relationship. You cannot say the same for a BB-type. 

&gt;Divorce, which is initiatedby women 70% of the time (go figure) that can potentially ruin him not only emotionally but financiallly as well which is worse.

Women do not initiate 70% of the time and whoever thinks they understand the divorce rate that simply is wildly incorrect. In fact the majority of things TRP says about divorce laws is wildly incorrect. That aside, yes I would admit (as I already have) that assuming BB is married - it's harder for him to leave than for a plate to. That is one difference we can agree upon. 

&gt;If divorced he will also feel that his time has been wasted because it has.

You think a plate feels like her time is fulfilled if she really wants a relationship?

&gt;As far as the plate is concerned, well at least she's desired. If only just for sex.

No, this is male solipsism. Lots of women do not feel ""desired"" by being fleshlights, how many times do we need to tell men this? Women do not feel desired/wanted by a man pumping and dumping either, we feel desired/wanted by a man wanting a relationship.",PurplePillDebate,0

&gt;Status doesn't change how attractive someone is? Wearing nice clothes and accessories doesn't change status? 

&gt;According to RP, no, men are not attracted to status.

Everyone is attracted to status, and beauty is a large part of a woman's status. 

&gt;Men only care about women's clothes insomuch as those clothes accentuate her feminine features (breasts, hip-to-waist ratio etc.) Men are not going to be more attracted to a woman because her clothes indicate status and wealth. At this point I'm not even playing devil's advocate to make a RP argument, this is just obvious.

Totally wrong. If I'm wealthy, I'm more attracted to a woman that's also wealthy because she likely has higher standards, comes from a better family, is a better woman, higher quality genetics, etc.

The woman with nice clothes and stuff either earned it herself, got it from her family, or from men. All of these indicate value.

Women project an image of being insecure and of having been hurt or used by boyfriends in their past because that allows them to gain more attention and validation. The only women in this world who are truthfully insecure are the women who were unluckly to have bad genetics and weight 150+ pounds.

Facts are real. But they aren't real when they aren't facts like in this situation.
