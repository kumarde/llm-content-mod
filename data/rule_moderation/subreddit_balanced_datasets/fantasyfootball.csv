So my options are to have faith in cobb who is 26 and I could keep as a third round pick for the next three years. Or I could go with Jordy who is 31 and costs a second round pick.

When I took over as commissioner this year the first thing I did was eliminated IR and shore up the benches. Dudes whined about it. 

I stated, it is my belief that every aspect of fantasy should be as competitive as possible and that no single day should dictate 16 weeks of play. Not a bad draft, not a bus crash where half your team dies and not the RBpocalypse software 2016. Long benches and IR slots retard this.

Now the dudes hit hard with injuries are actively plotting strategies. I had a stoner dude that barely set his line-up last year show me how he was mapping out other managers players on bye weeks in an attempt to predict who they would drop and when!

I've tried to put a lot of thought into figuring out how to prevent some of the more frustrating aspects of fantasy and eliminating IR is one of the best, IMO. It just encourages laziness and hoarding, it thins depth on the wire... I'm being didactic.

"I feel like you can get a better WR for Howard. Yes, he's unproven, but he's the clear RB1 and there aren't many of those on the market in fantasy. Someone desperate at RB should be willing to part with a much more reliable WR2, someone like Maclin (reach) or Crabtree (lower end). 

I say this because I don't like Parker yet. Miami is terrible and no one but Landry should ever be started until proven otherwise. He's talented though.",fantasyfootball,0

"I'm really not trying to play the ""I told you so-card"", but I've been writing in every thread since pre-season now about Dwayne Allen that Indy let Fleener go simply because Allen was the better blocker and the primary concern this year was keeping Andrew as healthy as possible.  Hence the draft strategy, hence the keeping the perpetually hurt Allen.  Doyle got targets and play even when it was Fleener/Allen/Doyle last year and Luck is, as funny as it sounds, really trusting of his team mates.  There is no reason that Doyle won't keep getting targets as he has produced thus far and Allen will continue to play the role they kept him on for.",fantasyfootball,0
