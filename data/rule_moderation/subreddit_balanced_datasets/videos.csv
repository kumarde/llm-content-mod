"1) it's a single incident among thousands if not millions of interactions per year

2) it's fairly common knowledge they don't need a warrant with probable cause (however made up/forced it is"". obviously doesn't justify the beating. 

3) now the guy claims this is how the entire world sees him. was he this ignorant? does he think people just see everyone as the same? literally everyone sees someone and has some kind of pre judgment. 

i'm white and the one interaction i had with cops was pretty negative. it wasn't physical, but i was threatened with rape by niggers in jail where i'd spend overnight. i mean, it was funny because it was coming from a manlet, but still i had/have a 100% clean record with zero tickets and while still innocent i had to pay $300 in towing fees after just turning 18 and graduating from high school. obviously i didnt get beaten, but thinking whites are treated like puppies is ridiculous. 

i get it, people look at black people differently and i'd say at least 30% if not more of the population is racist in general, but plenty of black people are racist as well and use lame excuses for their problems. they're not the only minority in this country.  i understand it sucks that police are more harsh when they encounter the few adrenaline junkie cops and some people are more suspicious of them for just being black, but having grown up in Flint and now work in Detroit, it is not unfounded and statistically speaking it is backed up. but it is not just a black thing. how youre dressed and act plays a huge role. if youre a black guy in a suit chances are only the legitimate racists will do anything different. do people think white kids that look like trailer trash don't get similar treatment?

> A Chinese person commented on my original post that the term 黑鬼 (hei gui, literally ""black devil"") is the Mandarin equivalent of the English word ""nigger"". This is wrong, and actually, it couldn't be further from the truth. The phrase hei gui in Mandarin essentially means a bad, corrupt, or evil black person. While this certainly isn't a nice thing to call someone, it also doesn't carry any racist undertones. The Chinese have had very little contact with black people during their country's long history and thusly, they don't have many stereotypes or prejudices that are black specific. If you ask a modern day Chinese person to candidly tell you what they think of black people they'll probably say the following, ""They all come from Africa and they all play basketball well."" Not exactly PC or informed, but hardly bigoted.

"This has to be the biggest oxymoron in the world. He's calling the cop racist but calls the cop ""Uncle Tom"" and tells him to go ""pick cotton"" and goes on to call himself a ""regular nigger.""

I really hope this guy gets the boot. Being the garbage man for the city doesn't mean you could have a sense of self-entitlement that allows you to park in a handicap spot. And then the outburst just adds insult to injury. He thought his city job would give him a ""get out of a ticket free"" pass, and the cop (rightfully so) wasn't having it. I applaud the officers for keeping their cool, citing this man, and going about their day. He will (if karma works right) soon be a regular ""nigger"" for real. ",videos,1

From the article: ""A Denver police spokesman said the department is unaware of a complaint regarding the officer in the video, so it is not investigating the situation.""

"People who are pro-vaccines and post this video are either ignorant, uneducated, or paid for by the pharmaceutical companies or pediatric associations (who made millions from vaccines) to continue spread hatred against anti-vaccination movement, which is a movement to bring up awareness that most vaccines are not safe and effective.  

Have you heard of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act - passed by Congress in 1986? This act created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program???? What's that? Well, simply stated, it compensates those injured by vaccines because the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act protects the vaccine manufacturer from being sued for a faulty or damaging product. Claims to the "".Vaccine Court"" were first filed in 1989. Since then, over $2.8 billion in compensation has been paid out to victims of vaccine injury. Yup - vaccines are totally safe! NOT. If they're so safe, why do we need to protect the makers of the vaccines? http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html (Source: CDC, Parents take greater role in childhood vaccines, MICHAEL RESCHKE)

1) History shows us that vaccines did NOT eradicate the diseases that plagued humanity. That is a common misconception -- in actual fact, it was better sanitation and hygiene in the cities that prevented the spread of diseases. These charts, from official sources, show us that vaccines (1) were not responsible, and are not necessary, for eliminating infectious diseases, (2) are not effective, and (3) are dangerous. http://genesgreenbook.com/content/proof-vaccines-didnt-save-us

2) Dr. Oz’s only concern about the flu vaccine appears to be that it contains thimerosal. He went on to advise pregnant women to ask for thimerosal-free vaccines. What he didn’t tell his audience is that The CDC’s own advisory committee, the ACIP, advised NO flu vaccine for pregnant women, with or without thimerosal. http://www.jpands.org/vol11no2/ayoub.pdf

3) As many as 36 children were reported to have died excruciating deaths last night after receiving tainted measles vaccines under a UN-sponsored programme in the rebel-held north of Syria. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11100478/Dozens-of-children-feared-dead-after-being-injected-with-tainted-measles-vaccine-in-Syria.html

"Comparing victims of evil is something I don't like to do, but since you started it: the victims of Bolshevism lie in the millions. So in what kind of world do you give thousands of black victims more weight over millions of Russians and Ukranian victims?

What kind of point are you trying to make? Are you saying that victims of slavery are more valuable as an argument over those millions of nobodies?

You are knowingly completely ignoring the point I am making and that is that Muhammed Ali had no footing to stand on to go around blaming the white man. He has no clue what he is talking about and is a victim of indoctrination. 

How would he respond if someone told him: I don't give a flying fuck about you, the thieving gangbanging nigger does not deserve my care.

I bet everybody would respond quite differently despite the existence of blacks who steal and blacks who kill. Oh wait, in THAT case it's racism, in Ali's case it's justified anger for the evil white slavemaster.

&nbsp;

You say we talk about Slavery because we are in America. Well in fact I am not American, but that is beside the point. The truth is WE weren't talking about slavery.

I, that is me in my original response pointed out that it is logically wrong and historically hypocritical for Ali to take out his anger on the white man.

You can talk about slavery all day, the fact of the matter is: this was a dumb statement to make.

&nbsp;

You claim that the descendants of slaves still suffer racism and discrimination. That is only logical. Discrimination is an evolutionary trait. Guess what: everyone is subject to it. This isn't some Afro-american thing to be claimed because of x and y cherrypicked example.

&nbsp;

So to recap: I am making one point and one point only. One which has nothing to do with the history of the US.

&nbsp;

The draft is immoral. It is an initiation of force against the unwilling and nobody should be subject to it. 
Muhammed Ali was absolutely correct to stand up against it. His reasoning for this, however was pretty dumb and has not much to do with morality or justice. It's merely a tantrum, probably because he didn't know how to express this inate injustice by governments.",videos,1
"BLM is a huge overarching group. Your logic is paramount to all Muslims are bad because ISIS. Sorry reality isn't so cut and dry fella. BLM states explicitly that they are against violence. Pretty much every huge gathering of people has violence but ESPECIALLY when it comes to issues like this. It's not acceptable exactly but when you gather to assemble peacably and are accosted by cops in military gear everytime, it's going to be ugly. 

I would say the cops getting killed wasn't so clear as ""BLM's FAULT!"" Certainly that was a result of the many unjust police killings in this country. Fix that and then people will calm down of their own accord. Sorry, man, it's pretty obvious the institution of police in this country is beyond fucked up.",videos,1

    / I'd just like to interject for moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in  \
    | fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux |
    | is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a  |
    | fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities   |
    | and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.           |
    |                                                                                 |
    | Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without |
    | realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is    |
    | widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware    |
    | that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.              |
    |                                                                                 |
    | There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part   |
    | of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that     |
    | allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The       |
    | kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it   |
    | can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is       |
    | normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is |
    | basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux           |
    \ distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!                            /

It makes sense to not call people nigger though, right? I mean you don't call someone a fatty or faggot or something either. You can of course do so but of course they'll be mad at you. PC is to not make people mad because what's the point. Very reasonable. 

But if someone literally quotes someone to condemn them then there is generally no problem. So there is no reason to hate PC or the left. Just the person who seems to be unreasonable.

It is so annoying to see left, pc and other things being misrepresented, either by people like that woman or by the alt right.

Well, our advanced civilization uses telescopes and space probes, i.e. unmanned lifeless equipment.

Plus, if I was an alien, I would be seriously afraid of some humans shooting down one of our ships or accidentally crashing on Earth or having engine troubles whilst in Earth's atmosphere, humans getting infected with alien flu, etc. 

&gt;I could very well see them wanting to explore first hand just like we would if we could.

"Yeah, hunters and farmers, the people who wolves most directly affect, know nothing about how wolves work. 

There's alternatives that are most likely much more expensive than getting people to *pay you* to manage them.  

Wolves are no longer a threatened species. State game agencies allow hunters to manage healthy animal populations through tags and licenses, treating those animals as a renewable resource. Areas that have healthy populations of wolves and bears should act no differently. 

Why divert taxpayer dollars and resources towards managing a population of animals that aren't even on the endangered species list, when there are other (less photogenic) species that need attention? 

Unless you have some nuanced view I'm unaware of, I'm guessing you don't want people to hunt wolves because you have a Disneyesque view of nature, they remind you of your dog, they're pretty, or whatever, because you didn't actually give a reason as to why you don't want wolves to be hunted.

The insomnia for me comes from not being able to turn my brain off, and get into the mindset of 'sleepy time'. If I lay down, my brain will start trying to think of shit I need to do, or haven't done. I'll end up washing the dishes at 3am, or doing banking and invoices and shit.

"it is a carbon tax. it's combined with a government incentive for renewable energy. at least in alberta it is. energy companies that blend renewable energy can offer their customers a lower price, which is subsidized by the government. so let's say i pay 10 cents per gigawatt for regular energy. the carbon tax taxes me an extra 2 cents or whatever. i think it's less than that but i didn't pay attention. if the energy goes 10-15% renewable (in alberta it's almost always wind energy) the government will pay 3-4 cents per gigawatt of my bill if i use my power company's green energy program. so in my example normal energy would cost me 12 cents a gigawatt. if i go with the green energy it's still 12 cents a gigawatt but the government pays 4 cents, so my bill is down to 8 cents. something like that. there's a limit though to how much the government will pay so if you're an energy hog they stop paying past a certain point and then you're charged 12 cents per gigawatt for every gigawatt you use beyond the limit afterwards.",videos,0

"&gt;[Water levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes)

&gt;The lakes contained in 2009 84% of the surface freshwater of North America; if the water were evenly distributed over the entire continent's land area, it would reach a depth of 1.5 meters (5 feet). The source of water levels in the lakes is tied to what was left by melting glaciers when the lakes took their present form. Annually, only about 1% is ""new"" water originating from rivers, precipitation, and groundwater springs that drain into the lakes. Historically, evaporation has been balanced by drainage, making the level of the lakes constant. While the lake levels have been preserved, intensive human population growth only began in the region in the 20th century and continues today. **At least two human water use activities have been identified as having the potential to affect the lakes' levels: diversion (the transfer of water to other watersheds) and consumption (substantially done today by the use of lake water to power and cool electric generation plants, resulting in evaporation).**


&gt;The water level of Lake Michigan–Huron had remained fairly constant over the 20th century, but has nevertheless **dropped more than 6 feet from the record high in 1986 to the low of 2013.** One newspaper reported that the long-term average level has gone down about 20 inches because of dredging and subsequent erosion in the St. Clair River. Lake Michigan–Huron hit all-time record low levels in 2013; according to the US Army Corps of Engineers, the previous record low had been set in 1964. By April 2015 the water level had recovered to 7 inches (17.5 cm) more than the ""long term monthly average"".

"I only checked your bear attack links but the 6 links you provided only point to two separate instances of fatal bear attacks, one of which involved a female grizzly with a cub, pretty much the most dangerous situation you could find yourself in excepting a polar bear. I think the point of the study was that the majority of people who try to defend themselves with firearms do a poor job of it and end up just making the bear even more angry and it delivers more damage to you in the end. The point is with bear spray you are more likely to deliver an effective deterrent.",videos,0

"Well, I guess. Grizzly bear range has shrunk significantly in the last 100 years and now they're mostly just in the Rocky Mountains with pockets of population mixed elsewhere here and there where as the black bear has more readily adapted to human development and still enjoys a wide range all over North America. 


If you see a brown colored bear and assume it's a Grizzly and play dead like you're supposed to, but said brown colored bear is actually a Black Bear, said brown bear is inclined to start munching on you as Black Bears typically do where a Grizzly otherwise would sniff you and leave your fake-dead-carcass be.
