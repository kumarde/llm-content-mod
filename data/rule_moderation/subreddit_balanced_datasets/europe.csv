"The occurrence of crimes per capita in the asylum seeker demographic are hundreds of percent higher than the occurrence in German and even immigrant populations, even when excluding any border laws.

Also, the report is missing data from NRW, the most populous state and with the most migrants. The report also only includes solved crimes, of which many, if not most reported crimes, are not solved. Take Cologne NYE attacks, almost 1.300 reported-to-police attacks, and I believe just 4 convictions.

The data reveals that without migrants considered, crime rates in Germany would have remained roughly static since 2014. But, in fact, the country recorded an extra 402,741 crimes committed by migrants.

According to the report, most of the crimes were committed by migrants from: Syria (24%), Albania (17%), Kosovo (14%), Serbia (11%), Afghanistan (11%), Iraq (9%), Eritrea (4%), Macedonia (4%), Pakistan (4%) and Nigeria (2%).

Most of the migrant crimes involved theft (Diebstahl): 85,035 incidents in 2015, nearly twice as many as in 2014 (44,793). Those were followed by property and forgery crimes (Vermögens- und Fälschungsdelikte): 52,167 incidents in 2015.

In addition, in 2015, migrants were involved in 36,010 reported cases of assault, battery and robbery (Rohheitsdelikte: Körperverletzung, Raub, räuberische Erpressung), roughly twice as many as in 2014 (18,678). There were also, in 2015, 28,712 reported incidents of fare evasion on public transportation (Beförderungserschleichung).

There were 1,688 reported sexual assaults against women and children, including 458 rapes or acts of sexual coercion (Vergewaltigungen oder sexuelle Nötigungshandlungen).

And of migrant crimes specifically, Syrians top the list of migrant crimes that are NOT related to border controls, with a total of 10,348 individual offences in 2015. They also led assault cases among migrants, with 3,186 offences in 2015.

70 per cent of pickpocketing, one of the crime types on the rise, was committed by non-Germans. Of this figure, 34 per cent was committed by recent asylum seekers, with the rest committed by “non-Germans”.

Foreign nationals are thought to account for around 11 or 12 per cent of the total population of Germany, but were over-represented in every area of crime.

Illegal immigrants and asylum seekers account for around 2.5 per cent of Germany’s population, but were also massively overrepresented.

Amongst total offences, non-Germans accounted for 27.6 percent while illegal immigrants and asylum seekers accounted for 5.7 percent. Of homicides, the figures are 29.3%/8.2%, and of sexual assaults, the figures were 20.5%/4.8%.

"> Well, look at this way. When you have money and could pay the requisite amount for top managers to run your ops in your business for you, earning the money to sustain your business is no big deal. After all, we are talking about a son that inherited millions from his tycoon father here, and not exactly someone that pulls by his bootstrap.

So there is no such thing as a successful business owner? They all hire people to run things for them. Obviously they can't just hire anyone, they need to at least be intelligent and competent enough to select the right people. I don't see how an inheritance matters. There are people who win lotteries that end up poorer than they were in the first place, so managing money responsibly is a skill in itself.

> Secondly, his refusal to reveal his tax return suggest to me he is not as successful as a businessman like he want to potray himself to me.

His assets are [valued in the billions](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/07/22/what-we-learned-in-donald-trumps-financial-disclosure/) while his liabilities are a few hundred million. What more would you expect to learn that was not revealed in his financial disclosure?

> Thirdly, have you forgotten his multiple bankruptcies? Allegations of him stiffing his contractors, oh yes, that sounded like a real classy successful businessman to me too.

I don't know much about the allegations you are referring to, but every successful businessman has failures. If you don't, then you are not taking any risks. Remember, those are not personal bankruptcies, but [Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code), which are not unusual in business.

> Dude, Trump's a huckster. Sure, a rather successful one, but still one. And money is no shield to his idiotic personality, like it or not

So he is a successful huckster? Everything he has done is a lie and a cheat? Sorry, but that is just ridiculous. He employs people, owns property, and is very wealthy, whether you like it or not.

There is a tiny minority of former Yugoslavians like this. However because the vast majority are the opposite they can't be trusted anywhere near the name Macedonia. The goal of Greece needs to shift towards obliterating the identities of nations that support Skopje. Skopje's sole  purpose of existence is attack Greece by proxy.

The essence of our nation/country/people will die, because too many non-white people will come here and produce a white minority.

My point is:

1. The recent migrant crisis alone by no means is enough to produce a white minority. Migrants have an influence, but the recent wave is nowhere near enough to produce a total sea change. Even with the large Turkish minority, Germany has still been pretty white and traditional in its self-conception.
2. Further to that pragmatic critique, I fundamentally reject his ideological equation of a nation with a race or birthplace. I reject the notion of a national essence or character. And I reject the prejudiced myth that there is some grand difference of culture that makes Western Europe *inherently* better - there isn't, for all that I like it here nowadays, that's a total delusion historically speaking.
3. On a more whimsical note, monocultures are boring. A nation/culture becomes richer and healthier when influences meld, new diasporas arrive, and old traditions aren't clung to only for the sake of it.

>What about white majority countries outside Europe? Should we be welcome there?


Who is ""we""? I don't know who you are. The way you are talking, it sounds like you are a non-white person living in Europe. Europeans moving to America and Canada is fine with me, that's how America and Canada were founded, by Europeans.

>How do you feel about ethnic cleansing in the Balkans?

I feel like the EU's mass immigration programs are the catalyst for a similar scenario, but on a larger level. The Balkan war was a situation that arose from national boundaries not matching up with ethnic boundaries. It's a great lesson that teaches us that multiculturalism and ""diversity"" does not work and only creates conflict.

>If a thousand Muslim Arab teens move to Europe, and work their whole lives without breaking a single law, is that bad?

Yes, because they are taking away resources (houses, money, jobs, space) away from indigenous communities. Plus, those 1000 Arabs will multiply and become 3000 Arabs, then 6000, then 10000, and so on. That is how Europe got into the situation it is in today, the migration snowballed, the non-Europeans exponentially reproduced, invited more non-Europeans, they reproduced, and so on.

>If it is bad, what if 1 of them becomes a strong advocate for equality. Women's rights and lgbt rights. Is he still bad?

Yes, because that person is going to encourage more Arabs to come to Europe. Europe does not need any Arab for the promotion of LGBT and women rights. White people can promote those just fine.

>Does a native born European have more right to European resources, even if he does nothing, than a hard working migrant from Africa?

It's a silly exercise. There will always be crazy people that try and hurt or kill politicians. It's very easy to use backwards reasoning and try and find sone vague statement by a politician to point to as the cause. It's just stupid all around. 

I also find it ironic that people accuse trump of inciting violence and calling for assassination when the majority, as I see it, of violence is targeting trump and his supporters. Remember the guy that tried to rush trump as he was giving a speech and then was invited on a major news network to see his idiotic views to the masses for attacking/ trying to assassinate trump (or whatever his plan was)? How about the British kid that flew to the us to assassinate trump? Or all of the groups on social media platforms openly calling for and planning trump assassinations that aren't treated with this type of contempt? Or even removed by the social media platforms? 

How many trump supporters have tried to assassinate clinton or jeb or sanders so far? I can't think of 1 and I'm pretty sure the media would have a great time with something like that and make sure we all heard about it.

I don't want any politicians calling for assassinations or violence. That's why I think it's vital that we call it out fairly, evenly and without any bias anytime it happens. This is not happening right now at all and the whole trump violence narrative, as far as I can tell, is completely false.

&gt;I disagree with you here, based on the fact that we can still see that people who are poor are still less likely to get the same outcomes in life as people born rich. That means that your family wealth is a big factor in how your life will end up. That's not meritocratic at all, is it?

"Specialized law firms, who are authorized by the copyright-holder send collected IPs to a state attorney - time of the infringement, IP and subject of the infringement, and the state attorney then decides, that the service provider has to give out the real address of the customer, using the IP at that moment. 

With this decision from state attorneys, the internet service provider has to give away the real contact person's address. 

For some special law firms, this appears as a business on its own, as state attorneys wave these claims through in bulk, these law firms send warnings for copyright-infringement, together with a monetary claim, without any real court decision, that really ruled for or against a plaintiff. 
This is huge business. 

That's at least the case for file sharing. With Redtube, it was streaming, and it was questionable, if the IPs were even found out legally. 
When get mail via copyright infringement via file sharing, they claim their rights, because you share with others, therefore they see this as ominously ""distribution on a business scale"", and with this law firms make profit. They wouldn't earn money by bemoaning the download of a single file, or watching a stream.

"&gt;So how do we explain why we don't see a representative mix of races (or genders) across society?   

There are two genders and we see those equally enough in my opinion as a woman. As for races, I already told you why. We're majoritary white countries.  

&gt;Why are black people in the UK less likely to be economically mobile than white people?   

Because of their lifestyle. Less likely does not mean less able, just that less people actually are economically mobile.   

&gt;Why are women more likely to earn less than men in the same job?   

Ah, wage gap. A false myth, already proven so by heaps of research. Of course certain jobs happen to pay more or less, and women tend to choose the less paying jobs. 

&gt;If we agree that everyone has the same potential, why are there these differences in outcome? Is it perhaps because there is *not* an equality of opportunity? That society is *not* meritocratic?  

Meritocracy in politics would be a disaster. But in society? It's as meritocratic as we can get without creating a certain class of people that simply get more access to education. Here this class already exists, kids at National Colleges (300 year old, most prestigious high schools) have on average parents who also studied at a National College. And it's not because they have more money or something similar.  
It's simply because intelligence is mostly hereditary and in the National Intelligence Test the children of ex-NC graduates get the highest marks. 


&gt;Could it possibly be that there are structural aspects to society whereby women or non-white people are disadvantaged?      

In Europe? No.

&gt;Could it be that these structural aspects are legacies of the racist and sexist nature of society in the past, and continue to propagate into the current time?

In fact on the one side people from the balkans, tunisia, algeria and morocco are more criminal than Germans, but tbh I don't really see a reason why they are refugees in the first place.On the other hand people from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan are less criminal than Germans. 

This is statistically wrong. In Austria, 6 out of 100.000 persons with austrian citizenship were reported for rape in 2014. For Germans, the number was 12 per 100.000.

...and we're not talking Cologne, Hamburg, Munich, Berlin here, where gentrification is already the norm for years now, it's your average shitty town all over Germany. 

Funny thing is, that I haven't even adressed homelessness. I personally know people don't crank up their radiators now to save money, sit at candle light in the evening reading books, not because it was that romantic, but to save money by lowering the electricity bill. 

But homelessness is indeed a problem in my town, too, as this has significantly risen - risen to such an extent, that homeless shelters aren't sufficient enough for about three years now, where at the same time houses for asylum seekers for about four times the amount of people were opened during the last twelve months. 

People see this kind of schizophrenic treatment of people here. I doesn't need to be close to reality for the majority - it's obviously enough, when it's reality for a minority of people, that's steadily growing.

Podemos was born as a consequence of 15-M and the two main parties being unable to analyse and fix the population concerns.

Right now the bipartidist system is absolutely shattered in Spain. We have three main political parties (PP, PSOE, Podemos) with 5 million votes each, except for PP that got 8. Ciudadanos has around 3 million, also important, but they haven't get as many seats.

Podemos is on the left of PSOE, so they go a bit more to the core of the left-wing ideals. Sort of like Syriza (minus the euroskepticism) before they turned what they hated about PASOK and turned a pro-austerity party in fact.

Right now Podemos is only 300k votes away from PSOE, and with this fracture in PSOE it seems like PSOE will suffer so much and probably split and lose many millions.

Canada has tried to redefine its history as not the British Empire ever since the WW1 battle at [Vimy Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_National_Vimy_Memorial).

&gt;The Battle of Vimy Ridge has considerable significance for Canada.[125][Note 7]

&gt;Although the battle is not generally considered the greatest achievement of the Canadian Corps in strategic importance or results obtained, it was the first instance in which all four Canadian divisions, made up of troops drawn from all parts of the country, fought as a cohesive formation.[126] The image of national unity and achievement is what initially gave the battle importance for Canada.[127] According to Pierce, ""The historical reality of the battle has been reworked and reinterpreted in a conscious attempt to give purpose and meaning to an event that came to symbolize Canada's coming of age as a nation.""[128] The idea that Canada's national identity and nationhood were born out of the battle is an opinion that is widely held in military and general histories of Canada.[129][130]

Up until 1982, when the Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau [patriated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Canada) the Canadian Constitution, the British parliament still had to pass certain Canadian laws. It's a sore point to this day.

&gt;Endorsed by all provincial governments except that of Quebec (led by René Lévesque), **this was the formal Act of Parliament that effected Canada's full political independence from the United Kingdom**. Part V of this act established an amending formula for the Canadian constitution, the lack of which (due to more than 50 years of disagreement between the federal and provincial governments) was the only reason Canada's constitutional amendments still required approval by the British parliament after ratification of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.

But probably even more important, the UK is just 2% of Canada's trade.

Proceed with caution! Viewers discretion is advised!**

The statistics say that British men are almost as ugly. 27.5% of the mothers who gave birth in the UK in 2015 were born outside the UK. And 27.2% of the fathers were born outside the UK. 

But if you like naive assessments as much as I do, you could spot a trend if you look at individual countries.

Here's [Table 2: 10 most common countries of birth for non-UK born mothers and fathers, 2015](http://i.imgur.com/tdH5FR0.png)

Of the foreign born parents, they were from:

- Poland: 22,928 (ranked 1st) mothers, 17,704 (ranked 2nd) fathers
- Pakistan: 17,342 (2) mothers, 19,236 (1) fathers
- India: 13,780 (3) mothers, 13,798 (3) fathers
- Romania 8,734 (4) mothers, 7,857 (6) fathers
- Bangladesh 7,752 (5) mothers, 8,699 (4) fathers
- Nigeria 6,829 (6) mothers, 8,339 (5) fathers
- Lithuania 4,872 (7) mothers, 3,512 (10) fathers
- Germany 4,667 (8) mothers, 3,972 (8) fathers
- Somalia 4,636 (9) mothers, 4,286 (7) fathers
- South Africa 3,537 (10) mothers, 3,618 (9) fathers
- Others: 97,150 mothers, 88,774 fathers

If we assume (remember, we love naive assessments) that the only choice of a foreign person is to have kids with someone from their own country or a person born in the UK: 

- 5224 or 30% of all Polish mothers in the UK had a child with a British man
- 1360 or 39% of all Lithuanian mothers had a child with a Brit
- 877 (11%) Romanian women
- 695 (17%) German women
- 350 (8%) Somalian women

And 

- 1894 or 11% of Pakistani fathers in the UK had a child with a British woman
- 1510 or 22% of Nigerian fathers had a child with a Brit
- 947 (12%) Bangladesh men
- 81 (2%) South African
- 18 (0.1%) Indian men

Conclusion: Indians and South Africans stay among themselves. British man love European woman. While British woman love Non-European man.

"There are lots of models for this. Canada and Poland are countries to look up to.

We can still maintain a fit for duty personnel of close to our current size of about 950K. People would still sign for a draft, but in peace time we are civilians. Interested people can do a voluntary military service often in exchange for indirect benefits in some form, tax relief, titles etc. This is how most countries do it.

The idea is that you focus on the rapid reaction force, which all are highly trained professionals. Unlike our current reserve, these can be sent in full or in part to even minor aggression, if a similar to Crimea if ever happened in Finland. 

The other part is those who went to voluntary service being a part of the active reserve, like today, but being fewer they can be given qualitative training. The rest is taken according to their current abilities. Poland has 15M, Canada has 7M fit for duty even without conscription. If we have 950K fit for duty, we pick up to lets say 1/5 according to criteria if aggression ever accelerates to that level. The benefit is being able to pick servicemen according to current abilities. This would favor picking 25 to 35 year olds with strongest physics and the shortest barrier to learning.  The idea here is that a 30 year old with a relevant MS.c and 5 years relevant work experience needs only a fraction of the time to learn something versus an 18 year old whose biggest life accomplishment thus far is Matrix multiplication.

The idea isn't to end military service, it's to end conscription. Filter out the unmotivated, stupid and physically weak from service because they are quite frankly not worth the effort for active reserve. Not only does this cost in conscription, but there's uncertainty involved in a soldier still being either fit for duty at 30 in which he was assigned to at 18, or whether he simply is now better somewhere else. E.G. an Amphibian guy becoming a Doctor after military service, that Amphibian training was thus a waste of resources. 

Better to leave that guy who will only ever be intermediate in active reserves and put him directly in the inactive reserves. Better to spend his resources on the guy who with current conscription spending would become good to make him and excellent serviceman.

"Telegraph is behind a soft paywall, link the text please next time:

&gt;In just over 100 days since the referendum there have been plenty of assumptions by economists and international competitors about London’s future as a financial centre.  

&gt;Brexit presents clear and present risks. Our financial markets – which raise billions of pounds of investment capital for UK and European economies, support 7 million UK jobs, and pay billions of pounds in taxes – must be protected. But to assume the City will automatically diminish ignores a fundamental business truth: the customer is always right.

&gt;Immediately post-referendum my colleagues visited China (with the new Chancellor) and India and discussed how London can finance their growth. These two rising economies need trillions of dollars for new infrastructure, which their banks and governments say they cannot provide. They raise this money offshore through bonds, denominated in their own currency to avoid currency risk, known as Dim Sum or Masala bonds.

**FAQ | Brexit and the City of London**

*How does the City operate under the EU?*

*As it stands, the City operates under uniform EU rules, which allows Britain to export financial services worth more than £20bn, or 1.1pc of GDP, to the EU.*
*What about after Brexit?*

*One of the major uncertainties facing financial services will be the level of access to EU markets they are granted in the event of a Leave vote.*

*Should Britain enter some form of associate membership, it would throw into doubt this ""passporting"" of financial services. UK firms and regulators would have to ensure they still comply with the raft of Brussels' existing regulations in order to regain access to the single market.*

*For some bodies this would hardly be a hindrance. Others, such as clearing houses, could face serious disruption.*
*What if Brexit is less amicable?*

*A messy Brexit - in which relations between the UK and the rest turn sour - could represent a ""worst-case scenario"", where the UK's financial services are no longer deemed equivalent to European rivals under the EU's regulatory regime.*




&gt;This fast-growing business could go anywhere globally, but the UK is leading. This year we listed more Dim Sum bonds than the rest of the world, excluding Greater China itself. We are also the leading venue for Masala bonds. When India’s largest financial services conglomerate, HDFC, raised $450 million in London, it said London “distinguished itself by offering a wide range of financial instruments and enjoys unshakeable trust from international investors”. 

&gt;A good example is clearing. It is a fundamental and mandatory part of the plumbing that keeps the global financial system going, ensuring millions of complex trades are settled in a safe and regulated way. Clearing houses act as firewalls or circuit breakers, guarding the rest of the market against default by companies by holding collateral and monitoring transaction risk. London is the world leader in this critical sector. Last year its leading clearing house, LCH, cleared 90 per cent of interest rate swaps – one of the largest asset classes.

&gt;Meanwhile, we excel in the traditional work of raising capital, finding billions for companies to invest by giving them a deep and liquid capital pool and a breadth of investors. The UK is also unique in having a successful growth market specifically for SMEs: AIM has raised £15 billion of capital for British and European SMEs this year. Other countries have tried but failed to establish similar markets.

&gt;Where London leads the world, the European economy benefits. Indeed, our range of services and asset classes mean we provide efficiencies that save customers capital across the eurozone. LCH clears all 17 major currencies, so it can also reduce or eliminate risk; last year it saved customers $25 billion in regulatory capital, which could then be invested in the real economy. Some claim euro clearing will automatically move back to the eurozone after Brexit, yet clearing euro trades separately means losing these efficiencies. This could cost firms tens of billions of dollars – taking money from the European real economy. And there is, logically, only one other financial centre that could centrally and efficiently clear all these currencies. It is not Paris, Frankfurt, or Amsterdam, but New York. 

&gt;The UK financial ecosystem, with clearing at its heart, makes London the most economically attractive and stable destination for global investors and issuers. It is no longer just a few banks transacting individual products but the innovative home of global finance. Our opportunity now is to put greater access to finance for entrepreneurs at the centre of post-Brexit industrial strategy.

&gt;This ecosystem must be championed and protected. The best way is to secure continued regulatory equivalence with the EU, membership of which also provides equivalency with the US. But people in Europe and the UK should realise this isn’t a zero sum game. If business leaves the UK, the European economy would suffer – and very little of that business is likely to go to Europe anyway.

"I'm not sure. It may be that they are focusing exclusively on occupation costs outnumbering Marshall Plan.

What I've noticed is they misunderstand the type of loans they received. Typically a loan does not come exclusively out of export profits.

I understand the argument that you are making, but I have rarely read that genocide is a modern phenomenon or one that only can be considered from a modern, moral standpoint.  Historians have never been interested in the study of genocide, the killings of civilians are not of interest.  This is the argument that Steven Pinker formulated for why genocide has not until recently been applied to events pre modern times.  Yet now it is.  The massacre in the Vendee region of France is now often argued to be a genocide, an event that took place in the 18th century.  And following on from this, how do we class the Mongols utter destruction, an event that has a higher mortality event than any other once you account for world population (Pinker).  Is there complete destruction of cities and the slaughter of all their inhabitants simply honorable conquest or is it genocide? 

I'm not entirely sure how you can be so forthright in your argument here.  And yes, the Fall of Carthage is argued to be one of the first (at least well documented) genocides, see [http://gsp.yale.edu/sites/default/files/first_genocide.pdf](http://gsp.yale.edu/sites/default/files/first_genocide.pdf) or other similar links for the argument to why.",europe,0

* Quite strongly. While a lot is shared with our neighbor, when it comes to culture, I do believe French culture is unique (just like German culture is, or Italian).
* It definitely has shaped my worldview in a specific way, but - also talking from experience - it can be understood by people who are strangers to it. Whether or not it'd be accepted is another story, but at least people can understand.
* Quite a lot, actually. When it comes to it, and when you go abroad, I see/realize that my European roots and culture (and then, French) definitely shaped and defined me a lot, when I compare myself to foreigner. Here however, I'd more say that it's the European culture is more important than the French/is more predominant, when it comes to that point.

"Regardless of it being a desirable end in and of itself (by my view it wasn't but there's an argument to be made) Sèvres was only viable if there were troops there to enforce it, and with the Russians out of the war there weren't. The only powers fully committed to that goal in the area were Greece (which was in political turmoil, quick to alienate Turkish populations in its occupied territories, and managed to screw itself over at every turn) and Armenia (which was tiny, flooded with refugees from the recent Genocide, and was also at war with Azerbaijan and Georgia).

Also given the demographics in the area (a lot of which had to do with recent Turkish actions admittedly) it's also quite debatable whether it was 'fair' anyway apart from the proposed Kurdish state, which would however still be shorn of Kurdish areas in modern-day Syria and Iraq (almost the entirity of its proposed territory was in modern-day south-eastern Turkey, a lot of the Kurdish-majority regions furthern north would've went to Armenia per Sèvres).

Honestly, trying to give a go at a renewed reconcillationist-minded Ottoman Administration (with a degree of institutionalized power-sharing) would arguably have been much more beneficial to its minorities rather than trying to impose the punitive peace as we got that inevitably resulted in an extremely sectarian war that saw the ethnic cleansing of millions of Turks, Greeks, and Armenians.

"&gt;  Stopping the migrants in the Balkans is wrong, while paying Turkey to stop them in Turkey is a totally great solution

I never heard anyone saying the Turkey is a good solution, and I would like to hear the quote from Merkel saying that. The fact is that it is at the moment the only really viable solution, even when it is a bad one. The situation with stopping them in the Balkan is that first, the nation where the people would be stranded is Greece, a nation that is already overstraigned with their own problems. The refugee camps were, and I am not sure if it become better (due to the lack of media attention at least from what I read), in a horrible condition and there was no way Greece could have managed to make them better. Due to that, the influx of refugees in Greece, that would have risen further if there weren't the turkey deal, would have increased the misery even more. Next point is that there is only a green border between Greece and the Balkans, meaning that it can be breached at any point and it is rather easy to get enough manpower from the sides of the refugees to break eventually through every blockade, is it a fence or anything. The only thing that would have stopped the refugees than would be shooting them down, which is not an option (or at least for any decent human being). The fact that it didn't happen was that the influx of migrants went down after the Turkey deal. 

The Turkey deal works better out of two reasons. Turkey is bigger and still financially more stable (even when this area collapses at the moment thanks to Erdogan). The situation in the refugee-camps is there not good as well, but way better than it would have ever been in Greece. Also, the water-border between Greece and Turkey (which was the way most refugees landed in Europe) is easier to patrole and to defend without killing the refugees thereby. The missing of the land-to-land border (again, there is one, but I never heard it is used by refugees) is keeping the tension at bay and potential violent outbreaks of desperate refugees less likly.",europe,0

People love to bitch about debt, yet a lot of it has to do with it - suddenly large parts of the society could ""afford"" houses. Luxurious, compared to what earlier generations had. The grand debt and pension model assumed that the population growth will continue. Not that the boomers ""indulge"" and then ""indulge"" more with cruise ship trips &amp; sunny life in the South. The bill will be paid by their kids.

**This was never the norm in history.** Things like the October Revolution happened, because people were in genuine shitty conditions and the highly centralised absolute monarchy had not enough mechanisms to adapt. This can't be said today.",europe,0

"So I guess it's a good thing that America doesn't want loaned money back from Deutsche Bank. 

----- 

&gt; After all the money Germany loans to Greece, goes to Greek banks, and from there back to German banks, meaning the money is recycled in a loophole.

That's how money works. The economy is all about moving money around. 

An example: You work for VW. You decide to buy a nice VW that costs 40,000 Euro. But you don't have that money so you ask the VW bank for a loan. They make a deal with you, you don't have to pay interest but they get your full salary until you have paid back the whole sum. (Don't worry, your wife has an income as well). A week later you crash the car. Unfortunately you didn't bring the insurance application to the mailbox in time, so you have no insurance, and the scrap metal dealer only gave you 100€ for the car, so you basically turned your 40,000 Euro investment into 100€. 

So you work at the VW factory for two years, but as soon as the factory transfers that money to you, you have to transfer it to the bank. 

According to your logic you were ripped off because you had to work for free. Because the money they gave you went to the bank and the bank gave it back to VW, meaning the money was recycled in a loophole.",europe,0

Majority of Northeastern Turkey was populated by Turks and Laz, a caucasian people. After Russian Empire took control of Upper Caucauses, peoples like Circassians moved to those regions, increasing muslim population there.

According to Armenian Patriarchate, Armenians only made %40 of the population in Six Armenian Vilayets aka Western Armenia aka Wilsonian Armenia, while according to official Ottoman records in 1912, there numbers were around %30. Only city they were a majority was Van, while in cities like Sivas and Elazığ they werd somewhere between %30 and %50.

"Submission statement:

I think this is a great idea. While in general I don't want the state to interfere with how people dress, burqas are in a category of their own. First of all, they prevent individuals from being identified in public, which is already against the law in many places. Second, burqas and similar garments clearly reduce the ability of women to function as equals in society. This idea runs diametrically counter to European ideas. Finally, we can't pretend like there isn't powerful symbolism behind the burqa. With Saudi-funded Wahhabism sweeping across Europe, wearing the burqa is increasingly associated with radicalization and extremism. Especially in the Balkans were people were subjected to forced Islamization for centuries it's easy to see why such symbols rattle people's nerves. However, the same is true even in Western Europe, where Wahhabi preachers have increasingly caused many Muslim communities to become increasingly isolated from broader society. Banning the burqa of course can't solve all of these problems, but it's a step in the right direction.",europe,0
