"I just want to take a moment to say something - FUCK you.

I was that little kid once upon a time. I ordered a pizza and had it delivered. All I had was tips from helping my brother work at a Snow-ball stand so it was all coins and I tipped the pizza delivering faggot $10 as well cause I figured all the coins were a hassle. The asshole walks up to the door and I hand him change and he says ""if there's not enough money in here I'm coming back."" So I told him to ""keep the fucking pizza,"" took the money back, and called the pizza joint who said he would be paying for the pizza.

So since you're probably him - fuck you.",nba,1

MVPS and rings are easily the two most important criteria when comparing all time greats. Curry is about to be tied in rings, and will catch up in MVPs shortly. He's already eclipsing Lebitch

LMFAO

you're a little bay area bitchboy, knew it

you should probably delete your account and start fresh because it's instant entertainment reading your shit comments. open your account during the Playoffs to spew your garbage opinions, only to watch your team get sonned by LeGOAT

>Unanimous MVPS:
Curry-1
Every other player in NBA history- 0

LOL

you can't stand the fact that somebody might be better than Curry at something, your comments should be enshrined so everybody knows how much of a fucking moron you are

god it was fun reading those

oh and btw just a lil tease: 

Curry's five worst shooting games last year:

83 points on 102 shots 

Harden's five worst shooting games last year: 

66 points on 67 shots - 43 FTA

In other words, as I said, Curry just keeps chucking, Harden gets to the line. 

Get sonned, bitchboy, and don't expect another response after I witnessed your retarded-ass comment history.

It's a complicated and encompassing stat taking multiple years of on/off and lineup data to measure a players impact. [This] (https://cornerthreehoops.wordpress.com/2014/04/17/explaining-espns-real-plus-minus/) article can give you a decent idea of where it comes from. 

Klay's DPRM seems probably a little low because he has consistently played ahead of really great backup defenders like Iggy and Livingston. Since his replacements typically outperformed him on D (through no fault of his own they're just really good), the holistic data may have him look a little worse than he is, hence its own shortcomings. For the record, a -2.35 is a replacement level RPM, so his -1.1 is still pretty good.

Stats don't lie, but if you don't know actually what they means and their own shortcomings then you can draw some pretty crappy conclusions.",nba,1

"I do not watch NBA basketball. However, my friends started a fantasy basketball league last year, and implored me to join. I crashed my car into a tree while trying to draft from my phone (never again), so I autodrafted. That's where it began...

My shooting guard was a guy named Gordon, and he was getting me points, non-stop. Kyle Lowry are Paul George were two other guys who were good for me (I got to draft the first two rounds and they were the guys I picked), and soon I was on top of league, and the hobbit (that's what I'd started calling him) was one of my top scorers.

I can't explain why I began to obsess over him. Maybe it's because he kinda looks like me. Maybe it's because I like his last name a lot. But I started watching his highlight tapes. And then I started watching his games. Everytime he dunked, I felt like a proud mother.

I know nothing about the city of Houston, but I watched the whole 30 for 30 documentary about them because I was hoping he would be in it somewhere, but he wasn't. Now, I'm mad at Houston, because he should be starting, and they're not starting him.

I want the hobbit to read this. I want him to know I'm his biggest fan even though I don't root for his team and that he should go somewhere that starts him. I want him to know that he's one of the best players in the league and he should ask for top-5 shooting guard money. I want him to know that I love him.

I know players come to these subreddits sometimes and answer questions, so if the hobbit ever comes here, please forward this to him! And if anyone knows how I can contact him, just to send him an email (I know it will be going to his agent and not him), I'd love to tell him that he's made me a real basketball fan.

Sincerely,

Eric Gordon's Number One Fan

I just can't wrap my head around what you're saying, ""how do you think we got the president we just did"" ..... none of the major media was saying trump was gonna win, 

http://www.businessinsider.com/prominent-poll-shows-hillary-clinton-dominating-early-voting-and-on-likely-on-the-cusp-of-victory-2016-10

^^ that one might have been my favorite. I had to actually read through the actual content mostly by watching the rallies, trumps were a lot different than clintons and I had a good feeling after his last one in east lansing tuesday night that he was gonna pull it off. So in my case, I didn't look at any media headlines, I dug in by listening to the nominees themselves and crowds and the local news in the respected areas. On the contrary if I just listened to the media or this lovely Freudian slip up by CNN, https://streamable.com/5yb0 I would have assumed clinton won.

He joined a team with championship pedigree that had two other great players. The only difference is that your a Cavs fan instead of a Warriors fan. Even going back to CLE was a ""non competitive"" move when you look at the personnel they had. Ride Lebron's dick. It should be very clear to you why you feel the way you do. You're either a CLE fan or a Lebron fan so Lebron's ring chasing directly benefits your interests. Kevin's ring chasing directly opposed your interests, hence your insistence on agreeing with one and disagreeing with the other. This is simple shit I shouldn't have to explain to you but since most of you CLE fans are ten year olds I don't mind educating you on personal bias.

So they (the general peanut gallery) started trying to emphasis that as a wing player blocks aren't required. And just kept at it. So I made a thread showing how all these wing players who are shorter and play significant less minutes are blocking more shots. Once again it was trying to teach Algebra to motherfuckers who can't do arithmetic. Since you guys were too stupid to understand my point y'all just made up some primitive bullshit.

"On offense, the three second violation occurs when any player stays in the paint for more than three seconds. Whether the offensive player is being guarded or not is irrelevant, there's no legal way for an offensive player to stay in the paint for more than three seconds, unless the basketball isn't currently in the offensive team's frontcourt.


On defense, in order to be legally allowed to stay inside the paint for more than three seconds, a defensive player must be ""closely guarding"" an offensive player. ""Closely guarding"" is defined as being within an arms reach of an offensive player.


Now, this doesn't mean that the three second violation will be called. Watch any NBA game and you're almost guaranteed to see a couple of uncalled three second violations per game. It's one of those rules that will usually only be called if it's particularly flagrant.


I think most sport fans are somewhat cocky in general, however there are a couple unique circumstances about why the 3-1 joke is a thing.
1. The Cavaliers had never won a championship before
2. [Cleveland in general was known for being ""cursed"" in professional sports.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_sports_curse)
3. The Golden State Warriors had just finished with a historic 73-9 record, beating the Bull's 72-10. (A record many considered almost unbeatable)
4. This was a highly anticipated rematch, as GSW and the Cavs faced each other the previous year. However, due to injuries, the Cavs were missing their second and third best players that year.
5. Golden State in general was incredibly hyped up by the media.
6. The OKC Thunder had just blown a 3-1 lead against Golden State.
7. There were a lot of off-court things going on that ""stirred the pot"", so to speak. Draymond and his nut-kicking allegations, Klay Thompson said that Lebron ""probably got his feelings hurt"", ""Is Lebron declining?"", etc.
All of this added up to a finish that was pretty much an instant classic, so of course people will make jokes about it.


If you're referring to the semi-circle that is under the basket, that's called the restricted area. I don't know if you're familiar with charge and block rules, but when a player stand in the restricted area, they are ineligible to draw a offensive charge from the player attacking the basket. This is to prevent secondary defenders from constantly flopping

"Westbrook is averaging less turnovers per game than Harden right now. If you actually look at the numbers and watch the games you'd probably have a better understanding. The Thunder played without their second best player for almost a third of the season so getting Oladipo back is going to help the TO numbers because there's another go-to go for OKC. If you wanna keep being a condescending douche that's your business, but Russell Westbrook is a better player than James Harden so go fuck yourself.",nba,1

Noah absolutely has the right to do what he did. He should not be given any racist backlash or death threats. As recent events showed, people take their patriotism way too seriously and have extreme reactions to these acts. 

Personally, I don't think he should have skipped the dinner. According to his statement, he supports the troops but not the wars we send them to fight. That's a perfectly fine thought and I even agree to a limited extent. But I can't help but feel that he could've gone to the dinner just to express his support for the troops.

Also if the Thunder finish with a top 3 or 4 record I could see Russell getting votes.

"Yes it does, because the answer to the question 'why was Embiid considered a top pick even though he played only 23 minutes a game in college?' is because of his Skill-Set. In the minutes he played he was DOMINANT, to the point of being compared to Hakeem Olajuwon.  At that point the minutes you play doesn't even matter.  What matters is what you did in those minutes.  

What Jokić did in the minutes he played was DOMINATE. He pet up the highest RPM and BPM for ALL CENTERS.  His PER was 21.5, highest ever for any true rookie from Europe, higher than his own countryman's Vlade Divac's highest career PER, he put up the highest AST% for a rookie center in the 3 point shooting era, he shot 33% from 3 and 81% from the free throw line as a 20 year old rookie center  (better than DIRK at the same age), from all sophomores drafted in 2014 Jokic already leads them in ALL ADVANCED STATS  including the ones that factored in minutes (WS, VORP, WINS, nERD,).   And that's only scratching the surface of what he did.

I'm not grossly overrating him, I'm telling you FACTS.  The Fact a that he DOMINATED last year as a 20 year old rookie and he will continue to DOMINATE as he inevitably improves his game.  

P.S. KAT is also on the path to greatness and it's super likely he'll have a few years as the best player in the league.  You can tell that from his rookie year, you can tell that from his skill-set, you can tell that from his early dominance.",nba,0

So if you're asking me who I want to get a basket from an isolation perspective, I'd feel more secure going with DeMar. But if I wanted a basket, period, then my selection falls on Klay.

Overall, I do believe Klay is the better scorer based on his efficiency, his long-ball, and his now improved handle. Yeah, it's a bit more low-key and does benefit from having Steph alongside him, but I reckon you could put him on any team in the league and he'd get you 20+ on a TS% in the late 50's. 

If Klay ever found a way to get to the line more, while maintaining his current production by shooting from the field, this debate wouldn't even exist.   ",nba,0

"To Malone's credit, I do think that the Spurs are just a better run team than the Jazz. We're talking about one of the best run franchises ever vs. a collection of really good seasons that the Jazz had. Sure, there is recency bias, but Duncan had some all time greats to play with in Parker and Manu, and Kawhi for a shorter period of time. Duncan played with a ton of great role players. I just don't think the same can be said for Malone. Although individual players stand out, it is a team sport.

It's hard to compare the 2 even though they played the same exact position. The Jazz weren't really able to compete if Malone wasn't scoring, whereas Tim (still a more well rounded player) had to use different skills to contribute. Duncan had one of the most dominant runs in the playoffs ever back in 2003 I think?

In a weird parallel universe where Duncan and Malone were the same age, and they had the same skill level expertise on their respective teams, I'd pick the Spurs all day.

Probably has to do with the fact that they have to work everyday up to 60 or whatever, but your point stands IMO. ",nba,0
"Robinson dropped *slightly* more, but he also had injury issues later in his career and overall still had a higher PER.

The largest difference between Malone and his contemporaries is his TS%. For his regular season career he averaged .577, the playoffs he dropped all the way to .526

.526 TS% is worse than every guy you've listed and for someone whose offense was his main skill, that isn't really a shining endorsement.

Jordan literally dropped .001 TS% in the playoffs, but he's the GOAT. Olajuwon actually raised his TS% in the playoffs and Barkley went from an absurd career TS% of .600+ down to a measly (/s) .580ish

Robinson did drop his TS% as well by about 3-4%, which is less than Malone's 5% and comparable to Barkley's drop, but still more of a drop than the other guys.

I think another thing that doesn't get taken into account by most people is that Robinson (pre-injury) was BY FAR the best player on his team. His best teammate ever was Duncan, but after that who? Sean Elliott? An older Terry Cummings? Compared to Malone who had Stockton for almost his whole career and an amazing coach in Sloan with roleplayers like Jeff Hornacek who is arguably better than Elliott.",nba,0

"Might be controversial but I don't care one bit about ""our troops"". They know what they're getting into and had a choice. The US military is not some glorious global fighting force for good, despite what the Navy commercials tells you. The military is there to advance and protect US government interest and the business interests of prominent American businesses. The war in the Middle East, about oil control, not revenging Americans that died on 9/11. The terrorists were from Saudi Arabia not Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan. Don't forget the US Gov't sells weapons to countries with the worst human rights record. Stop acting like the military is some divine symbol for freedom and America.  All the new military members I see are 18-24 yr old kids collecting a paycheck or getting the GI bill while they figure out what they want to do.
