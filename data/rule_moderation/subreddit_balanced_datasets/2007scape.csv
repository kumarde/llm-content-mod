"Even if he is autoswitching (which he is, the way his mouse teleports at parts of the video. I can do perfect switches consistently and my mouse doesn't even move in the exact same movement every time like this guy. I have 1000s of hours nh experience and it is very obvious to me.) who cares lol. He is shit compared to most nhers I play with. Like he'd legit get bodied playing against people like me who are dedicated nhers and don't use auto switchers. When I'm not at school, gym, studying, or with friends, I just practice nhing on private servers every chance I get (some days 8 hours+). There's at least 10+ dedicated nhers I can think of off the top of my head, who i play against regularly every day on different servers, that would blow a player like this out of the water. He's slow as fuck, no fakes, no delays, no 1 ticks, he misses 15%s constantly, and his character movement is not on the level of a great nher. Doing simple 4 way switches against clueless players is really not hard. I am in the process of making a no honor montage (i've been collecting clips for weeks just need to cut and compile them all) and I will post it to this subreddit soon when I am finished. You will see the massive difference between someone like this who is slow and uses an autoswitcher and someone like me who can switch faster without an autoswitcher and fluidly change my playstyle because I'm actually doing the clicks manually. The thing about using an autoswitcher is he has to use it because he is slow in the brain. He just bullies retards who have no clue how to pk on osrs. Legit wouldn't be able to keep up vs a real nher. That's just fact edit: sorry for rant. nhing is just an art form I am passionate about and it's sad seeing shit players like this even getting as much attention as they get. mark my words when I release my frag video I will be seen as one of the goat nhers, second only to backb0ne, for the time being",2007scape,1

The third DMM tournament ended with one player dying to the fog after reasonably believing he was the last player alive. Meanwhile another player choose to stay in the gas and eat through the damage using a combination well known and legal mechanics. His damage healed per second remained above the gas's damage dealt per second. Most players likely assumed that this was not possible and thus dismissed this obvious strategy.

"10000% agree. Everyone is on this bandwagon, but honestly anyone who though woox would actually win $10k with that strategy is out of their mind. To be honest, woox knew that strategy was going to work from the beginning, and he knew that Jagex had overlooked Phials and others as a method to unnote food. He could have told Jagex before the event about this oversight, as people are expected to do when they know of an exploit. Sure, he wouldn't have been recognised the way he has been now, but it would have been a better outcome for the integrity and growth of the game, if this tournament resulted in one fair winner. That being said, I am not putting all the blame on woox, what he did was very clever but I think he did not make the ethical decision, and more than that, he definitely was never going to win the $10k like that.

Also, no matter what people say about Jagex making up rules and Jagex awarding previous winners who tick ate, what woox did was anti-competitive behaviour. In a competitive tournament, that matters a lot. all other winners participated in a much greater way than woox did.",2007scape,0

No, that's a really shitty way to run a tourney.  You set rules in advance, and you can disqualify people for not following those rules.

Inflating currency devalues everything, so you are left with having to add fundamental resources as a drop. 

Currently we are experiencing an initial crash though, it will reach a point where Wintertodt won't be good money and less people will do it so the resources linked to seeds will rise to a median price. The only unfortunate thing here is what Wintertodt did to redwood logs which was bound to happen regardless, when they release more content for the logs they will rise again. 

I didn't see the value at 10k per ppot before though, it was very obscure that consumable resources were so high. They weren't that much better than food for most slayer tasks (Still are worse for a lot) and wherever they were used the cost was covered by the monster's drop table while only impacting the profits the player made marginally.

Jagex removed the un-note feature from banks since they didn't want players to stand at banks and un-note food to stay alive, and wanted the tourney to be based on who was left standing last after killing everyone else from PvP.

Woox stayed alive only because Jagex forgot to remove the un-note feature from Phileas(NPC) and Woox took advantage of that oversight to be the last one standing.

So do I think Jagex made the right decision? Yes, DMM is suppose to be last person standing from PvP not tanking fog till everyone else dies.",2007scape,0

At the end of the day, Jagex wants the L0l0l0l0l0l guy to win because it's Twitchcon and having Woox game the system isn't good advertisement for the game.. But Woox did not break the rules, he was the last one left. So technically he should have won.

Maybe I am biased because I think very highly of Woox, but he didn't do anything against the rules and YaNeverLearn did the same shit and he won the first season.

Jagex is trying to make this an eSport, and just about anyone knew that doing that would cause the fans to uproar... making it an even worse publicity stunt. Super stupid on their part.
