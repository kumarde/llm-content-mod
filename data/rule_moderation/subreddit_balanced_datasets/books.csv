you mean ""brainwashed"".

Don't forget, *""history is written by the winners""*

Take what you read and hear in the (((mainstream media))) about dear ol' Unclde Adolf with a grain of salt.",books,1
"Don't think you really understand the book.

First major point is that a main theme is pride/competence/power is the flipside to arrogance and that sword named ""Folly"" in the inn.  

The story starts in a world he ruined, where he's lost most people important to him and gimped himself.  He nearly asphyxiates himself as a child, he starts a pissing contest with a noble and teacher, he can't bring himself to borrow money from rich friends so he gets into very dangerous situations, he breaks into a professors room and is party to arson, he jumps off a roof, and a hundred other things stemming from that character flaw.

It is most bluntly explained by the character who is the ""Kvothe of last generation"", Elodin, who in his own arrogance drove his pupils to insanity or Auri-ness:

> I suddenly realized what was going on. “Oh God,” I said. “Whose rooms are these?”

>  Elodin gave a satisfied nod. “Very good. I would also have accepted, Why don’t you have a key for this room? or What are we doing in here?” He looked down at me, his eyes serious. “Doors are locked for a reason. People who don’t have keys are supposed to stay out for a reason.”

>  He nudged the heap of smouldering cloth with one foot, as if reassuring himself it would stay in the fireplace. “You know you’re clever. That’s your weakness. You assume you know what you’re getting into, but you don’t.”

>  Elodin turned to look at me, his dark eyes serious. “You think you can trust me to teach you,” he said. “You think I will keep you safe. But that is the worst sort of foolishness.”

----

Second point is he isn't a Mary Sue.  There is almost always numerous people that are better than him in anything he does (exception of music) and he frequently loses or gets by through luck.  He barely survives in Tarbean, is beaten, is almost raped (Felurian flashback), and it takes two(?) years to get out of there.  He is worse in medicine, math, alchemy, poetry, Naming (Fela), etc., at the University.  He loses his fight with Devi.  He has no idea what to do leading mercenaries in the forest.  He has no competence in friendship or relationships, and after learning enough about sex to ""not embarrass"" Felurian he can only be the target of flings (explained by Fela) and ends up hurting Denna who is forced to sell sex/flirtation to survive.  He winds up being at a ""talented child"" level of fighter after leaving the Adem.  An old granny ends up knowing more about medicine than him.  

And really, Odysseus is not a Gary Stu-- he's the sort of character you get to tell a meaningful story about.  An average protagonist either requires endless dei ex machinis or you tell a story with a limited much more limited scope, and that isn't what the fantasy genre is about.

----

Third point is that the unreliable narrative is **important to the plot**.  Bast has been trying to get Kote to tell his story in the *right way*.  He lures Chronicler and warns him to avoid talking about ""her"" or the music in the Inn with multi-part silences.  He wants Kote to remind himself he is a hero and tricks bandits to (hopefully) get beat up, flatters Kote when he kills the spider demons, interrupts at key times.  The reason is that story telling is a mechanic of the world that effects things.

There is a reason that the Chandrian kill his parents for telling the wrong types of stories, why Skarpi is imprisoned for the same,  why Felurian wants stories told about her, why Denna is learning some form of magic and composing propaganda, why Elodin is startled when he thinks Kvothe is changing his name often, why records of certain historical things have been expunged by secret societies, why the Edema Ruh were persecuted, and a reason why time is spent going into Kvothe changing a sword's name to ""caesura"" in a series called ""Kingkiller"".  There is a reason the author uses certain numbers of words in phrases and dozens of other clever little things.  It's a brilliant book.",books,1

"> In what way is it different?

Nobody owes you a platform. You can still express yourself in other ways. Pretending that taking away someone's platform is ""silencing"" them is simply nonsense. 

>No it wouldn't, because I wouldn't be halting the publication. Do you really not see a difference there?

No, there is absolutely no difference whatsoever. You do not have a right to a platform to speak from, period. 

>Not being denied, having a platform removed. I'm happy to discuss the differences, but either you need a lot of evidence as to why it's denied rather than removed. Otherwise, you're going to have to convince me why having a platform removed is not the same as being silenced.

Because they are literally different things - you do not have a right to a platform, you still retain all the same rights you did before and you can still spread your views any number of other ways. He can self-publish, he can tell anyone he likes, he has zero rights whatsoever to the use of anyone else's platform however. 

>You mean like the difference between refusing to publish someone and authors with no contact trying to swing their might to stop someone from being published? You're right, that's quite a difference.

Those authors are absolutely in their rights to refuse to work with a company who does business with someone they find hateful and bigoted, yes. Are you under the insane delusion that a publisher has a right to demand they keep working for it? That's ridiculously ignorant. ",books,1

*Hamilton* is a great example of how this can work wonderfully.  Does it matter that the cast is all non-white (with one exception), in spite of the historical figures being pasty European-descended?  On one hand, yes, because it opens up the ""inclusion"" factor to all of those people who aren't accustomed to seeing such stories include folks who ""look like them.""  But on another hand, no, it doesn't matter at all, really.  And that's the point, isn't it?

Ramsay Bolton murdered his father and became Warden of the North. 

Rickon Stark was captured by the Boltons.

Every sport cost the University money and they don't provide any profit. So now imagine how many kids will lose their scholarships if we were to suddenly do away with football. 

For a lot of youth football is their only way to a better life, either through scholarships or professionally. Organizations like the NFL donate millions of dollars every year to charities and help out their communities all the time. Just look at what the Saints did for New Orleans after Katrina. 

Also, the history of football has been vital to the growth of universities around the country since it's inception. Winning programs brought in more money, more support and more donations that have allowed them to build up their schools and use that money for better research and professors. In fact it can be argued that the reason the US has one of the best higher education systems in the world is because of football.

"“Are you so frightened of death, Dion?” I asked. Probably the wrong words, but speaking was better than remaining silent.

“Why wouldn’t I be?” Dion said. “Death is the end. Nothing. All gone.” He looked at me, as if in challenge. When I didn’t respond immediately, he continued. “Not going to tell me everything will be all right? Mom always talks about how good people get rewarded, but Panos was as good a man as there was. He spent his life trying to cure disease! And look at him. Dead of a stupid accident.”

“Why,” I said, “do you assume death is the end?”

“Because it is. Look, I don’t want to listen to any religious—”

“I’m not going to preach at you,” I said. “I’m an atheist too.”

The kid looked at me. “You are?”

“Sure,” I said. “Almost fifteen percent—though, admittedly, several of my pieces would argue that they are agnostic instead.”

“Fifteen percent? That doesn’t count.”

“Oh? So you get to decide how my faith, or lack thereof, works? What ‘counts’ and what doesn’t?”

“No, but even if it did work that way—if someone could be fifteen percent atheist—the majority of you still believes.”

“Just like a minority of you probably still believes in God,” I said.

He looked at me, then blushed. I settled down beside him, opposite the place where he’d had his little accident.

“I can see why people want to believe,” Dion told me. “I’m not just a petulant kid, like you think. I’ve wondered, I’ve asked. God doesn’t make sense to me. But sometimes, looking at infinity and thinking of myself just . . . not being here anymore, I understand why people would choose to believe.”

Ivy would want me to try to convert the boy, but she wasn’t here. Instead, I asked a question. “Do you think time is infinite, Dion?”

He shrugged.

“Come on,” I prodded. “Give me an answer. You want comfort? I might have a solution for you—or at least my aspect Arnaud might. But first, is time infinite?”

“I don’t think we know for certain,” Dion replied. “But yeah, I’d guess that it is. Even after our universe ends, something else will happen. If not here, then in other dimensions. Other places. Other big bangs. Matter, space, it’ll continue on without end.”

“So you’re immortal.”

“My atoms, maybe,” he said. “But that’s not me. Don’t give me any metaphysical bull—”

“No metaphysics,” I said, “just a theory. If time is infinite, then anything that can happen will happen—and has happened. That means you’ve happened before, Dion. We all have. Even if there is no God—even supposing that there are no answers, no divinity out there—we’re immortal.”

He frowned.

“Think about it,” I said. “The universe rolled its cosmic dice and ended up with you—a semi-random collection of atoms, synapses, and chemicals. Together, those create your personality, memories, and very existence. But if time continues forever, eventually that random collection will happened again. It may take hundreds of trillions of years, but it will come again. You. With your memories, your personality. In the context of infinity, kid, we will keep living, over and over.”

“I . . . don’t know how comforting that is, honestly. Even if it is true.”

“Really?” I asked. “Because I think it’s pretty amazing to consider. Anything that is possible is actually reality, given infinity. So, not only will you return, but your every iteration of possibility will play out. Sometimes you’ll be rich. Sometimes you’ll be poor. In fact, it’s plausible that because of a brain defect, sometime in the future you’ll have the memories you have now, even if in that future time you never lived those memories. So you’ll be you again, completely, and not because of some mystical nonsense—but because of simple mathematics. Even the smallest chance multiplied by infinity is, itself, infinite.”

I stood back up, then squatted down, looking him in the eyes and resting my hand on his shoulder. “Every variation of possibility, Dion. At some point, you—the same you, with the same thought processes—will be born to a wealthy family. Your parents will be killed, and you will decide to fight against injustice. It has happened. It will happen. You asked for comfort, Dion? Well, when the fear of death seizes you—when the dark thoughts come—you stare the darkness right back, and you tell it, ‘I will not listen to you, for I am infinite Batmans.’”
The kid blinked at me. “That . . . is the weirdest thing anyone has ever told me.”

"That poor boy is going to be raked over the coals by the women of his generation.

It’s so sad to see empathy like that, which will of course be taken advantage of by the horrible myopic women which came out of the millennial generation. Generosity, empathy, kindness; these are things which women destroyed so they could lie about their own dispositions and attitudes toward other human beings. Women ruined the planet and now they’re bleeding over everything, ruining whatever good things are left. Soulless, vapid, tramps.

This boy is a perfect example of a soul not made for this world. He will be eaten alive by the female “humans” (the Nazis were technically human, though one would doubt their humanity; same thing) which populate this generation.

"Well, I didn't find her being weak as a problem. I mean, if you think about it, they'd probably condition these children to be as mild and unassertive as possible, right? They want docile clones. There's an innocence to Kathy that I suppose can seem ""unbearably boring and weak"" but I appreciate as it makes her an everyman (or everywoman I suppose).

Ruth, I find, is one of those aspects that feels very grounded and realistic for a story like this. In real life, it's very rare that you simply have great friends that you are completely best friends with, and then people that you just hate, and there's only bad feelings. It's rarely that black and white. Ruth is an example of a very flawed person, who nevertheless through the strength of her personality is an important part of a social clique at Hailsham, and what we get is a complicated relationship with Kathy. And it's partly due to Kathy's weak personality, as stated above, that Ruth gets away with what she does. 

As for your last point, I feel that it does explore this future, but not in the typical manner that most writers do. Most stories about this kind of future go for the more exciting, adventurous side of it, a la Michael Bay's The Island, or Logan's Run, or any number of stories along those lines. This book is about following the side that we never see, the more mundane side of the world, the ones who don't quite have it within them to rebel against the system in the bold heroic way that we would like to in our most optimistic visions.",books,0

&gt;There has never been a Catholic Prime Minister in the UK and Catholics tend to hit a glass ceiling in institutions such as the military too.

Since the opposite was exactly the problem that was complained about by protestants, and was no small part of why eventually got James II and VII deposed (you don't go blindly eroding the rights and privileges of the class that's your core base inconsequentially.  Some think he was doing his master, the sun kings, bidding).  Maybe the backlash has never really ended, or got ossified in British institutions.  It might reflect a subtle distinction but continuous thread in power too.  The old english landed gentry was mostly roman catholic, while the up and coming Bourgeous power, the nouveau riche, were mostly protestant, in Max Weber '[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism)' fashion, with the latter being the only ones really in control politically, with true power, maybe since [1832](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Act_1832).

Not *exactly* as it is really spoken, no, but they do use many of the common sentence structures and idioms of spoken language.  Mainly my point is that a human author can easily make a study of how dialogue functions in others' works and then use that in their own without actually making a ""derivative work"". (again, in the legal sense, obviously that still would be artistically derivative), I don't see that it'd be any different if it were a machine doing effectively the same, even if the result was some AI dialogue and not a book.

"Yes, and looking at tyrion, beyond his appearance, he IS the clever lannister, the good strategist, someone lannisters should be proud of. But tywin refused to let tyrion ever have casterly rock, and iirc there was a passage about someone saying to tywin that tyrion truly was his fathers son, which made tywin furious.  
I'm actually on the fence about legends though. There could be some truth to them. The Targaryens had a vision of the doom of valyria, and that turned out well for them. Another interesting legend is something danys maid tell her, ""there were once two moons, one cracked, and dragons spilled out of it."" Then much later, tyrion is watching a speech by a red priest, and he cant understand the words, but the gesturing is exactly like the moon dragon story. The same legend in different cultures? Suspicious, especially when so much time was spent on describing a mysterious red comet before. Add to that, the impact of a comet or moon crashing into earth would mean a dust cloud covering earth. ""The others first came during the Long Night."" Could this even be the origin of seasons being abnormally long? This is tinfoil area, but what I wanted to say is that big events would create legends, and there is obviously magic and dragons etc in Westeros. Legends could be distorted over time.

The literally making them dumber to fulfill the role is kinda shitty but what if we got the point where we could pre-screen infants to determine their aptitudes and then we simply encouraged them towards the jobs.

"&gt; I just don't see how the outcome of the work is worth it. How is planting the wheat, harvesting it, threshing it, milling the wheat into flour, and baking the flour into bread, worth all of that work, when all you get at the end is a loaf of bread?

Because you get to eat.

&gt; Same with cooking in general. 2 hours to make a meal that lasts 10 minutes, not worth it

Because you get to eat.

&gt; Or learning an instrument.

Because you get to play music. I *really* don't understand you here.

Do you not like eating or music?

From a previous post of yours:

&gt; Honestly, my only goal in life is to somehow acquire enough money that I never have to work again, so I can sit inside and do nothing for the rest of it.

You would get bored. How do I know you would get bored? Because soon after you said:

&gt; I was really big on programming, and I caught on to it really quickly.

Programming is as much a challenge in intelligence as it is an art form. You seemed to have fun learning it, but from your post it sounds like you had troubles applying what you learned. That's fine though and totally normal. Point is, your mind enjoyed the challenge in figuring out how to talk computer - which isn't easy. If you did *nothing* you would grow bored out of pure mental idleness.

What gets me is you also said:

&gt; In my personal experience, practice accomplishes almost nothing.

Now, I'm not trying to judge you because you are some person on the internet; I do now know who you are. *Assuming* from your posts, you enjoy video games too as well as arguing [debating] big topics. Do you honestly think a game would be fun if it played itself and just showed you the ending credits? Do you think any game would be fun without challenge? Do you think the characters in your favorite anime would have got far if they didn't challenge themselves or others? You definitely enjoy using that mass between your ears, but you seem pretty depressed, defeated, deflated, and generally dreary. (Maybe cause your British :p j/k)

I must ask you, how do you define success?

I ask you because I learned to play guitar. I'm 'ok' at it. I didn't pick it up to make money, or fame, or make womans undies wet. I picked it up and learned how to play guitar so I can play music. Not for anyone else in this world but me. RARELY I will play in front of someone. I don't care to. I spent many many hours getting frustrated, with sore fingers and a weak forearm. I've cut my fingers on strings and just sat there playing the same note. I spent so much effort to learn so I can be happy making music that comes from me. ***I*** can play music now. 

It's not any good mind you. I won't be cutting any record deals lol. I don't care to. Why should I?

To me, success is finding happiness in yourself through your actions. Some people say it's money but meh, money comes and money goes. Memories last in my mind longer than any coin in my pocket. Success is making good memories.

Why did you quit programming? Because you didn't immediately make some killer app you can retire off of? That's a lame excuse.

"The Peripheral, by William Gibson.
This is my fourth time through this book. Gibson has said in interviews that sci-fi is usually based in the time that it is written, and this is a good example; though it is stuffed with inventiveness, much of it can be extrapolated from trends today.  It takes place in two time periods with informational access to each other, in which information is translated into economic and social power to solve a mystery.  The central character, Flynn, is a wonderful protagonist, her gamer name, ""Easy Ice,"" is a clue to her ability to deal calmly and courageously with outrageous changes in her life and to act constructively to assist and to protect her loved ones.  I recommend the audiobook version highly, read so expressively by Lorelei King.  My favorite Gibson book, and that is really saying something.  ",books,0

"What's the point? 

If they get out they're out of touch, they are less skilled, they are more likely to reoffend. If all letting them out does is cause problems when they aren't rehabilitated, then why punish them. 

We pay more for prisons if we don't make it possible for people who get out to end up with a job, a life etc. 

Perhaps it might be justified for murderers or rapists, but I don't see why we should treat people who shoplifted or sold a blunt the same way. 

Why create a heavier burden on society by punishing them all without giving them the best opportunity to avoid going back to prison? 

We're just going to end up paying for them to be housed and maybe used as low/unskilled labor(below the minimum wage), which makes other people outside of prison less attractive to hire for the same work at a higher rate. ",books,0

"Dude, I'm not going to argue with you. You seem to have a very convenient view of politics that blames literally everything on the left while placing no blame on the right. I'm not sure what kind of people you've been talking to or what polls you've been looking at, but people in the US aren't getting further right. The GOP has simply allowed itself to be taken over by extremist religious zealots who would rather focus on discriminating against gay people, keeping trans people in certain bathrooms, and demonizing minority groups rather than responsible fiscal spending, a smaller role for the federal government, and aiding small business along with the working class. 

The younger generation is turning out to be the most educated and most liberal generation in US history. You may be watching a little too much Fox News.

* ""Under the Weather"" was a really sad story, and I ended up liking it for that reason, even if it was extremely predictable.

After trying to get a response from his office and failing, I sent MY agents to the task. His office told them that their hands were tied. That means either they personally just have no interest in pursuing the endeavor or they're under contractual obligations &amp; thus out of luck.

"This reminds me of the censors in PRC. The CCP would ban some words or phrases in Weibo, for example, so users would think of euphemisms or substitute some characters with the same sound and/or tone, or a different word entirely. Then the euphemisms would get popular and CCP would ban the euphemisms. So then users would think of a euphemism for the euphemism and CCP would end up playing censorship whack-a-mole.

This is why censorship never works well, google or not.

"That's so strange to me because edits all digital now so my first thought would be it's dependent on the country to allow it but I guess it's more of the distribution company's responsibility to do that.

"This is a great comparison &amp; graphic; though personally I think we're looking at more of a combination of the two. There's no doubt that on the surface Huxley's vision seems to be more evident, but you don't have to look very far to find examples of increasing control, austerity, political bluster, etc that lean more toward Orwell. It's as if we have this veneer of the precursors to brave new world that we are often enthralled by, but from beneath it the political framework of 1984 keeps poking holes through that surface whenever things start to get a bit tense.
