"The day of September 31st, I was home alone, watching Shrek. I heard a ring at the doorbell, and walked over. Looking out the door, I saw a car driving away, and a small package sitting on the doorstep. Curious, I brought it inside and unwrapped it. It was a case with “Jacob Slendtorius” written on it in Comic Sans. Confused, I scratched my head and pulled out the case. I opened it up, and inside was a CD. I placed the CD in my CD player and white noise played. I heard scratching at my window, and as I approached, the noise on the CD got louder, and so did the scratching. My heart was racing. Faint noises of breath hitting a microphone sounded from the CD. I listened closer - it was Jacob Sartorius’s distorted mixtape. The sound of autotune echoed in the background. Suddenly, from my window, I saw a beanied, gnome-like figure, the stench of popcorn singeing my nose. Behind him was a tall, dark figure wearing a sweatshirt and bearing the most hideous of braces. The mixtape, the gnome figure, the scratching - I knew it could be only one thing. It was Jacob Slendtorius - I thought he was just an urban legend, but the hideous beast was standing mere meters away from me. “WHAT IS UP DRAMALERTNATION, LET’S GET ROIIIIGHT INTO THE NEWS,” the gnome whispered. I screamed, and my ears began to bleed. The taller figure - the one I had now recognized to be Jacob Slendtorius, slowly walked forward. Frantically, I pulled up the YouTube app on my phone and disliked all of his videos and unsubscribed. The Slendtorius approached me slowly and awkwardly, now only feet away. In a raspy, pre-pubescent, autotuned voice, with a menacing chuckle and intrusive grin, he told me that I could wear his sweatshirt. “I don’t want to, please, leave me alone.” I replied. His grin dropped and his face went blank. He came closer, making me increasingly uncomfortable. He warned me that if I do not post this on Reddit, I will be forced to listen to his mixtape for the rest of my life, and he will make me “wear his sweatshirt.” The Slendtorius left seven lyric pages and self-advertisements and promotions on the ground, and forced me to hide them in the forest. He vanished into the night, along with his smaller gnome figure. I took the god-forsaken CD, and attempted to break it - but it wouldn’t crack. Hammered it, scratched it, threw it, sat on it, digested it - but it wouldn’t break. I put it in the CD player once more, and it was a message from the Slendtorius. “You must share this CD, give it to an unsuspecting person, and do not mention me. You will otherwise be forever cursed, just like this CD.” I put it in the mail to a random address, and my life has been normal ever since. I had my phone on me at the time, and was able to take a few pictures for proof. I took pictures of the CD case, the silhouette of the Slendtorius at my window, and a few other pictures that ended up being corrupted. These are those images: http://imgur.com/a/14UhC http://imgur.com/a/mg864 2spoopy4me",AskReddit,1

"I agree that we all suck at communicating sometimes. But your examples aren't exactly equivalent - ""Black people are criminals and muslims are evil terrorists"" are pretty opaque value judgments. Those are the epitome of hateful stereotypes.

""Men interrupt women"" is actually a pretty valid generalization. Men DO interrupt women at a far higher rate, and they aren't even aware that they do it.

Do you think Muslims aren't aware that there are Islamic terror cells out there? Do you think black people need to be reminded about crime in black communities?

Men really AREN'T aware of how they treat women sometimes. Hearing some facts about how they unconsciously talk over women could actually be beneficial for us all. It really isn't the same.

Now, if a woman said ""men are rapists"" then that WOULD be a value judgment. And weirdly enough, I don't see those kinds of arguments at all. Even on the hardcore feminist websites reddit loves to hate. I DO see them talking about rape and catcalling and how they're terrible and how men should do more to help prevent it.

"The day of September 31st, I was home alone, watching Shrek. I heard a ring at the doorbell, and walked over. Looking out the door, I saw a car driving away, and a small package sitting on the doorstep. Curious, I brought it inside and unwrapped it. It was a case with “Jacob Slendtorius” written on it in Comic Sans. Confused, I scratched my head and pulled out the case. I opened it up, and inside was a CD. I placed the CD in my CD player and white noise played. I heard scratching at my window, and as I approached, the noise on the CD got louder, and so did the scratching. My heart was racing. Faint noises of breath hitting a microphone sounded from the CD. I listened closer - it was Jacob Sartorius’s distorted mixtape. The sound of autotune echoed in the background. Suddenly, from my window, I saw a beanied, gnome-like figure, the stench of popcorn singeing my nose. Behind him was a tall, dark figure wearing a sweatshirt and bearing the most hideous of braces. The mixtape, the gnome figure, the scratching - I knew it could be only one thing. It was Jacob Slendtorius - I thought he was just an urban legend, but the hideous beast was standing mere meters away from me. “WHAT IS UP DRAMALERTNATION, LET’S GET ROIIIIGHT INTO THE NEWS,” the gnome whispered. I screamed, and my ears began to bleed. The taller figure - the one I had now recognized to be Jacob Slendtorius, slowly walked forward. Frantically, I pulled up the YouTube app on my phone and disliked all of his videos and unsubscribed. The Slendtorius approached me slowly and awkwardly, now only feet away. In a raspy, pre-pubescent, autotuned voice, with a menacing chuckle and intrusive grin, he told me that I could wear his sweatshirt. “I don’t want to, please, leave me alone.” I replied. His grin dropped and his face went blank. He came closer, making me increasingly uncomfortable. He warned me that if I do not post this on Reddit, I will be forced to listen to his mixtape for the rest of my life, and he will make me “wear his sweatshirt.” The Slendtorius left seven lyric pages and self-advertisements and promotions on the ground, and forced me to hide them in the forest. He vanished into the night, along with his smaller gnome figure. I took the god-forsaken CD, and attempted to break it - but it wouldn’t crack. Hammered it, scratched it, threw it, sat on it, digested it - but it wouldn’t break. I put it in the CD player once more, and it was a message from the Slendtorius. “You must share this CD, give it to an unsuspecting person, and do not mention me. You will otherwise be forever cursed, just like this CD.” I put it in the mail to a random address, and my life has been normal ever since. I had my phone on me at the time, and was able to take a few pictures for proof. I took pictures of the CD case, the silhouette of the Slendtorius at my window, and a few other pictures that ended up being corrupted. These are those images: http://imgur.com/a/14UhC http://imgur.com/a/mg864 2spoopy4me",AskReddit,1

"I am a co-founder and CEO at Rezi, which is a company my best buddy and I started right after we graduated college and realized that it was so hard for students to find gainful employment. We set out to make a series of solutions that students could use to make a more effective resume, faster and cheaper. 

This was in June 2015. 

Now in October 2016, we've helped over ten thousand job seekers, several thousands customers, and have launch Rezi in Korea and just recently a resume generator which will be free and lowers the time to make one to just 23 mins. 

I know this sounds like a sales pitch, but it is what we do. 

Here is why I'm happy. 

At the age of 23, I quit a cushy corporate job, moved to Seoul, South Korea and we worked super hard to launch Rezi Korea. And Korea has been absolutely fantastic. It was a huge risk, but we just got accepted into a government program, giving us a huge office and a very useful investment.

We were isolated from those  who were minorities at the time (mainly those of African, Caribbean, South/Central American, Asian and Pacific Islander descent.) Our best friends were descended from Swedish, Hungarian, Russian, German, British Italians, Greek, Lebanese, Israeli and other ancestors. I did not know or hear of anyone who was not a U.S. Citizen. We were all ""Americans.""

I did have one friend whose parents were Japanese. We had coin collecting in common. His parents, who had left the west coast and migrated to Ohio to escape the post WW2 prejudices. They were kind to me and seemed unaware of my non-oriental ancestry.

I did not experience racism until I traveled to the southern United States in the 1970's. Lots of ""...Them Niggers and Them Jews"" haters there at that time. (their words, certainly not mine- we were never raised to be so ignorant)

Recently there has been an uptick in racism. Suddenly, there is unfounded hatred and rampant bigotry.

I see the media and the politicians feeding off of us.

"Animal care and service workers typically do the following:

Give food and water to animals
Clean equipment and the living spaces of animals
Monitor animals and record details of their diet, physical condition, and behavior
Examine animals for signs of illness or injury
Exercise animals
Bathe animals, trim nails, clip hair, and attend to other grooming needs
Train animals to obey or to behave in a specific manner
Animal care and service workers train, feed, groom, and exercise animals. They also clean, disinfect, and repair animal cages. They play with the animals, provide companionship, and observe behavioral changes that could indicate illness or injury.

Boarding kennels, pet stores, animal shelters, rescue leagues, veterinary hospitals and clinics, stables, aquariums and natural aquatic habitats, zoological parks, and many laboratories house animals and employ animal care and service workers.

The following are examples of types of animal care and service workers:

Nonfarm animal caretakers typically work with cats and dogs in animal shelters or rescue leagues. All caretakers attend to the basic needs of animals, but experienced caretakers may have more responsibilities, such as helping to vaccinate or euthanize animals under the direction of a veterinarian. Caretakers also may have administrative duties, such as keeping records, answering questions from the public, educating visitors about pet health, or screening people who want to adopt an animal.

Animal trainers train animals for riding, security, performance, obedience, or assisting people with disabilities. They familiarize animals with human voices and contact, and they teach animals to respond to commands. Most animal trainers work with dogs and horses, but some work with marine mammals, such as dolphins. Trainers teach a variety of skills. For example, some may train dogs to guide people with disabilities; others teach animals to cooperate with veterinarians or train animals for a competition or show.

Groomers specialize in maintaining a pet’s appearance. Groomers may operate their own business, work in a grooming salon, or run their own mobile grooming service that travels to clients’ homes. Demand for mobile grooming services is growing because these services are convenient for pet owners, allowing the pet to stay in its familiar environment.

Kennels, veterinary clinics, or pet supply stores employ groomers, where they groom mostly dogs, but some cats, too. In addition to cutting, trimming, and styling the pet’s fur, groomers clip nails, clean ears, and bathe pets. Groomers also schedule appointments, sell products to pet owners, and identify problems that may require veterinary attention.

Grooms care for horses. Grooms work at stables and are responsible for feeding, grooming, and exercising horses. They saddle and unsaddle horses, give them rubdowns, and cool them off after a ride. In addition, grooms clean stalls, polish saddles, and organize the tack room where they keep harnesses, saddles, and bridles. They also take care of food and supplies for the horses. Experienced grooms sometimes help train horses.

Keepers care for animals in zoos. They plan diets, feed, and monitor the eating patterns of animals. They also clean the animals’ enclosures, monitor their behavior, and watch for signs of illness or injury. Depending on the size of the zoo, they may work with one species or multiple species of animals. Keepers may help raise young animals, and they often spend time answering questions from the public.

Kennel attendants care for pets while their owners are working or traveling. Basic attendant duties include cleaning cages and dog runs, and feeding, exercising, and playing with animals. Experienced attendants also may provide basic health care, bathe animals, and attend to other basic grooming needs.

Pet sitters look after animals while their owner is away. They go to the pet owner’s home, allowing the pet to stay in its familiar surroundings and follow its routine. Most pet sitters feed, walk, and play with pets daily. More experienced pet sitters also may bathe, groom, or train pets. Pet sitters typically watch over dogs, but some also take care of cats.

Work Environment[About this section] [To Top]
Animal care and service workers held about 232,100 jobs in 2012. About 82 percent of these workers were nonfarm animal caretakers, and 18 percent were animal trainers.

Animal care and service workers are employed in a variety of settings. Although many work at kennels, others work at zoos, stables, animal shelters, pet stores, veterinary clinics, and aquariums. Mobile groomers and pet sitters typically travel to customers’ homes. Caretakers of show and sports animals must travel to competitions.

Although most animal care and service workers consider the work enjoyable and rewarding, the work may be unpleasant and emotionally distressing at times. For example, those who work in shelters may see abused, injured, or sick animals. Some caretakers may have to help euthanize injured or unwanted animals. In addition, most of the work involves physical tasks, such as moving and cleaning cages, lifting bags of food, and exercising animals.",AskReddit,1

"Varsity, the company that holds a national monopoly on school cheerleading supplies and competitions.
If you have a daughter that's competing in intramural cheerleading competitions from middle school on up, parents have to pay out the nose for official Varsity outfits and supplies or they cannot compete in the events. Dues have to be paid to Varsity for a myriad of ridiculous things. If their team is judged to win the intramural competions they can go to ""nationals"" which is a complete scam, there's more ""national"" competitions that Varsity makes money from than there are states in the country.
Then there's safety. Did you know that more cheerleaders go to the hospital for injuries than football players?
Cheerleading isn't considered a sport. Varsity wants to keep it that way, because if it were considered a sport, there would have to be one state championship per state and one national championship, ensuring Varsity would make less money. Also with sports comes oversight in sports safety. Having enough spotters would be scrutinized and some types of dangerous activities might be banned in competition.
TL;DR: If you have a daughter interested in becoming a cheerleader, Varsity Inc. owns every single aspect of it from start to finish, squeezes as much money out of your wallet as possible, and compromises safety to make more money.
Edit: I first found out about Varsity because of an episode on cheerleading in Season 8 of Penn & Teller's show ""Bullshit!"". I recommend watching it, I'm glad I know about the racket before my daughter is in school.",AskReddit,1

"When I was 16-17 I worked at the CVS closest to my high school. One kid a grade or two younger then me came into the CVS looking shady as shit, goes to the condom aisle. I can't see shit, don't really care. He runs out still looking shady as shit. Somewhat intrigued I go to the aisle and find just an empty box of condoms. 

Two days later, I run into the kid at school. Never had any interaction with him previously, just recognized him. I then yell out to him ""Hey Asshole, if you are going to steal condoms from CVS-"" at this point he turns bright red and starts to shrink down ""Steal the entire box so I don't have to clean up your shit."" And he lets out the biggest sigh of relief I have seen.

"I'm from Portugal. Our head of state is Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. I didn't vote for him, actually I voted for the complete opposite candidate because Marcelo was known to be a very conservative type of politician and it didn't seem the right way to go for my economic crisis driven country. He won with 60/70 % of the votes which made me hugely disappointed.
I'm actually surprised now because he turned out to be a really ""liberal"" and conscious president. He is really determined to battle this feeling of dread that our country is in because of the economic recession. He agreed and legalized to many proposals from the left wing parties, such as gay marriage, better salaries for the public sector while maintaining a discreet yet totally professional image of himself opposed to the last president who was only good to spend money traveling around and smiling at people. 
Other head of states could learn that actually listening to the needs of the population is a good thing. He actually listens to the people's proposals and is very much connected with the Portuguese people. Also he is a very active and concerned politician who doesn't, in my perspective, allow politic games to change his decisions.

Segun from World War Z (and pretty much all the characters from the book)

Sister Act 2.  The first movie doesn't qualify, but there is no romantic subplot at all in the second movie, and it's centered on a high school class.  Whoopi Goldberg and Lauryn Hill would be the main female actresses, but all the nuns also count.

Wendy and Lucy:  Story of a homeless young woman who is looking for her lost dog.  

Drop Dead Gorgeous, except for Leslie Miller and a brief flirtation scene with Kirsten Dunst's character and a guy that doesn't amount to anything, because circumstances.

Now and Then: two of the four main characters are never seen doing anything with guys, either as preteens or as adults.  One of them is especially known for being flirtatious but you don't see her engage in any romantic behavior on screen.

School of Rock.  Nothing except a little bit of flirtation between the headmistress (Joan Cusack) and the guy without a shirt, but you don't know if it goes anywhere afterwards.  She seemed a bit clueless about it.

"You gotta do you, man! And I mean that. I've gone years between dates even, because finding a relationship just to be dating someone wasn't my priority at the time. And you are correct, losing weight is directly related to how you eat and how you move. That's the case for every living thing on this planet. Long term results require long term changes.

If cardio is something you enjoy, that's great! There are a lot of really fun options out there. You might find, though, that you can get more out of the cardio if you supplement with weight training. For example, I want to be able to run a mile in a not laughable amount of time one day, but I have a lot of pain in my knees from an old injury. So with my doctor's advice and a trainer's help, I do exercises to develop strength in my knees, keeping them more stable and reducing the pain. It works!

As for the science classes taking up your time, I'm not entirely sure how my boyfriend got a science PhD while also spending hours in the gym. Honestly sounds like he didn't sleep for five years to me, poor man. That's definitely not for everyone. But to him, it was important to make his training a priority, and it still is.

"For reference, I'm 22 and a dude from California. From my experience the people who seem most manly are those that just pursue self improvement and dont let others opinions deter them from their course. The way this may manifest would be taking care of your body and not shying away from people that might think you look ridiculous in the process like you mentioned you've been doing.Good job btw. That is not easy to do and has huge amounts of benefit. You are the lord of your own body but not of others. For me, I try to always listen and be positive to others if they are being comfortable enough to speak to you. Manliness for me is really just about being myself and helping others to do the same. Just respect and love everyone and most people will reciprocate. It really sounds like you're on the right path, especially since you're asking these questions. Keep going! If you want to message and have a lengthy conversation id definitely be open to that. It's difficult to just outright say what makes someone a successful adult. At least for me anyways.",AskReddit,0

"When I was 26 I was broke and desperate and took a night shift moving boxes at one of the UPS distribution centers for $ 8.25/hour. The first night they had the temp workers waiting outside in the cold for a half hour before they let us in, and you have to go through a metal detector. Then they gave us a tour of the building, which was dark, noisy, crowded, and dangerous.  We had to sit in a circle in a classroom and tell everyone what our career aspirations were, which is just demeaning when everyone knows we are just pieces of meat there to unload trucks. They warned us that anyone who misses work during the 'probationary' period is blacklisted from ever working for UPS again, no excuses. Two hours later they sent us home and told us to come back every day for a week, from 5:00-7:00, which is of course rush hour, so I had to leave an hour early to go about 5 miles. The next day my car wouldn't start so I walked a couple miles to a rental place, but they wouldn't give me a car without a credit card. So I rented a 16 ft box truck, which for some reason didn't require a credit card. Again, I was desperate for a job, any job, and thought it would be worth it.  So I started driving to the UPS facility, got stuck in traffic on the freeway and missed the exit. It took about a half hour to turn back around and get on the right road and I probably spent $10 on gas sitting in traffic.  I knew I'd be late and probably only make about $10 after taxes for the ""work day"", and I felt so frustrated and pissed off that I just said ""fuck this"" and drove home. I'm not the kind of guy to call and make excuses. The next day they called me multiple times to ask if I still wanted to work there, and I told them it was actually costing me money to ""work"" for them, and that according to their own policies they were supposed to blacklist me for not showing up.  Turns out they were bluffing about that and in retrospect it's probably illegal.

What is this longing in our hearts for togetherness?

Is it not the sweetest flower?

Does not this flower of love have the fragrant aroma of fine, fine Diamonds?

Does not the wind love the Dirt?

Is not love not unlike the unlikely not it is unlikened to?

Are you with someone tonight?

Do not question your love?

Take your lover by the hand.

Tame the wild cosmos with a whisper.

Conquer heaven with one intimate caress.
