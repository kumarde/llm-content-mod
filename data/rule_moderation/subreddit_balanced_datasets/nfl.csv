"**TL;DR:**  Type in ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ for proper formatting

Actual reply:

For the 

    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

like you were trying for you need three backslashes, so it should look like this when you type it out

    ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

which will turn out like this

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

The reason for this is that the underscore character (this one \_ ) is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does (this guy \* ).  Since the ""face"" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the ""face"" (this guy (ツ) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first ""\\_"" is just saying ""hey, I don't want to italicize (ツ)"" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol

***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***

Edit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \_italicize\_ or \*italicize\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\_italicize\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\\\_/¯ but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.",nfl,1

Week 8: Redskins 9-7 (they made the playoffs, but were pretty terrible. Jason Campbell was their QB) 

Week 9 Colts 13-3 (the last really good team on the schedule unless you include the Giants)

Week 12: Eagles 8-8 (I can't remember if this was the dream team or not still they were pushovers)

Brees has better numbers but throws way more, so I don't think you can say that--at this point in their careers--he's better than Russell. And I'd say the same about Rivers. Luck is an anomaly with his reputation based on his potential and the dude that he hadn't been for a year and a half, and Wilson has better stats.

That's three dudes that we will all agree are better than Wilson. And the youngest of them is like five or six years older than him. And then four dudes who are close enough that it's debatable. So basically, Wilson is at the very least top 10 caliber, and realistically probably top 5. You said he's not one of the best. Then what is he?",nfl,0
"Yeah, PFF is terrible at grading DBs and Oline. I prefer to use the standard method of interceptions and tackles for my dbacks, and did an analysis say they were good for my olinemen.

I also love watching all offensive snaps from every team every week on order to gauge how good each lineman truly is. 

Pff may be flawed, but they're still the best out there. It's not their fault that there is very little competition for statistical analysis at those positions. If you have a better way to statistically track performance in a way that is easy for people to digest, go for it, because there is a lot of money to be made there",nfl,0

I describe him similar to those poor souls drafted by the lions in the early to mid 2000s that never had a chance because Matt Millen never invested in that o-line.

"One guy getting all those touchdowns is the biggest thing. The Dolphins are dealing with Jarvis Landry now and the ability to get in the end zone is ultimately what matters. Being the best at catching 15 yard passes at midfield doesn't make an all-time receiver. 

The fact that if you're within about 60 yards of the endzone, it's possible that you can score on any given bomb. Moss is one of a kind. He can run a fly route playing for any team and with any quarterback and playing against any defense. You can know what's coming but he'll get 180 yards and 2 touchdowns. His peaks with Minnesota and New England are higher than anyone after Jerry Rice. 

Marvin is right up there - it doesn't take anything away from him. I think he's one of the best at the job of being a professional wide receiver, closer to what Jerry Rice is. They are just on point in technique and football IQ but aren't physically extraordinary. Marvin benefited a lot from the connection he built with Peyton, which is ultimately a commendation. I think we'll see another Marvin Harrison but we might not see another Randy Moss.

"As a Jets fan, for me it was beating the Patriots in the post season. They were the 1st seed team that year and had a first round bye in the playoffs. So, they had 2 weeks to rest, prepare and practice for this game against the Jets. And Pats had home field advantage.

Not to mention, the last time we played the Pats that year during the regular season, they punished us 45-3.

So, we got into the playoffs, had to go to Indy to face Manning who beat us the AFC Championship game before. Then had to march into Foxborough to play the Pats, and to our surprise we beat them and made it to the 2nd AFC Championship game that year.

The look on Brady's face when he realized there was no chance of winning was priceless. He looked at the scoreboard like he had just seen a ghost.

That was basically our Super Bowl.",nfl,0

"It was sort of the very end of a dynasty, and though the Cowboys made the NFCCG the following year, that was strike ridden year in which nothing actually made sense and everything fell apart. 

What everyone forgets about the catch though is that it wouldn't have happened if Montana didn't overthrow Solomon who was WIDE OPEN on the play before by 5 feet. There used to be a shot of it which showed Walsh's face after calling that play and watching a young Montana get flustered by how open Solomon actually got, and it was funny. 

Walsh sort of looks at Montana with a face I can only compare to what Holmgren would give Favre, except much more ferocious and not as animated. 

But Montana pulled it all together on the most broken play imaginable. That play was supposed to be identical to what happened at the 9 ish minute mark where Montana hits Solomon. Sprint Right Option is the call, where Clark breaks inside and uses himself + the man covering him to cause a natural pick to spring Solomon open. Since Solomon lines up behind the LOS, he stutters and runs a flat route right behind where Clark is, so he uses Clark as the natural pick and it requires no risk of an OPI call. Difference is Solomon had come in motion the first time Walsh called it, but slipped and fucked the timing of everything while out of the slot position. Clark didn't actually intend on finishing his route-called a Pick-Slide in the WCO, where he picks the inside guy and slides right back out on the back of the end zone . After all, he had never done so before because the pick worked 99% of the time (actually, this play is still run left and right by the Patriots, Packers, Giants, etc). When Clark the first part of his route and didn't hear the usual cheer which followed Solomon's TD, he remembered Montana muttering ""Dwight be ready"", who was just reluctantly channeling Walsh's last instructions before sending in the play (reluctantly, because I can't emphasize enough how ridiculous Walsh must have sounded for suggesting Clark finish his route when it had never mattered before). So Clark had a sort of ""Oh fuck, I'm actually gonna get the ball I better run my route"" moment and luckily it worked out, all while Montana had some of the best LB's in Cowboys history pummeling down on him.
