"/u/thephoton's answer is correct, but CPU clocks work on the order of GHz, not KHz.

Quartz crystals oscillate in the 10's of MHz range very accurately, but this isn't high enough frequency for modern computers. We can also create tuneable RLC oscillators called VCO (voltage controlled oscillators) which can work at very high frequency, but they're sensitive to the input voltage and not all that accurate. 

However, by dividing the VCO output by some factor, and comparing to an accurate crystal oscillator, we can ""lock"" our VCO to a multiple of the crystal frequency. This is done using a feedback loop called a phase-locked loop (PLL).",askscience,1
"In everyday life it doesn't. Sure there's a small probability you might phase through your couch, but this possibility is SO small that we ignore it because it will just never happen. 

With your example of the coin toss, your question could be taken as: is there a small possibility that the result of the coin toss could be decided by the uncertain location/momentum of the particles, and disagree with what classical physics would predict given the speed, angular momentum, force of the flip, etc etc. The answer is no. There are just so many molecules that there is no way that quantum effects would make any difference. Even if by some small chance one metal atom changed from an arrangement that would lead to ""heads"" instead of ""tails"", the rest of the atoms would continue on the path to a ""tails"" result and we would see no difference.

That is not to say that we can't force it to have an effect. This is the thought experiment of Schrödinger's cat: where a macroscopic state (dead/alive) of the cat is determined by a microscopic state (has the radioactive atom decayed, released a particle, and caused the release of the poison gas yet). The state of the cat is then determined by the wavefunction of the particle (a mathematical expression that contains all information that can be known about the particle in question). Prior to our observation of the cat, the wavefunction is dispersed, and we're not sure if the cat is dead or alive. But when we look in the box and find out if the cat is alive or not, then we have forced the wave function to ""spike"": to take a certain position on if it had radioactively decayed or not. 

What does this mean for the birth of the universe/determinism? I'm honestly not sure. The physics is far beyond my ability level, and I'll be reading the comments as eagerly as you in the hopes that a theoretical physicist can explain how quantum mechanics could have an effect on such high energy processes as the big bang. I suspect they'll tell us that the high energy nature of the particles (which usually eliminates quantum effects) at times near the big bang are counteracted by the very small nature of the subatomic broth that was bubbling around. Again, this is totally beyond me and I could be entirely wrong.

As far as philosophy goes, I've given this a fair amount of thought as well, and I have to agree with Kant's view. Here's the gist of one of his examples. You have an election with candidates Gandhi and Hitler, and voter ""Elliot"". We have three scenarios. 
1) Elliot goes and votes for Hitler of his/her own free will. We can all agree that Elliot made a terrible moral decision. 
2) Elliot *intends* to vote for Gandhi, but Hitler installed a mind control device and forced (determined) that Elliot would vote for Hitler instead. I think we can all agree that this is not Elliot's fault, and no blame should be cast (unless you're a utilitarian, in which case we have bigger issues.)
3) Elliot *intends* to vote for Hitler, yet Hitler still uses his mind control device to force (determine) Elliot to vote for him. Here's the big question: **Is Elliot still morally reprehensible for this decision??**

Kant (and I, but that's far less noteworthy), say ""Yes, Elliot is still at fault despite the fact that determinism forced the result."" Moral of the story: it doesn't matter if determinism decides our actions or not, we must still function in the world as if it didn't. 

**TLDR:** No, quantum effects do not make changes in everyday, macroscopic life. However, we can force them to have effects (Schrödinger's Cat). Some think this occurring at the birth of the universe is the end of determinism. Ethically it makes no difference, so don't worry about it.",askscience,1

"Good points all!

> but they aren't geologists 

Irrelevant.  Instead, are they actually right?  That's the only real issue.  Also, isn't it glaringly obvious that the people opening up this new field are required *not to be geologists?*  The topic is new discoveries in extremophile biology/biochem.  Geologists, inorg chemists are untrained and incompetent by definition (unless of course they're fairly recently minted, specializing in the new, expanding geo/bio field, hot-caves bio research, ""deep-mine bacteria,"" hotsprings bio, etc.)

Yes, my answer isn't written by a geologist.  That's specifically why I have flair: so there's no mistake.   Really my area of expertise is to drum up love/fascination of science by digging into current controversies.  There's an entire audience out there who falls in love with science *not* when it appears as a perfect source of truth, but instead, when it's embarrassing flaws are exposed.  Genesis of ores is exactly one of these little-known hot topics, a David/Goliath situation, and an opportunity for new PhDs to get in on a ground floor.  The small rebel band, the new field of extremophile biology against the ""petrified"" beliefs of the entire geo community.   Which side is actually right?  At one time the question was completely settled.   Today, no longer.

> on matters of geology is really dubious.

Heh, I'll give you that one.  But no mention of Margulis, or the Dark-Life book?  :)   Actually the main field of these scientists is *maverick research*, to seek out and work on genuine, breakthrough topics which specifically tweak the nose of ""the establishment.""   Against immense barriers of disbelief, Margulis founds the entire symbiogenesis field, then goes on to develop strong opinions about environmental biological feedback loops, and deep underground biosphere, even though the evidence clearly forbade such things at the time.   Then, piece by piece, all the contrary evidence is shown to be wrong, and solid textbook knowledge is slowly being revised.

Here's the brief history I've seen, each point controversial in its day.

Metal deposits cannot possibly be biological because...  
1. Life can't be based on reducing chemistry.  Wrong, shot down ~70? years back.
2. The cycle of life always requires solar input.  Wrong, finally killed off in the 1980s via hot springs research, chemosynthetic living communities.
3. Bacteria can't survive miles underground; mines are sterile.  Wrong, via amazing hyperthermophile discoveries in the last two decades.  ""Deep mine bacteria.""
4. Various metal ions are guaranteed toxic to bacteria, so they're not a ""food source.""  Wrong, discovery of gold-nugget and other bacteria, uranium-fixers.

What's left?  5. The geology community doesn't accept biological role in deep geochemistry.

Is it controversial?  Very.   Is it my own invention?  Hardly.

This also happens with sex segregation, where individuals from one gender spend the majority of their life in the ocean and the other gender spends the majority of their life in a freshwater system. Marine fish are vastly more harvested than freshwater, so the gender population residing in the ocean will be lowered much more than the other, resulting in gender ratio disparity also.

Usually we go look in the scree fields near old mines and we can find various semi-precious gems that we can polish.

Some of the mines mined copper and some of them disposed of uranium ore as an unwanted byproduct - for example the Copper King Mine and the Copper Bug Mine (later the Prairie Divide Uranium Mine) but even if they weren't actual real uranium mines, there is a lot of uranium around here.

"> I think a more likely explanation is that the brain is confusing these patients. Normally the brain signals if something is important for you, or interesting and you will try to fit this in your worldview. It could be that these people their brains are constantly telling them something is important, and in order to fit all this into your worldview you would have to come up with ridiculous theories.

This has always made sense to me too. An important job of the brain is to take a confusing array of sensory input and create a coherent narrative out of it. It's not hard to see how this could go awry and, like you say, cause certain cues to be mis-weighted. From dealing with a friend who suffers from schizophrenia, it seemed like above all else, he lacked that undefinable gut instinct that allows us to separate a plausible scenario from something that just can't be true. I found that a lot of his delusions were actually somewhat plausible to somebody who didn't know the situation. Neighbors talking shit is something that happens every day. But then when I learned more about the situation I started to realize something was off, and that what he was saying just couldn't be true. Interestingly, it also seemed to work the other way. The first symptom I ever noticed (and I had been friends with him since before his schizophrenia developed) was that he became extremely skeptical about anything I said, even if it wasn't something that somebody would ever lie about. I casually mentioned a story about how a truck crashed at a rotary near my house a few years ago and damaged a house and he seemed almost offended that I would try to get him to believe such a story. I thought he was just busting my balls but I got the same reaction to two other completely ordinary, believable stories. It seems like one thing that is 'mis-weighted' in the case of classic paranoid schizophrenia is the sense that somebody else is deceiving you. It's a delicate instinct we've evolved to avoid getting tricked by others but some people just have it dialed up too strong, and it must be terrifying to live like that.

It's *extremely* interesting, from a social perspective.  For example, if some populations are naturally genetically smarter than others, we can finally put to bed the idea that achievement gaps are mainly due to socioeconomic factors or historical injustices.  It would also be obvious that we're doing a disservice to different groups by educating them together--either the education will be less challenging than the smarter group is (on average) able to handle, or too challenging (on average) for the dumber group to be able to handle, and it would also mean that if decided to widely practice ability grouping in our schools, that some groups being over-represented or some being underrepresented is *exactly what we'd expect.*  ",askscience,1

"Sound waves are really our perception of vibrations in our medium (air). To do this over long distances would require a lot of mechanical energy to create the vibration, then there is the issue of making the vibrations at a frequency we cant hear and that won't affect animals with different hearing ranges. Can you imagine if we were capable of ""hearing"" every wireless signal passing by? Life would be a never ending cacophony. Finally, consider that our current wireless technology uses electromagnetic waves that move at the speed of light and pass through most mediums unchanged. By unchanged I mean the signal amplitude and frequency remain the same, but the intensity of the signal may diminish (only some of the waves that hit a metal wall will pass through and many will be reflected, but the ones that pass through are unchanged unless we are talking about red and blue shifting which only happens under circumstances that are pretty negligible in this application on earth). The problem with sound is that it's a mechanical vibration of the air, and it moves very slow compared to Electromagnetic radiation and also diminishes very quickly. Something as simple as a sound passing from air into water will chance the vibration so much. Think of trying to hear someone talk to you when you are underwater. How can we reliably use that to pass information and keep it intact?!

To take it to the extreme, think of the cars as lego blocks. If you moved 100 blocks at speed individually, they would experience 1 arbitrary unit of drag each, but if you stuck them all together in a long line, the block on the front experiences slightly more than half the resistance it would have otherwise. Same story for the block on the other end. All the blocks in the middle experience much less. If you allow them to push each other, which can happen in real racing, they can go much faster.

"http://www.plasma-universe.com/Plasma#Temperatures

Temperatures

A candle flame. Fire can be considered to be a low temperature partial plasma.

Plasma temperature is commonly measured in Kelvin or electron volts, and is (roughly speaking) a measure of the thermal kinetic energy per particle. In most cases the electrons are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even when there is a significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium among themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionized technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.

Based on the relative temperatures of the electrons, ions and neutrals, plasmas are classified as thermal or non-thermal. Thermal plasmas have electrons and the heavy particles at the same temperature i.e. they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. Non thermal plasmas on the other hand have the ions and neutrals at a much lower temperature (normally room temperature) whereas electrons are much ""hotter"".

Temperature controls the degree of plasma ionization. In particular, plasma ionization is determined by the electron temperature relative to the ionization energy (and more weakly by the density) in accordance with the Saha equation. A plasma is sometimes referred to as being hot if it is nearly fully ionized, or cold if only a small fraction (for example 1%) of the gas molecules are ionized (but other definitions of the terms hot plasma and cold plasma are common). >>>>Even in a ""cold"" plasma the electron temperature is still typically several thousand degrees Celsius.<<<< Plasmas utilized in plasma technology (""technological plasmas"") are usually cold in this sense.

You can see it in a bandwidth chart like a slope up and then a sudden cliff as everything backs off at the same time.

You probably won't notice this at home except in the case of torrenting. Keep in mind the up/down can be happening at less than 1 second intervals. Depends on a lot of factors.

Random early detection starts dropping packets before total congestion, keeping average throughput higher - because not everything slows down at the same time.

This is just the design of TCP to use more and more bandwidth until packets start dropping. A super basic way to make it efficient. Designed in a bygone time before the Internet.

"Let's make some assumptions, and do some math. 

22c is 71.6 freedom units. 

Assuming climate zone 5 (Chicago) the 1% temp is about 2 freedom units or -16.66c for our communists friends out there. That is what the C stands for, right? 

Assuming code required insulation for a 10'x10'x10' (3 meters) would put r-49 ceiling, r-21 walls, r-30 floor, u-.35 3'x4'window, u-.4 door 3'x7'. These are typical residential requirements but may be different in less free areas. 

Now, this is going to be tight construction but not air tight, so you have to account for infiltration between the little cracks and holes in wood. At the typical tight rate of .21 air changes per hour for our 1000 cubic foot cube gives us some like 4cfm. Doesn't seem like much... but it is. 

Using a manual J calculation program (fancy code required heat loss calculator)

We get :
walls - 1670btu/hr
roof - 203
floor - 259
window - 336
door - 573
air infiltration - 263 more than the roof and almost as much as the dang window! yikes!

total= about 3,300 btu/hr to keep a 10x10 cube with standard insulation levels at 71.6f when it is 2f outside. 

3300/3.41s = 967 watts or so. per hour. 

Now if we want to compare that to our friends passive haus standard over the pond in germany, they recommend enough insulation for 10 watts per square meter.  

As you can see 90watts is a lot less than 900, but they also use things like r-60 walls and u-.16 quadruple pane super windows instead of the wimpy freedom powered r-20. The insulation question and assumption is critical to answering your question quantitatively. 

Two 12v car batteries at 40amp-hours (not deep cycle) should be able to put out 40x12x2= 960 watts. That is assuming your inverter is 100% efficient which it is not. Not that it matters because the batteries just store energy...

""How long would i have to cycle for to charge them?""

One human doing 250 watts of work...

So- if your room is american and in chicago, you can never charge the batteries if the heater is using 960 watts every hour even if your generator was 100% efficient in turning human energy into battery energy, and your inverter/heater was 100% efficient in turning it back. Yes you make heat and energy, but the room will not be 22c. 

So- if you are in germany and using r-60 passive house levels of crazy insulation, and only need 90 watts per hour to keep the thing warm... 90x24= 2160 watts per day... so if you can ride a bike at 250 watts you would only have to ride 8.6 hours per day!

Note: I am assuming 100% efficiency on batteries, invertsers, generators, and humans, and nobody ever opens the door. Also assuming your alternator idea is spinning at the correct rpm to generate full power. We know that aint true but it is a place to start. 

""Is it worth doing"" - 

I don't know, man, maybe to you?

""would i be exhausted for little result?"" - You know, a single 250w solar panel could inefficiently heat that tiny room if it was insulated correctly. Attach it to a heat pump and you would have a coefficient of performance 2-3x that electric resistance heater. Those one time expenses would be cheaper than all the food you needed to eat to pedal a bike 8 hours a day. 

Note: factoring in solar might give you 700-800btu over the course of the day, barely an hours worth. A sunny day might reduce your needed heating to 0 for a time, but once the sun goes down you are back at it. And if it is cloudy you might want enough heat. 

Hope that answers it for you!

"time is relative.  simplest answer.  time is relative.  
&nbsp;  

The closer you get to the speed of light C, the slower everything becomes around you in perspective.  Why? well what you observe is light so if you reach the speed of light you are now traveling as fast as everything can be observed.  If you follow a hummingbird at a hummingbirds speed the humming bird is stationary its no longer moving away from you in either direction.  If you are faster you are pulling away from the hummingbird.  So if you travel at the speed of light you see the light as stationary in essence everything has stopped.  if you stop to observe, well now you aren't traveling at the speed of light and it is pulling away, as it pulls away from you time in essence moves.  
&nbsp;  
  if you are traveling at the speed of frame 10, all you ever see is frame 10 in a movie. you don't see the entire movie until you have observed all the frames.  If you travel at the same speed as 1 frame and only witness 1 frame then you are seeing only 1 frame as if the entire movie has frozen in time.

Funny thing is, if their research was valid, there's something called an ovonics cell, which crams a bunch of hydrogen together in a nickel hydride cell in a high current environment. If you've got a car/vehicle full of these things, and cold fusing occurs, whoops! BOOM! 

Maybe that's why they really never made it to market. ;) Which I suppose would make the effect less than worthless. 

Regular old hot fusion, I think the biggest problem is you never know what will scale. You build it, run it, and find out that instead of a tokomak, you need a reactor that looks more like a barrel of snakes. Great, we'll just pull that 40 billion out of healthcare, sure nobody will notice. ;)  But sometimes people got lucky, like with the Z-pinch machine, they figured out all sorts of crazy ways to push the capabilities of that hardware. And from what they learned, more in abilities to kludge existing hardware, some of that might be able to be built into experimental fusion reactors. 

Now things like ITER, god help em if they got that sucker wrong, it's gonna be one super expensive piece of ""modern sculpture"". Kind of the way the super collider in texas is. Cultures 15 centuries down the line are gonna be wondering what the hell that thing was all about. lol! So, maybe its for the best that things are going slow.

"From the technical point of view vinyl has much lower sound quality, but in the real world the vinyl version very often sounds better. This is because of a different, better vinyl master.

Stupid people think a louder recording makes more profit. So the recordings in the time period from 1995 to now were “optimized” to be loud. As the recording has no access to the volume control the only way to make a recording louder is by lowering the dynamics. It is called loudness war and almost all recordings including almost all genres were mastered with poor dynamics. The vinyl can not be made from a master with such low dynamics, because the needle would jump out of the track using such a master. Therefore an extra vinyl master is made which often sounds better.

Furthermore,  a Google search will show that the spontaneous shattering of glass is not,  but any means,  an isolated incident,  but is in fact a very well documented phenomenon.

"Yes, the force of gravity is proportional to mass, but the force of gravity is independent of an object's acceleration (or close to it) for an object on earth. As the net force of an object that's falling is equal to the force of gravity (neglecting air resistance), the formula for the acceleration of that object is Fg=ma, or the force of gravity causes a mass to accelerate. Now the force of gravity is equal to be mass times g, so mg=ma therefore g=a. The gravitational pull doesn't matter at all. You can extend this to any object for simple gravitation between two objects, as the formula for the acceleration of an object anywhere where there is a relatively large mass nearby is m1a=(Gm1m2/r^2). The acceleration is therefore independent of the mass of the falling object mass, as a=(Gm2/r^2), which does not include the mass of the falling object.

There are multiple families of stinging insects, most of which contain proteins that have significantly higher allergenic potential and properties than say.. an ant bite. The only surefire way to know whether you'd react to a different insect family is to be tested. Wasps have different proteins than bees and sweat bees and mud daubers for example. Without getting too specific, what it boils down to is the specific protein that's eliciting a response. Just like food, without knowing the protein that causes the reaction, and whether that protein is shared in the venom of X species there isn't really a scientific way to answer that question.",askscience,1

Since this has mass it is firts of all missing from the earth's mass and second of all also exerts its own gravitational pull. This means that the gravity before the rain is ever so slightly weaker than after it. But this is very very small and therefore completely irrelevant and also probably not what you wanted to know.


Also for starters, gravity is a force that two objects with mass exert at each other. It is calculated as

F=G* (m1*m2)/r^2

m1 and m2 are here the two masses

r is the distance between there center if masses

G is the gravitational constant

"It's actually a result of two different visual phenomena interacting. On one hand you have the classic false dots illusion caused by the intersections of the grey lines with one another. On the other, you have the black dots disappearing as a result of them being far enough apart that focusing on a few dots renders the rest of them in your periphery, making them not visible.

Your brain then combines the two effects, so focusing on one dot makes it be clear, dots about one away will flicker as your eyes twitch about ever so slightly, and dots further away will not be visible at all. When your brain figures out that white dots shouldn't be present, it ends up removing some of the black dots as a result because of where they lie on the pattern.

Moving away from the image causes the periphery effect to become more present, and moving closer will let you see all the dots at once, because the false white dots effect won't be present. So there's a sweet spot in the middle of the two distances where it really messes with your head.",askscience,1

"Ha! Time to chip in to provide a ELI15 version:

Everyone knows League of Legends and DotA. Ah, the sweet sweet heroin disguised as a video game. The addiction that creates impulsive reactions and mostly negative feelings towards the people you play with.

Why am I using them as an example? Well, because it's easier to grasp the fundamentals of learning.

For example, there is this rank ""Silver"" in League, which holds for the biggest amount of playerbase. It's not all that good, but it's where the most casual and ignorant players stand in. One specific individual-type always shines through, ""The Rager"".

The Rager does not see the true reasons behind his prolonged stay at the Silvermoon Inn. He always blames others for why he is there, bathing in narcissism. Because hey, it's easier to shrug it off stating others fuck up, instead of doing the work of getting better.

This is for example, where I'm stuck with maths at the moment. I'm not blaming the books for being shitty though. But I can't connect the dots with ""Why is this done so, and what can be done to solve the next problem"". This is half my own ignorance towards the topic, and half of not knowing stuff.

At some point, for reason or another, you reach the point of critical evaluation. You start to evaluate your own doings.

""Hey, I have no items, I wonder why. Oh, because I chase kills like an idiot and not farm the minions, which are the main source of money in the game. I must practise that more"" Is the equivalent of me ignoring of doing math that would make solving certain problems a routine.

The more base you get aka the higher you get in rank, the more you understand about the game, and the more information you are able to consume and implement about it, because YOU KNOW, what to look for.

**TL;DR Completely useless anecdote on learning and videogames. The more you understand about the topic, the easier for you it is to look for the right information, help, and a solution**

"> Can we plot absolute locations in timespace? 

Chapter 1 of [Misner, Thorne and Wheeler's book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation_(book)) is very interesting in that it describes spacetime not as a mere set of coordinates of space and time, but instead as a set of *events* (""set"" in the mathematical sense, as an ensemble of all possible values, like the numbers set). In this sense, two events (which we can call ""start"" and ""finish"") are elements of that set. And like you can **describe** elements of a set differently depending on your **choice** of coordinates without changing the elements of the set (the events are the **same**!), you can switch from one system of coordinates to another without changing the events -- what changes is how **describe** the events in the new coordinate system, and investigate how to transform the description from one coordinate system to another.

> Can we accurately predict the exact location of the Earth in one year?

Yes because the universe behaves in a **predictable** way, it follows **laws**. Here the term ""law"" is not used in the sense that ""it **must** forcefully observe this behavior *or else*"", but rather in the sense that ""every experiment and observation we tried has always behaved in this specific way concerning these measured quantities"". *That* regularity in the behavior of nature is what is used to make predictions.

> it seems like there would be an awful lot of variables to consider if we were trying to determine coordinates of a celestial body 

Relative to what other celestial body? What exactly are you trying to *do*?

In sciences you don't try to complicate things unnecessarily. Instead you **simplify**. So you don't have to make it unnecessarily complicated *unless you have to*. If for your work it is sufficient to look into how the Earth moves around the Sun (for example to launch a probe from here to the Moon), then you won't need to include the motion of the Sun in the Milky Way or our Galaxy's motion in the Local System.

> in science fiction time travel. 

Oh ok. 

Firstly, we don't know yet how to do it, let alone if it's at all technologically possible. But regardless of that, if you choose a given coordinate system (*and you pick the one where your calculations are easiest*) then you use it. You won't complicate the problem unless it's absolutely necessary to do so.

> If you were displaced in spacetime, you would have to account for the entire universe in your journey.

I think I'm starting to see what you're trying to get at. 

When you pick a coordinate system, it's always a *local* system. That's because you always try to make your work as easiest as possible! For example, you can pick the origin of the coordinate system at starting event. You ""place"" the axes of your coordinate system right on the starting event, and if it's important you include other perturbations then you do so. But if the perturbations are not very important (i.e. they're always below a certain tolerance) then you just calculate as if they weren't there. You only put in the things that you cannot do without! You only have so much time and patience to work with...",askscience,1

"In theory yes, but I think this point was overgeneralized. There are two primary ""pain response mechanisms"". One is called Allodynia, which essentially means non-painful stimuli (like light touch) can cause severe pain: think about a time you've burned your finger and then even grabbing something normally hurts. The other is hyperalgesia, or exaggerated feelings of pain. If you stub your toe twice in one day, the second time is REALLY going to hurt.

The reason I bring this up is that localized allodynia and hyperalgesia are common and usually disperse after some time (acute pain). Damage to nerves or persistent painful stimuli or even malfunction in the communication network can lead to chronic allodynia and or hyperalgesia. when other posts have referred to ""destroyed nerves"" they likely mean those that are malfunctioning.

**BB radius** | 10.8 | cm
**marble mass** | 1.31 | g | 0.00131 | kg
**marble radius** | 0.5 | cm

bowling ball parameters were derived from regulations on weight and diameter. Marble mass was derived from assuming 1cm diameter sphere of solid glass with typical density.

A lot of fuss has been made about the fact that the two will orbit their mutual center of mass, but what's not getting mentioned enough is where that center of mass is. The fact is that if the ratio between the two masses is small enough, the larger mass can be treated as a fixed body and error remains marginal. In this case, our bodies have a mass ratio of ~5542. I.e. the bowling ball weighs ~5542 times as much. So for my calculations i'll be assuming the Bowling ball is fixed. I'll note the distance of the real CoM from the bowling ball's center in each case.

So lets get some math up here in this joint:

 | | | | | |
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Orbit radius (cm) | 11.4 | 21.6 | 32.4 | 100 | 651.6
CoM (cm from BB center) | 0.002056654 | 0.003896818 | 0.005845226 | 0.018040822 | 0.117553995
CoM error (% of bowling ball radius) | 0.01904309 | 0.036081644 | 0.054122466 | 0.167044647 | 1.088462917
Grav accel (cm/s^2) | 3.72836E-06 | 1.03853E-06 | 4.6157E-07 | 4.84538E-08 | 1.14121E-09
Orbit speed (cm/s) | 0.006519459 | 0.004736277 | 0.003867154 | 0.002201223 | 0.00086233

Orbit period (days) |  |  |  | 3.303711473 | 54.95076273

The first orbit has the marble orbiting such that there's only 1 mm of space between the bowling ball's surface and the marble's surface, about as close as you can get here and still be orbiting. Equivalent orbital altitude for earth would be ~354 km, well into low earth orbit and outside the atmosphere. Even still, the marble would take 3 hours to make a full rotation around the bowling ball.

At one bowling ball radius away from the surface (a relatively low Medium earth orbit) the marble would make a full rotation every 8 hours. At a bowling ball diameter away, this goes to 14 hours. At a full meter away, it takes more than 3 days to make it all the way around. The last experiment in the table shows if the marble were an equivalent distance from the bowling ball as the moon is to earth. At that distance, the marble would only orbit about 6 and a half times per year.

Notably, in almost all of the cases, the actual location of the center of mass for the system is a fraction of a percent off from the bowling ball's center. And by the time we see even a 1% error, our marble is moving 8 micrometers per second, or an average human hair's width ever 10 seconds.

"If you have some function y(x*_1_*,x*_2_*,...,x*_n_*), where the x*_i_* are random variables with associated errors, you can approximate the error in y using a Taylor series expansion. This is typically referred to as *propagation of error*. To lowest order, the variance in y is given by:

`[; \sigma_{y}^2 \approx \sum_{ij} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_j} V_{ij} ;]`,

where V*_ij_* is the covariance matrix and the partial derivatives are evaluated at the *means* of all x*_i_*.

If you're studying uncorrelated random variables, the covariance matrix takes a simple form:

`[; V_{ij} = \sigma^{2}_{i}\ \delta_{ij} ;]`,

so the double sum above simplifies to:

`[; \sigma_{y}^2 \approx \sum_{i} \Big(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_i}\Big)^2 \sigma^{2}_{i} ;]`.

In your case, you've got F(C,B) = 1 - (B/C). So you'd just evaluate:

`[; \sigma_{F}^2 \approx \Big(\frac{\partial F}{\partial C}\Big)^2 \sigma^{2}_{C} + \Big(\frac{\partial F}{\partial B}\Big)^2 \sigma^{2}_{B} ;]`.

So you just have to take two partial derivatives, then plug in your means and uncertainties in C and B, and you'll get an approximate value for the uncertainty in F. All of this assumed that a first-order Taylor series expansion is valid, so that should be kept in mind.",askscience,0

"&gt; But how much does it take to actually affect the equilibrium of an object in an unstable Lagrange point?

&gt; but how much displacement would it take to affect the ship's equilibrium? Is it in the order of the meter? Kilometer? Megameter?

There is no threshold. *Any* perturbation, no matter how small, will be enough to take it out of equilibrium. That's why they're called unstable. Moreover, we cannot even put them there and wait for a perturbation to happen because man-made machines are imperfect: as soon as we put a satellite in L1 or L2 it is already destabilized.

So, in order to quantify the unstability of these points, we need a different metric. Fortunately we have it: *how much delta-v will a spacecraft need to keep itself in L1?* The answer is nearly the same as it would need to compensate for drag in low Earth orbit (LEO), which is around 30 m/s per year. So it's not terribly unstable. [Some spacecraft in a halo orbit around L1, such as SOHO, have had so far delta-v yearly costs of less than 1 m/s](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110008638.pdf), so it's even better than LEO.

"they are hot due to the low density because they almost never collide with each other, and so they can't exchange kinetic energy, which means particles have a hard time slowing down. however remember that electrons radiate photons when they are accelerated.  an electron don't need to collide with a proton to accelerate, it only needs to graze it.

it's certainly less bright than stars in terms of average surface brightness, but keep in mind that there is much MUCH more gas, and because the gas is transparent we always observe them through the line of sight, this means that when we look at one point in the cluster, we're actually looking at ALL the photons emitted by the cluster from the point all the way through the volume of the cluster. so when we look at an image like [this](https://www-xray.ast.cam.ac.uk/xray_introduction/abell2029_comp.jpg), we're actually looking at the photons released by the entire cluster projected onto a 2-D image.  nothing is obfuscated.

"Taken from an answer of mine in a similar question:

Let's start with the fundamental question: how can a mathematical structure exist, such that given two numbers or ""keys"" and an algorithm, performing the algorithm with one number can ""undo"" what performing the algorithm with the second number has done?

In any introductory course in Number Theory, we examine the usual arithmetic operations under [modular arithmetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic). Let's focus a bit on multiplication:

* 2∗4=1 mod7 (2*4 = 8, 8/7 = 1 remainder 1)
* 5∗3=1 mod7 (5*3 = 15, 15/7 = 2 remainder 1)

Here we have two values, 2 &amp; 5, multiplied with two different values, 4 &amp; 3, leading to the same result modulo 7: 1. Finding the multiplication inverse modulo N is hard: how can we go back to 2 from 1 mod 7? Let's try more modular multiplications:

* 6∗3 = 4 mod 7
* 4∗5 = 6 mod 7

Oh, what's this? It seems like we've come up with a way to go from 6 ""back"" to 6, by multiplying with different numbers. It turns out, this is a way to create such mathematical structures which are useful in PKC.

---

Up next, let's take a contrived version of [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem\)) as an example, together with a large integer N, say 200 digits long. N is composite, which means it is the product of two prime numbers, which we will call `p` and `q`. We will perform all mathematical operations in modulo N, so we might refer to N as the ""modulus"" as well. This system has some properties which are interesting:

1. It is very easy to compute powers modulo N, like so: `m^(3) mod N`
2. we can choose `p` and `q` appropriately so that no two integers `mod N` have the same cube, or otherwise put, all integers in `[0, n)` have a unique cube root `mod N`. This is a hard one to visualise, but try to for a small N.
3. computing the cube root of any integer `mod N` is very hard, compared to #1
4. if we know `p` and `q`, computing the cube root `mod N` becomes easy
5. given N, we don't know of efficient ways to compute `p` and `q` ([factorisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization))

In this example, `N` is a piece of information which can be made public, and `p`/`q` information which if disclosed, make it very easy for other parties to perform arithmetic in our system. The idea is, therefore, that RSA is sort of like a (computationally) one-way function for all parties except the one who selected the keys. The particulars are more complex, of course.

How does organic matter on earth bury to hydrocarbon gen depths? A process of crust thinning, dense mantle replacement and sedimentary deposition on top. Mars has a less dense mantle, so the thinning effect is even less than on earth, yet it needs to be greater.

If by some other mechanism Mars did make some oil, there is no reason why it wouldn't be there now. It could sit in a confined aquifer forever.

"&gt; why are you trying to use gallium as a heat carrier? 

I bet his thought-process went as follows:

""Let's go with liquid cooling. (Insert step here about why he doesn't want to use conventional materials such as water or oil.)  Liquid metals have lower thermal resistance. Mercury is highly toxic, so let's avoid that. The next lowest meling point for a metal is gallium at 29, so it could be used. It will be shiny, cool (as in interesting), and cool (as in not being overheated).""

To the OP: Don't use gallium.  I can think of about 8million things that could possibly go wrong or things that would make your life a living hell.  Outside of ~~possible~~ probable corrosion issues, you also have to deal with the fact that your coolant is going to solidify when you turn the computer off, and that when you turn it back on, your entire coolant loop is going to be clogged with solid gallium until there is enough heat to melt it.  *There is no guarantee that the gallium will melt before the CPU over heats.*  ~~Gallium probably has a higher density as a solid, which means you're going to create pockets of vacuums within the cooling loop when you shut the cooling system off~~. Edit: /u/dzScritches below says that it expands, so this would actually cause one to burst a pipe. The temperature of the gallium far away from the CPU is going to be colder, but you have to keep it above 29 degrees around the entire loop.  To turn the computer on, you'd have to melt your coolant first, and this would be a long and complicated process.  Then, when designing the cooling loop, you have to be certain that nothing ever gets colder than 29 degrees.

Doing a quick check on wikipedia: ""Gallium is corrosive to all metals except tungsten and tantalum, which have a high resistance to corrosion, more so than niobium, titanium and molybdenum.[6]""  So you couldn't even use a copper on the heatsink.

Then there's the issue of why you'd even want to use it in the first place, since metals have lower heat capacities than water.

I definitely would not suggest using gallium as a coolant unless you have at least a bachelor's degree in mechanical or related engineering field, and a lot of spare time to consider every possible problem, and lots of funding for fixing all of the computers you're going to break in the process of figuring out a system that doesn't break your computer.

It took a *lot* of PhDs a *lot* of years to figure out all of the issues with using sodium as a coolant in nuclear reactors (solidifies when the reactor is turned off), and that's with the benefit that sodium can't corrode steel.

"As others have stated, the radii have no width, so they can't be more dense. I'd like to bring up another example that follows your ""condensing together"" idea.

Since radius is just the name we give for that distance, let's call each persons distance from the light post a radius too. Does this mean that there are 1,000 radii clustered together in between the light post and person #1? By the logical in your original question, that's exactly what that means! Of course, what are all these radii doing being more dense in this one meter space? Are they ""thicker"" or are they ""stacked on top of each other?""

Does this analogy make sense? There is an analogous question to the one you're asking about in mathematics and it is (conveniently) also called density.

"Hi! Atmospheric scientist here. I can explain what people mean when they talk about the ""quiet period"".

The last time the U.S. was hit by a major hurricane (defined as category 3 or higher on the wind-based [Saffir-Simpson](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php) scale) was [Wilma](https://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/h2005_wilma.html) in 2005. The U.S. has been hit by destructive hurricanes since then, including Ike, Irene, and Sandy, but these were all either category 1 or 2 when they made landfall. So the ""quiet period of major hurricane activity"" that you are referring to is the 11 year period after Wilma during which no hurricane made landfall on U.S. soil *while at category 3+ intensity*. Matthew has also ended a 9 year period with no [category 5 storms in the Atlantic basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Category_5_Atlantic_hurricanes) - the previous cat 5 storm being Felix in 2007.

Tropical cyclone activity is very complex. It is influenced by planetary-scale oscillations in climate - e.g., [ENSO](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/impacts-el-ni%C3%B1o-and-la-ni%C3%B1a-hurricane-season) (El Nino/La Nina), the [Madden-Julian Oscillation](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/what-mjo-and-why-do-we-care), and some others. Hurricane Matthew is not *in itself* an indicator that we are going to see an increase in tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic in the near future (this year or coming years). You would need to look at the overall conditions that favor hurricane formation (low wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures, overall heat content in the upper ocean, etc.). The relationship between hurricanes and climate variables is receiving a lot of attention, especially in the future as climate change fucks shit up.

That's about the best explanation I can give. After all I don't study hurricanes, I study air quality. Now who wants to hear about ozone formation?!?!? ^Anyone?

"Not quite. I think the question of whether the world is deterministic or not doesn't actually necessarily have to be addressed at all (unless an assumption one way or the other on the part of the person trying to understand probability is what hinders them from understanding things).

Let me maybe try and approach it from a different perspective: People often naively think that probabilities are somehow a property of the external world. Like, the probability of throwing a 1 with a die being a sixth being a property of the process of throwing a die/possibly of the die itself.

Now, that works out just fine in many scenarios, but it's easy to confuse yourself with that approach if you aren't careful in non-trivial cases. Take the monty hall problem, for example: If you think that the probability is a property of the game setup, it's so intuitive that probabilities don't change when one door is opened. Whereas, if you understand probability as uncertainty in knowledge, it's much easier to figure out that it indeed does change, as opening the first door reduces the uncertainty in your knowledge, and therefore changes the probabilities.

That is why I think it is better to only concentrate on the uncertainty in knowledge perspective when explaining the interpretation of probability, and when doing that, to avoid anything that could suggest something else. Now, uncertainty in knowledge is not affected at all by selection of the gif in the OP's scenario (none of the knowledge that's used to derive probabilities before the selection is affected by the selection), which is why the probabilities are not affected by it. Therefore, making any distinction between before selection and after selection is actually irrelevant to the explanation. If you make the distinction anyway, you risk that people ascribe significance to that change in the external world, thus confirming their idea of probability as a property of the external world.

So, it's actually not about whether the world is deterministic or not, but that probability works the same regardless, so you don't need to assume either way in order to explain it, and it's a bad idea to assume one way or the other for didactic reasons.

"The public key and private key are not randomly chosen. They are a pair that are mathematically related.

The plaintext is encrypted using the public key. This encryption utilises mathematical operations that is (relatively ) one way - that is, it is very difficult to work backwards from cipher text to plaintext even if you know the public key.

By contrast the private key *can* be used to decrypt the cipher text easily by running a different set of mathematical operations using it and the cipher text. It's rather like the private key provides a shortcut for decryption.

That's the theory - the tricky part is finding a suitable ""one way"" operation and finding appropriate pairs of numbers for the private and public keys. (and it must also be difficult to deduce the private key from the public key ).

The RSA system uses modular exponentialion as part of the ""one way"" function. The Wikipedia entry on RSA has a worked example that you can follow: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)

"Edit: I'm wrong (as I said I definitely could have been); see the post below mine.

Because the mass of the bowling ball is much, much larger (~7.26kg) than that of the marble (~0.0015kg) we can assume that for all intents and purposes the marble will move toward the bowling ball and the bowling ball will be stationary. 

The acceleration due to gravity for the marble would be G*7.26kg/r^2, with a minimum distance between their centers of mass of about 1 bowling ball radius, or ~10.8cm=0.108m. We would want the average acceleration over the duration of the motion (because it's changing as r decreases), so let's assume an initial distance between their centers of mass of 5 bowling ball radii (or 0.54m), and integrate from r=0.54m to r=0.108m. We then want to divide this by the total distance, 0.432m. We get an average acceleration of -8.308*10^-9 m/s/s.

From the projectile motion for displacement, ∆x=vt-0.5at^2, where v=0 and a=-8.308*10^-9 and ∆x=0.432m. Solve for t, and we get t≈10200 seconds, or about 2.83 hours.

"Yeah a lot of people don't really consider the hurricane/cyclone activity that happens outside of the Gulf/East coast region.

Last year, Hurricane Patricia literally came out of nowhere - tropical storm to Category 5 in 24 hours, and has the strongest sustained winds ever recorded, but possibly faster than the 215mph they got since the plane could not safely continue flying through her. Fortunately, the geography of the coast it hit was a storm killer, so the damage was a lot less than anticipated in Mexico. Texas got hit with flash floods though.",askscience,0

"&gt; I'm a phys student, and I agree, we tend to throw around derivatives and infinitesimals like they're simple arithmetic, when this really isn't the case.

It's worth noting that while the Weierstrassian delta-epsilon definitions are one way to formalize the calculus, it's not the only one. There are formalizations which directly admit infinitesimals. Abraham Robinson's nonstandard analysis is one such approach. While mathematicians often think that physicists are being nonrigorous and sloppy in their use of maths, it's not the case that using infinitesimals must be nonrigorous. There is work to be done and it's a bit more than simple arithmetic, but it can be made fully rigorous.

Jerome Keisler has a freshman calculus textbook which is based upon nonstandard analysis. It's conveniently available for free online at his [website](https://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html) under a Creative Commons license. He also has a companion book, written at the advanced undergraduate level, which goes into more detail than would be appropriate for a freshman-level book. It is also available at his [website](https://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/foundations.html)",askscience,0

"There is a diference between chronic and acute radiation poisoning.  
  
In chronic exposure symptoms are ""stochastic"" meaning random. It's like buying a lottery ticket, you either ""win"" or you don't. Lots of chronic exposure is lots of lottery tickets. Your odds of ""winning"" are more likely. Winning is getting cancer.  
  
Acute exposure is a high dose in a short time. What happens with an short dose is the DNA of the cells gets corrupted and the cell dies or turns malignent, and the body starts trying to clear out the damage. The cells that replicate faster are the most severely affected. The lining of the stomach, hair follicles, skin cells, and bone marrow. You see this in vomiting of blood, blisters, hair falling out, and dead blood cells clogging the liver. The thing that will likely kill a victim of radiation poisoning is hypotic encephalopathy (liver toxicity), asphixia from liquid in the lungs, bacterial infection from the compromised surfaces and compromised immune system from damaged white blood cells.",askscience,0

"In this case *you* are completely incorrect.  No worries.

There are two major systems for the naming of large numbers, the long scale and the short scale.  In the short scale, once you reach a million, the next named magnitude is a thousand times larger than the previous (a billion is a thousand million, a trillion is a thousand billion, and so forth).  In the long scale, once you reach a million, the next named* magnitude is a million times larger than the previous (a billion is a million million, a trillion is a million billion (short scale quintillion), and so forth).  There are some other systems as well (East Asia as a region seems to be fond of grouping numbers in fours).  The anglosphere has largely converted to the short scale, but...well, Wikipedia [has a map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EScalas_corta_y_larga.svg).

"The reason I thought of that analogy is because surely the ""reach"" of the event horizon will become less, not more, when there is another massive body nearby - because the gravity of the former will be reduced rather than increased when there's an opposing force nearby, no? I know normally mass would get stretched towards the nearby body, but in this case it's not mass we're talking about but a gravitational field.

Would it be more accurate to say that our guess has a 50% chance of being correct?  It seems like, at the point when the flipped coin is in the person's hand, there is a 0% chance for the face showing to be anything other than what it is.  So the chance of how the coin is oriented is irrelevant.  It's just the chance has shifted, so to speak, to our guess rather than the state of the coin.

From your frame of reference, relatively, there is a 50/50 probability. This takes into account how much data you have about the event. You don't know where it's going to land, so as far as you can tell, it's 50/50.

However, the true, ""absolute"", probability is 100%. This assumes you have all of the data necessary to determine the true probability. Which we usually don't.
