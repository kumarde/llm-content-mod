"> So what would have happened when Sanders hit a real opponent, someone who did not care about alienating the young college voters in his base? I have seen the opposition book assembled by Republicans for Sanders, and it was brutal. The Republicans would have torn him apart. And while Sanders supporters might delude themselves into believing that they could have defended him against all of this, there is a name for politicians who play defense all the time: losers.

> Here are a few tastes of what was in store for Sanders, straight out of the Republican playbook: He thinks rape is A-OK. In 1972, when he was 31, Sanders wrote a fictitious essay in which he described a woman enjoying being raped by three men. Yes, there is an explanation for it—a long, complicated one, just like the one that would make clear why the Clinton emails story was nonsense. And we all know how well that worked out.

> Then there’s the fact that Sanders was on unemployment until his mid-30s, and that he stole electricity from a neighbor after failing to pay his bills, and that he co-sponsored a bill to ship Vermont’s nuclear waste to a poor Hispanic community in Texas, where it could be dumped. You can just see the words “environmental racist” on Republican billboards. And if you can’t, I already did. They were in the Republican opposition research book as a proposal on how to frame the nuclear waste issue.

> Also on the list: Sanders violated campaign finance laws, criticized Clinton for supporting the 1994 crime bill that he voted for, and he voted against the Amber Alert system. His pitch for universal health care would have been used against him too, since it was tried in his home state of Vermont and collapsed due to excessive costs. Worst of all, the Republicans also had video of Sanders at a 1985 rally thrown by the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua where half a million people chanted, “Here, there, everywhere/the Yankee will die,’’ while President Daniel Ortega condemned “state terrorism” by America. Sanders said, on camera, supporting the Sandinistas was “patriotic.”

> The Republicans had at least four other damning Sanders videos (I don’t know what they showed), and the opposition research folder was almost 2-feet thick. (The section calling him a communist with connections to Castro alone would have cost him Florida.) In other words, the belief that Sanders would have walked into the White House based on polls taken before anyone really attacked him is a delusion built on a scaffolding of political ignorance.

> Could Sanders still have won? Well, Trump won, so anything is possible. But Sanders supporters puffing up their chests as they arrogantly declare Trump would have definitely lost against their candidate deserve to be ignored.

To a cultural Marxist, sure. Since you don't have the actual racist enemy anymore, you have to create the invisible enemy.


Like Christianity, in the view of leftist Marxist liberals, all whites are born with certain guilt and sin for their skin color. As a white person, you cannot feel any pride for your race or heritage, but yet must walk around with a certain sense of guilt that every other races issues were brought on by your ancestors. Complete and total **bullshit.**



All of black cultures issues, therefore to the Marxist, are the doing of white people and white culture.

They then cite a company no one has ever heard of with no link to their website or claim to allow a reader the ability to assess the validity of the claim.

But I thought it was surging?  I guess not for most of these sites.

Again - from what to what? Doubling from 1 to 2 isn't troubling.  

>But Daily Stormer seems to have seen the most dramatic spike in readership. In a recent post, Daily Stormer claimed that since the election the site “has had an added 30% traffic.”

Traffic doesn't mean unique users, there could be more people there circlejerking.  It doesn't really mean much.  Obviously it's being looked at by media outlets so hit pieces like this can be written. Ergo the traffic could be inflated, definitely not 30% inflated, so there is probably a legitimate surge.  Again, the source isn't cited, so you're taking the author at their word.

It's not fair to know the future then compare him against a candidate currently running. GW vs Trump in this argument would have to be pre 2000 GW vs Trump. In that context GW looks like a good guy who was the Governor of a very populous state and maybe a bit affable. He in every way is better than Trump is now as a person and a candidate. I would very much vote for that GW over Trump any day of the week to keep Trump out of the White House. Now with that being said if the choice was Trump another 4 years of GW or a minor 3rd party in Hillary I would still choose GW in a split second. Maybe even more so knowing he now has 8 years experience as president. But I most certainly wouldn't sit back and vote for someone with no chance of winning. I am and always will be pragmatic. This means I'm going to vote for the person most likely to hold up my values and ideals who has the largest chance of winning. ,politics,0

"&gt;The Homeland Security Department is already considering designating voting systems as critical infrastructure in the future, though it is unlikely to happen before the election, the second official said.

&gt;A presidential directive released in 2013 details 16 sectors that are considered critical infrastructure, including energy, financial services, healthcare, transportation, food and agriculture, and communications. The designation places responsibilities on the Homeland Security secretary to identify and prioritize those sectors, considering physical and cyber threats. The secretary is also required to conduct security checks and provide information about emerging and imminent threats.

Elections haven't been given the ""critical infrastructure"" designation so state authority has primacy over security matters, since elections are Constitutionally in their bailiwick.  There are even R state elections officials who are threatening lawsuits against *federal overreach* if DHS takes over the security responsibilities.  This is on the Republicans.  Again.",politics,0

"The LA Times poll is unique in that it polls the same group of people day after day. It's interesting and will be good to see how accurate it was when the election ends, but the pollsters already admit that there is some possible bias in it.

&gt;Some analysts think the Daybreak poll is slightly tilted toward the Republican side because of how it accounts for the way people voted in the last election. All pollsters weight their results somewhat to make sure their samples match known demographics; the right proportions of men and women, for example, or blacks, whites and Latinos. The Daybreak poll goes a step further and weights the sample to account for how people say they voted in 2012: It's set so that 25% of the sample are voters who say they cast a ballot for Mitt Romney and 27% for President Obama. The rest are either too young to have voted four years ago or say they didn't vote. The potential problem is that people tend to fib about how they voted. Polls have often found that the percentage of people who say after an election that they voted for the winner exceeds the winner's actual vote. If that's the case this year, then weighting for the vote history would result in slightly too many Republican voters in the sample, which would probably boost Trump's standing by a point or two. Unfortunately, there's no way to know for sure until we can compare the final vote to the poll's final forecast. Given how long it takes to count all the votes, that answer won't be available until at least a week after election day.

Looking at a larger set of polls shows that Clinton gained anywhere from 2-5% nationally, and performed very well in swing states.

And Hillary does??????????????????? Rofl

I'm sorry but the fact that you refuse to even say a single negative thing about her proves you're lying about your allegiance. A conservative would never, not in a million years allow liberal justices to be appointed and Hillary fucking Clinton to become president without anything bad to say about her.

You need to drop the act right now because its looking really pathetic.

"It seems like you didn't read what I said. I said ""complicit in murder"", and proceeded to say calling her a murderer is ""harsh, get it gets the job done"" and that ""I am biased against Hillary"", so calling her a murderer is nowhere short of the apocalyptic fucker you spewed in your initial statement. Trump is unlikely to do any of that. He's a populist, and the demographic that makes up his voters love that kind of excitable imagery. I'm not defending Trump, but his imaginary, future crimes don't match up against Hillary's real, past crimes. No, I'm not a Republican, I voted for Bernie, and the last 8 years have been no less violent than the 8 that proceeded it, short of 9-11. And no, I don't support the actions of the military in Iraq, though I don't specifically blame the troops. They are partially to blame, but so is our governmental establishment as it is.

"&gt; Then tell me the alternative to giving it a shot and trying to hold her accountable.

The only way to hold her accountable is by *not* voting for her!  Voting for her just enables her to lie and not do what she says and validates her belief that she can say whatever the fuck she wants and can get away with it.

Tell me, how do you hold her accountable once she's in office?...she's by definition unaccountable for at least 4 years.  She's going to be despised in 4 years anyway.  That's just who she is.  She's widely despised across the country, even by those who are voting for her.  She's going to likely be a 1 term president, and when the republicans don't run someone as caustic as Trump they will destroy her in 2020.  2020 also happens to be the next census and with Clinton still widely reviled (and I honestly can't see a realistic way she won't be) the republicans clean up house and gerrymander for another generation the house of representatives.

As opposed to taking our chances with Trump.  He'll set us back, no doubt.  He's a total monster with zero qualifications.  BUT...he'll be so disastrous that he will be the one destroyed in 2020, the republican party with him and then the democrats have a real shot at winning back state seats and winning back the house and setting the district lines.  The republican party will have to ""come to jesus"" so to speak and maybe / hopefully actually become a rational counter party and not the batshit insane party it has become recently.  The price we pay for no Trump now could be 10+ more years of republican obstructionism and gerrymandering in the 2020 elections when Clinton actually has to win against a regular republican.

Its an absolute nightmare of a choice, if you can even call it that.

I completely concede Trump is categorically worse than Clinton, absolutely.  There is no argument at all against that assertion.

I don't have a great answer for you.  For me, I am voting 3rd party myself.  I do not accept *at all* that a vote for 3rd party is any way voting for Trump.  Those who vote for Trump help Trump.  My non-vote for Clinton helps Trump just as much as my non-vote for Trump helps Clinton.  I will not vote for Clinton with a proverbial gun to my head.  I will not play that game.  I will vote for the person who best represents me. I will vote as if my ballot alone decides the contest.  

I perfectly understand that absolute horror Trump is.  But Clinton *on her own merits* its utterly unacceptable.  I cannot bring myself to vote for her and I haven't.  I've already voted and mailed in my 3rd party vote.  I'm not happy about it either.  I don't like anyone, but morally, I just cannot vote for the lesser of two evils. I genuinely believe Clinton is a detriment of democracy and I cannot vote for her despite how bad Trump is.
