i put up this piece of testimony for the sake of those once who need this oil to please don't die in silence their is a cure for your cancer today email: ricksimpsoncannabisoil96@gmail.com and get the oil.

"Everybody crying about the clipped ears needs to calm their tits. Pitbulls, Cane Corsos, Dobbies etc.. have had their ears clipped since the beginning and is a breed standard. All these dogs can go from looking a pussy ass dog to looking like a guard dog and having ""don't mess with me or my Family"" look just with the ears. 

I'm looking into picking up a Cane Corso pup and will only buy it with clipped ears, or drive it myself to have it done. These dogs look plain goofy with floppy ears. ",aww,1

"They have brachycephalic syndrome and can't breathe.  ""Cute pug noises"" are due to breathing difficulties, not cuteness.  The pug in this video has stenotic nares, which means its nostrils are pinched and the dog can barely breathe though his nose normally, if at all, and that's likely why it has its mouth open like that.
 
Pugs live a very physically stressful life.  There are probably a few breeders out there that breed less deformed pugs but they are hard to find.  I agree with your wife, I could not have a pug and worry every day if it's going to be able to breathe well enough, not overheat, not have spinal problems that would prevent it from getting to the next day.",aww,1

"A pitbull is like raised suspension pickup trucks. On their own, the dog is innocuous and harmless. But they're *often* (not always) owned by ill-tempered assholes as a status item, and so the dog often becomes an ill-tempered asshole too. This is a negative attribution that makes the dog itself look bad. But pitbulls are great dogs with great attitudes if well trained, just like a pickup truck is a great asset with great utility if owned by someone who isn't a fucking asshole.

The first time my dog saw an infant he was an instant babysitter.  The baby was on a blanket at a family gathering and he immediately layed on his belly and crawled super slow towards it.  He waited for the baby to touch him then he crawled a bit closer.  My dogs entire demeanor changed.  He would stay close to the baby and be constantly pacing around worrying.  It was cute and hilarious to see.   ,aww,0

"Nothing to do with the fur. It's a protein in their saliva called FEL-D1 to which people are often allergic to (like myself). Then, after licking their fur, when it sheds or when you touch the cats, you get the allergic reaction.

Siberian cats has less FEL D1 proteins than any other cats. Depending on the siberian, they can have more and less, depending on the parents, usually. But even the siberians having a ""higher"" level of protein compared to the breed have comsiderably lower amount of that protein than regular domestic cats. This also explains why furless ones can be considered hypoallergenic: if there's no fur to lick, there's not much to contaminate with fel-d1.

There is still a chance you aren't allergic to the protein like most but to the fur itself, or dust, etc etc. That is why you shouldN't blindly buy a siberian (especially since they're really expensive..) without visiting the shelter for a couple hours and putting all the siberians in your face all day to make sure. I visited a houss with 30 siberians and played with them for 3 hours without allergic reaction before deciding to buy one with my SO. I've seen other guys having the reaction (althought some were less intense that what they usually get), so it's never 100% guaranteed.

My brother in law came to see the kitten yersterday and didn't feel anything. Usually his eyes instantly becomes red and he can't breath. So that's good. Good luck!",aww,0

"It's entirely possible that the beginning of domestication was some wolves being more amenable to human proximity, following humans around, getting free food scraps. Over time their pups were more likely to have that ""tolerates humans"" trait and thus over time those early dogs sort of domesticated themselves before we eventually learned about things like training and selective breeding.

But regardless there is no question dogs are domesticated, by the literal definition of the word.",aww,0

"A lot of it has to do with how men and women just approach dogs differently.  Notice the guy who replied to you said that when he works with rescue dogs, he approaches them crouched down appearing smaller.

I've found in my working with abused dogs on and off that you can teach a man how to approach a dog non-threateningly and the dog will usually start reacting to that guy like he's not a guy.  Guys tend to just walk right up to dogs in a dominant manner, get inside the dog's personal space and force the interaction.

Women tend to move in more slowly and stop outside the dog's immediate personal space and then wait for the dog to engage.  If a man does this to a dog that normally ""hates"" men, he'll find the dog doesn't react to him like other men.",aww,0
