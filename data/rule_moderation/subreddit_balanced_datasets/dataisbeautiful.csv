"He is born blind and lives in a nursery chamber and his mother comes often to nurse him. When she isn’t there he is fed feces by non-reproductive females. He grows strong on shit and within a month is ready for work and solid food. He leaves the nursery chamber and navigates with the small hairs of his body and joins the tunnel workers.

Now come days of digging, and with his buck teeth and clawed feet he scrapes and kicks dirt to another tunnel worker who does the same and on and on in a chain of workers all the way to the tunnel entrance where the dirt is kicked up and out into the irrevocable beyond.

He loves his work. He loves digging new tunnels, extending his eusocial community’s own warrens, and he loves the feel of dirt on his buck teeth and feet. He loves too the finding of a tuber in the wall, for this is the food they live on, one good-sized tuber being enough to feed their entire underground community of 75 individuals for a few days. And he rips the tuber from the wall and carries it to the feeding chamber and this is the founding principal of their society, that all food must be shared.

But one day, in some spasm of selfishness, or disregard for his fellows, he finds a tuber in the wall and tells no one of it and he hides it and from time to time returns to it and takes a bite. He is discovered and shamed and demoted and now he lives in a small chamber with two other rulebreakers.

They are fed often and fattened and soon their time will come. They do not speak to each other, finding comfort in silence, not wishing to relive their own sins. And all three feel a sense of anomie, of alienation, and they wish for a way back, to feel again that sense of belonging, of having a purpose beyond this relentless feeding.

The rainy season arrives and his time has come and he leaves the small room and waddles to the main entrance. He can smell the rain and he can feel the wet dirt beneath his feet and he turns around and sticks his fat ass in that hole and seals it up and prevents the flooding of their tunnels.

If only that were the entirety of his role, if only that was all they required of his fat ass. For with the rainy season comes the predators, snakes and birds and more, who scratch and bite his ass and seek a way in. But he is a fat naked mole rat and he feels no pain and he holds his ass firm and refuses them entry and when they depart he is hailed as a hero.

"I will have a go at it then. Basically, it is completely true that women on average earn less than men. The exact figures are difficult to say, because everybody has there own number, but it definitely exists. Now, people argue that when you control for variables such as women working less hours or women caring for children or women not wanting to negotiate for pay raises or whatever then the wage gap goes away. That is true, although even after controlling for variables a small gap in earnings still exists. The thing is, by correcting for those variables you essentially say ""if you control for the causes of the problem there is no problem."" The wage gap shows there is a problem with women not getting as many hours, or being expected to stay home with the kids, or being seen as bitchy if they want a pay increase. People that claim it is proof of a secret cabal of white men intentionally paying women less are wrong, but people saying that the wage gap was made up by the spooky SJWs and that it disappears when you control for a shit ton of problems with the perceived roles of men and women and society are  ignoring the problems with the perceived roles of men and women in society.

Of course they are. Similarly countless people are unaware of the scale of the world's problems, not nobody. The fact is making sure everyone knows about the problem is much more important that making sure everyone has some vague motivation that different people tackled different problems in the past. 

>I said I get pissed off when people say how terrible the world is, and we need more positive perspective and less doom and gloom nonsense. That's not covering up anything, and it's ridiculous to suggest that.

A more positive perspective actively decreases the chances of solving problems. To go back to the example, telling people that we'll most likely beat global warming would fuck society, do you seriously not know this? 

>Unless it's actually not terrible, than it's just accurately depicting the problem

No, it's still minimising it. Even *if* all you're doing is presenting an accurate depiction of reality (you're not) even then you'd still be minimising the chances of problems being addressed. 

>Do you see no light between ""the world is terrible"" and ""the situation is good""?

"Perspective also plays a huge role in this. My wife (who is American) and I argue all the time about the definition of 'fat'. It is clearly different here; I can tell from talking to people and taking in the media here. Here, someone who I would say is (or rather, would be thought of in the UK as) definitely overweight is either average or chubby. Someone who is obese (medically and by UK standards) is large or big etc. The word 'obese' only gets thrown around when you get to the 100 pound+ overweight stage, which is a good indication of how much the American body type has changed in the last 50 years, and how much being overweight, and the definition of overweight, have changed and/or normalised. There are fat people everywhere in America, and that's just the sad reality.

Obviously, like you say it's not like every American is fat. The stats don't lie however: a shocking percentage are. Like I said though, this is an enormous problem in most western countries. America was just a few decades ahead. ",dataisbeautiful,1

I was so excited to see her and we planned on going to see a basketball game. As we were looking for tickets online, her computer started freezing up. She's new to Apple laptops and didn't know how to force quit any of the frozen apps. So I showed her how to do it. As I began closing her apps, her iMessage app appeared from the background and I saw her most recent texts, largely by accident, partially out of curiosity. She had been cheating on me. So I drove another six hours home that day. 2 weeks later, I'm still really sad.

It has everything to do with it. You weren't talking about Global Warming but resources. 

>There is a correlation between population growth and global warming. To deny this is to deny science.

Yes, the more people that exhale the more Co2 and that is a fact of life. It's also the more researchers, inventors of efficient fuels, its more people to push societies over the Co2 hump. 

That's science too. You sound like a Science Denier if you disagree. 

>Start with myself? Are you suggesting suicide? If so that is ridiculous.

No it isn't. You are producing Co2 by your very breath, typing these messages and then the lifestyle you need to sustain from coffee shops to roads to heating. Kill yourself and you've reduced the population just a little. Also any lineage you'd produce if you ever got a girlfriend and had sex.

>Use public transportation.

Because that's available and convenient everywhere?  Even if it was, do you know how inefficient it is to run an 85,000 lb subway car with 2 people on it during off times?  for comparison, a Honda Civic is about 3,000 lbs and probably closer to 2,500.  This is all forgetting if you need to carry something big or heavy or can't wait a fucking hour to get somewhere.

>Get a fuel efficient car, or an electric one.

Most cars are fuel efficient, and most people want that just to save money.  Electric cars are mostly coal powered at this point, so it doesn't do anything to help until we make the switch to nuclear or some other source with the capability of replacing coal.  Also, it takes a ton of energy to ship the materials around the world to make the batteries, so battery tech would need to come a long way for them to make a positive difference.

>Vote out climate change deniers.

Yeah, because fuck questioning an unsubstantiated hypothesis that claims we knew the exact aggregate temperature of the planet 50,000 years ago down to the degree.  People used to take Opium and Cocaine as medicine less than 100 years ago and we JUST figured out that bread and other carbs are actually bad for you, most scientists are fucking useless idiots just trying to stay employed by lying about evidence to support their claims.

"Here's the thing though: according to the church's teachings, being homosexual, i.e. having same-gender attraction etc. isn't inherently sinful. It's acting on that behavior that is sinful. So someone who steals can be forgiven if they repent and actively try to not do it again. Someone who is homosexual but doesn't act on those emotions ins't sinful and if they ""slip up"" I guess depending on the gravity can also be forgiven just the same if they repent and try to not do it again. In that sense, the person isn't a sin. 

And even if someone chooses to live out their homosexuality, there is still no reason to not treat them with anything but love and respect. It's no different than Jesus who associated with whores and others living sinful life. That doesn't mean that he condoned their lifestyle but we are constantly taught to become more like him, follow his example, develop charity which is ""the pure love of Christ"" etc. 

In my personal opinion I don't even agree with the whole sinfulness of homosexuality to start with and I actually believe that we might not have heard the last when it comes to that but that is just my very own personal opinion. I mean, we know by now that homosexuality isn't genetic, but that many people who are gay have felt that way, or have felt different from even a very young age. We believe that certain traits and parts of our personality, basically the essence of who we are, our spirit, has been with us even before birth and was created by god. To me it looks like homosexuality is part of that spiritual make-up of a person. Why would god make someone gay like that? We believe that love, attraction, sexuality and marriage are god-given gifts to us that aid us and also bring us joy and fulfillment in life, and that the highest degree of glory can only be inherited from god if we are married. Why would he make people in such a way that their inherent desires are contrary to his plan when for everyone else their desires are important and divine helps to bring his plan about? It just seems we're missing some major parts of the puzzle here, and until there is more clarity I refuse to buy into the whole homosexuality is a grievous sin thing. I mean even some animals show homosexual behavior so wtf. I might be totally wrong but that's just what I believe. Ultimately that belief fits more with who I have learned god to be and what his intentions for us are.

"Yeah I was a little spotty the first couple of weeks, because I wasn't familiar with the carb content of a lot of common foods, but once I had a couple of shopping trips where I loaded up on keto-friendly foods (frozen/freezable stuff is key), it became so easy.  Also I've found that getting plenty of fat in is another major 🔑 to staying full and satisfied. I have a ""bulletproof coffee"" (black coffee with butter, or ghee, and coconut oil) every morning for breakfast, and that holds me over until about 2 or 3pm. Then I make sure that whatever I eat for dinner, I get some form of fat in the mix. Chicken breast and steamed veggies for dinner? Why not start off with a salad with plenty of oil-based dressing?

We use our model to determine the probabilities of which candidates are likely to win on a state by state basis in order to compute the number of Electoral College votes (or number of Senate seats) that each party is likely to secure.

"It's worth noting that if no candidate gets 270 electoral college votes (tie) or a few states went to a candidate other than Clinton or Trump (and that candidate doesn't receive 270 votes), then by the [12th amendment](http://www.270towin.com/content/electoral-college-ties/) the House of Representatives votes state-wise for president from the top three candidates who received electoral college votes.  

Due to state-level gerrymandering after the 2010 census, [Republicans will almost certainly control the majority of House seats in most states](http://www.270towin.com/content/electoral-college-ties/) (betting markets put a [Republican controlled House at 98% odds](http://www.pivit.io/politics/2016-us-house-majority/5366)).  The Republican House members would then presumably vote for Trump, the Republican candidate (or face a huge backlash from their Republican constituency).

**TL;DR** If Hillary (or Johnson or Stein) doesn't get 270+ electoral college votes, then Trump will most likely become president.  Trump merely needs to prevent any single opponent from getting above 270.  (E.g., Clinton 269, Trump - 200, Stein - 69, results in a Trump presidency).",dataisbeautiful,0

"Based on the comments here, I think it's worth separating a few things:

* **Plots with linear segments between points**: Useful for interpolating somewhat sparse data, but confusing if the data is very noisy.  Potentially misleading if the data is very sparse or if the actual data points are not shown, just the lines (implying higher data density than there really is).  Generally not evil.
* **Plots with regressions**: Useful for interpreting noisy data, but potentially very misleading if the regression is too low-order to capture the underlying phenomena, if the data is too sparse, or any number of other things.  Some form of confidence measure should always be provided.  Not generally evil, but easily abused.
* **Plots with splines** (like your example): Basically always misleading.  Sharp transitions create bizarre shapes and (as in your example) can create false minima/maxima and/or imply that the trend is upward when it is downward or vice versa.  Smoothness of the curves suggests smoothness of the data, which may imply the data is far more dense and consistent than it really is.  Extremely poor behavior with noisy data.  Sometimes OK but generally evil.  When plotted without showing points for the real data, always evil.",dataisbeautiful,0

But you can see that education has a huge roll into the lives of those who are ""god fearing"" or not... something I've been aware of for a long time.  

The Northeast clearly does get it and I do agree that with all the scandals (especially those that have destroyed churches in the Northeast) - there has been a steady decline on people needing to go to church to give these organizations more money to help support what is clearly a corrupted system on many levels.

This isn't the ""put the priest on a pedestal"" society it once was (and how that movie portrayed things).  We instead speak out and sadly in some cases will SUE the religious groups themselves, something that was NEVER thought of a half century ago.  However sadly now, someone has to remove all the clutter from under the rugs that was put there all those decades ago and its not a pretty sight.

Proof in the pudding...  I cannot say I know a single person I went to school with that became a priest or nun.  As a result, the churches are losing their clergy as generations retire (or pass on) and thus no-one is there to replace them.  In some cases, entire parishes are nothing more than a transient priest from another church who comes in to help, because they have no-one living at the convent/rectory.  

Maybe its also the fact that history taught us that someone re-translated the bible only 400 years ago from something over 1500 years old... and that they CHOSE which stories went in and which didn't (that didn't follow the overall ideology of things?)

I think computer people tend not to have backgrounds in experimental sciences where you're taught about graphing, experimental error, etc.  While it's true that you're exactly measuring the value of a variable at a specific point of time, that's also true when you're taking precise values of temperature of a black box with a scope.  Just because the scope measured an exact temperature of 507.3 Kelvins, doesn't mean that that precisely represents the external state.  Similarly, just because the network bandwidth used is 73.2 Mb/s, that's using bucketing based on discrete time intervals, and there's a lot of chance based on where those time intervals lie.

In most cases the point of the graph is to understand short and long-term trends, so joining points together doesn't help with that.  Instead, it would be better to treat those measurements as samples of some external quantity.  Then you could attempt to fit curves to the data, which can help you understand what's happening better than simply joining adjacent points.",dataisbeautiful,0

"You want to know what is bad about left-wing policies?

You raise taxes and provide lots of social services. Then, as the population ages you are no longer able to afford those services. You even admit this problem.

What's the solution? Well, to import immigrants. Unfortunately, there are problems with this:

* This doesn't ""solve"" the problem, it just delays it. The immigrants will eventually also grow old, at which point you will need to import even more immigrants to replace them. This will never end. You keep delaying the inevitable. When you eventually hit the wall you will hit it so hard that your economy will collapse.

* Importing large numbers of immigrants displaces the native population, which destroys cultural identity and breeds conflict. This is the kind of thing that starts civil wars.

* Immigrants are often less productive than the natives. This varies depending on the country of origin. It is definitely the case for the MENA immigrants that Europe is now in love with.

* There are not an infinite number of immigrants in the world. This is self-evident. Eventually you will run out of people who want to move to your country (probably when collapse is imminent).

Additionally, the higher tax rates in these leftist countries encourages highly skilled workers to leave to find countries with lower taxes. Additionally, poorer individuals clamor to get into your country because they are generally unaffected by the high taxes.

The situation in Europe is the beginning of a downward spiral. The importation of millions of muslim refugees is just the beginning, but it won't be the end. Have fun.",dataisbeautiful,0

Its whats called a disconfirming hypothesis and its something that the Freakonomics people didnt do. Which is what i have issue with. Any theory can have holes or be predicated on some assumption. When something is proposed as infallibly correct i get suspicious.

The assumption that the Freakonomics team make is that the abortion rate affects the birth rate for at risk groups. In essence that a single abortion translates into a prevented birth for that year. Thats an assumption. Its not impossible to get pregnant the same year as having an abortion.
