"TBH, from reading your responses to other's comments it seems that you don't want to hear anything about people who don't mind/care about this being a thing. So far a few people said what they had to and gave their reasoning for their opinion. You, in turn, have tried to shut them down. It's fine if you don't like not having a National Dex, but don't try to shit on the opinions of others who are not in line with yours.  
  
Personally, I like the idea of having the National Dex tied to the bank. It means I don't have to transfer my entire Living Dex and allows me to still have access to those Pokemon on my Gen6 games. And if I need a specific 'mon for Gen7, eg. for egg moves, I'll just breed one specifically to transfer up to Gen7.

"I like to think that gen VIII's region will be based on Scotland, or some country in the UK (or even the whole of UK, depending).

So many golfers in gen VI (a sport that originates in Scotland), introduced invasive species (the Gumshoos line. I'm pretty sure mongooses are native to the UK, but the British are still hella responsible for introducing invasive species to a lot of places all over the world), and Gumshoos even look like they're wearing a generic hat you see on a lot of golfers *and* Scottish people, stereotypically (that's right, folks! It ain't a Trump hairpiece! It's a god damn flat cap).

Fun little tidbit of information I discovered while looking up things about mongooses in Hawaii:  
They were introduced to Hawaii (nowhere seems to state where from) in order to control the rat population, however, they ended up becoming an overpopulated species, and didn't do much in the way of controlling nocturnal rats.

In Sun and Moon, you can find Yungoos during the day, and Rattata at night in the same areas as each other. It's also said that Alolan variants of Pokemon are a mutation caused by the change in lifestyle or habitat. Because Rattata has been forced to only come out at night, it has become the Alolan dark-type variant that we see in-game, now. Thanks Yungoos!

Someone comes in telling people about a cool baton pass team your response oh that sucks what if the opponent has a team of unaware pokemon!! Lol in your head you your team always have that exact pokemon and moves to contour any strategy huh? Any other person would be like cool I can give a 3x special attack to one of my Pokemon, but your over here like ""No! That won't work if there are no stealth rock, and the opponent was holding a focus sash, or if he was holding a choice scarf and if you weren't or if the pokemon has the ability unaware, and if you didn't give your 3x to a powerful special Pokemon that isn't bulky or had any good move, and if your volbeat has twave then my Pokemon has Lum berry! thus this whole strategy sucks!

"**TL;DR:**  Type in ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ for proper formatting

Actual reply:

For the 

    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

like you were trying for you need three backslashes, so it should look like this when you type it out

    ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

which will turn out like this

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

The reason for this is that the underscore character (this one \_ ) is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does (this guy \* ).  Since the ""face"" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the ""face"" (this guy (ツ) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first ""\\_"" is just saying ""hey, I don't want to italicize (ツ)"" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol

***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***

Edit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \_italicize\_ or \*italicize\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\_italicize\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\\\_/¯ but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.",pokemon,1

"https://citra-emu.org/page/download

Download Bleeding Edge Version 42 and dont update it, newer versions do not work with pokemon.

If your emulation is slow turn off V-Sync under graphic options, but be aware that this will make citra run in super high speed in less frame demanding situation such as openning your bag.Also you need decent hardware for it, if you crash while booting game or run super slow, that may be it.

Citra cannot run the game online and may run slowly in random places, so , if you can buy/have a 3DS and the game, its a better alternative.Im only using Citra because a 3DS is ultra expensive where i live.",pokemon,1

-it's fire/dark

-it isn't fat, 

-it's not a pig

-he actually his the only fire starter that fight and behave like a total douchebag. 

The only real thing they have in common is that they stands on two legs (i'm not sure about Emboar being a wrestler...unlike Pignite).

Don't get me wrong i understand you don't like it, but the argument of ""it already exist"" is poor especially in a game with more than 700 pokemon.",pokemon,1

All I can suggest is therapy, because you're clearly stressed. Even if you're losing a lot, you shouldn't get so angry at a game that you would want to destroy your computer.

Smogon rules are really only relevant on pokemon showdown. You gotta know when to shut that mindset off. 

I remember I was challenge to a friendly battle with some person I met on a chat room once and we never talked about smogon or any other rules. It straight up was like ""hey you wanna battle?"" And I was like ""sure"". Few minutes later they are butthurt I beat them using my greninja and mega lucario and they complained I used ""ubers"" and they couldn't respect a winner who uses ubers or some junk.

"If you cancel the evolution you will learn outrage earlier which in my opinion is a personal preference of how much you plan on using that move. However you ARE sacrificing the fact that he learns wing attack at 55. You would have to use a heart scale at a move tutor to relearn that move later on, and it's up to you to decide weather a 7 level sooner outrage is worth your heart scale time if you wanted wing attack on your move pool.

The sub's music is LOUD. IN YOUR FACE. INTENSE. And it stays that way throughout the whole fight. Meanwhile, the dub's music is more subtle, putting us in Ash's position at first, letting us know this is a losing battle, especially given how powerful Diantha and her Gardevoir are. But when Ash-Greninja shows up, the music shifts to reflect Diantha's POV, where she's starting to see that Ash and Greninja may very well have a shred of competence after all.

"That's silly, there are obvious design trends within pokemon. While not universal, there are traits I like identify as ""Pokemon-y"" and others I don't. 

Personally, there is't much in Rowlet's I dislike from a ""Pokemon-y"" standpoint. Litten's on the other hand is far too animated in a far too human way- its an outstanding character with loads of awesome Disney-esque qualities, giant fingers included, but it crosses the line between animal and anthro that I prefer not to cross with Pokemon, one they actually *dont* cross all that often.

Dialga and Palkia, to me, don't look like what I'm looking for in Pokemon at all. Theyre hugely overdesigned, at once too stiff (seriously Palkia can't move without it looking super awkward) and yet too vague. The excess of design elements (random spikes, armor of all different styles, stripes, tusks, horns, etc etc all over the place) and strange proportions all make them look less and less like the clean ""pokemon-y"" design I like and experience with the pokemon designs I prefer and consider most personally iconic

EDIT:

Or if you will another analogy,

Emperors New Groove doesnt really look like a Disney movie. Its a fun movie, made by Disney, but its so stylistically distinct (even with other distinctive films like Hercules, Aladdin, even Lion King share more ""DNA"" in their artstyles than the silly llama flick) Yet a non-Disney film Anastasia (or Secret of NIMH or Fern Gully) are much more evocative of that classic Disney style.

So while it might be difficult to exactly express what that Disney style was (Even in the same movie- Snow White is stylistcally VERY distinct from any of the Dwarves) it isn't hard to recognize when a film fails to meet that style, even if it is literally a Disney movie",pokemon,0

"I've gotten into Pokemon again recently and I'd also suggest starting with Firered/greenleaf, they have the same story as gen 1 games but they're much better. Head to HG/SS then and if you want to play through the series and reach gen vi then jump to gen iv (Platinum) then black/ white and bw 2 and then gen vi with xy and as/or. If you want to take your time and play gen 3 then play Emerald only. The reason is simple, Alpha Sapphire/OR have the same plot as R and S, so playing the same storyline 3 times can get a bit boring. So:

FR/LG -&gt; HG/SS -&gt; (optional) Emerald -&gt; Platinum -&gt; B/W -&gt; B/W 2 -&gt; X/Y --&gt; OR/AS

"&gt; i don't understand why people dislike it so much, we have a ton of quadrupedal beasts already. and not just in pokemon, but in pop culture in general. luchalitten is a breath of fresh air in that regard and oozes personality, i'll take him over a generic ""cool"" tiger any day.

Yeah except we haven't really had a legitimate Tiger pokemon, it would've been nice to have one. Also not sure why you're assuming that a quadrapedal tiger design would have to be 'generic' or lack personality.  I also fail to see how he's a 'breath of fresh air', most people are thinking that it's the exact opposite...

&gt;and i already know what everyone's gonna say: ""ohh but we've had so many bipedal fighting starters already"" well, luchalitten has a new silhouette. luchalitten has a new color scheme.

Completely arbitrary changes. No shit it's gonna have a slightly different design than the last few. Emboar had all of those things, that didn't stop it from being a godawful starter. As a concept it's still the exact same thing we had for 3 generations. 

&gt;i don't know about you, but i trust professional designers more than random people who probably don't know the first thing about cohesive design.

WTF kind of logic is that? You're basically saying that the Pokemon designers are gods and that everything they create is perfect, which is absurd. There have been plenty of terrible Pokemon designs in the past and according to many people Luchalitten is one of them.

&gt;in the end, if you don't like it, pick something else, but don't claim to be an expert.

I'm not even sure where this comment is coming from. Who claimed to be an expert? What would being an expert even mean? People are disliking the design because it looks ugly and because the motif is way too similar to the last 3 fire starters.

&gt;you're don't have to like it, but don't pretend like thought wasn't put into that design.

Again, you keep bringing up these ridiculous strawman arguments for no reason. No one is saying thought wasn't put into the design. Every design has thought put into it, but that doesn't automatically make the design good.

Seems like you're just lashing out at people that have a different opinion than you and I'm not really sure why. No one is forcing you to hate it. People have a right to dislike the design, just as much as you have the right to like it. ",pokemon,0

"Mine was very similar, I had Emboar, Levanny, Unfezant, Beartic, Stoutland, and Boldore. I wouldn't say it was my favorite though.",pokemon,0
"Yeah. The Japanese pronunciation is ""ar-say-us"" (aruseusu), and that's the closest. But then there's ""Archeus"", which the name kind of derives from. So I think that's why the guys over at the TPC use them interchangeably. ",pokemon,0

"They are strong. Strong enough to lay waste to a country through collateral damage, apparently. Reshiram's dex entry mentions how the heat from its tail reactor is capable of affecting the world's weather.

So what they do is beat up anyone who disagrees with their owner's truth/ideals.",pokemon,0

That too. Kind of a mix of the two.,pokemon,0
"Dont get me wrong, these are amazing, but i feel like it should look like the first form x ponyta i.e. I think it should be mareep x ponyta or deerling x ponyta, not sawsbuck orampharous, but otherwise theyre awesome",pokemon,0

It seems the only ability that would be worse is one that is clearly designed to ""nerf"" the Pokemon, like Truant or Slow Start.",pokemon,0
"You've got the 10% form,  50% form,  75% forms,  etc. I don't think it's been stated there were 100 specifically but since it's all based on percentages that's the most sensible option. 

Though I suppose each cell could also be worth 10% I guess. That'd be much lamer though imo.

"If these are real, Popplio will defenitely be my pick. I'm loving it a lot.

Litten's evo is not what I wanted but I hope at least the middle evo will be better.

Honestly, I never even considered picking Rowlet. Not that I hate it or anything. It was just overshadowed by Popplio, who I kinda felt bad for, and Litten who is, well a cat. I know it was the most popular of the 3 when they were first announced, but IMO it just looks decent at best. As an owl, better than Noctowl, as a starter, I've seen better.",pokemon,0
It's not tasteless. It reminds me of kiwi. With that sort of tart taste. Though I have no idea if you'd be able to get it. But it's so cool looking. Looks like a dragon egg. ,pokemon,0
"I NEEDED TO LEVEL UP MY MAROWAK TO LEARN A FEW MOVES SO I DECIDED TO BATTLE THE TRAINERS AT THE BATTLE RESORT.

*SCREW BUG MANIAC FELIX IN PARTICULAR!*

HIS SCIZOR USED A SWORDS DANCE AND SWEPT MOST OF MY TEAM WITH DOUBLE HIT (IT WAS PROBABLY TECHNICIAN BOOSTED TOO). IT WAS REALLY FUN SEEING MY POKEMON SURVIVE THE FIRST HIT, ONLY TO BE TAKEN DOWN BY THE SECOND ONE. /S 

MY MAGMORTAR'S FIRE BLAST MISSED IT TOO AND HIS SCIZOR KNOCKED IT OUT **WITH A CRIT!** HIS SCIZOR ALSO CRIT ANOTHER ONE OF MY POKEMON TOO.

AND IT DOESN'T STOP THERE. AFTER I FINALLY KNOCKED OUT HIS SCIZOR, HE SENDS OUT HIS PINSIR. FIRST TURN USING IT, IT USES GUILLOTINE AND **IT ACTUALLY LANDS!** THE POKEMON I SENT OUT WAS AT FULL HEALTH TOO! THEN THE PINSIR SWEPT THE REST OF MY TEAM!

SINCE THE GUY TOOK THOUSANDS WORTH OF CURRENCY FROM ME, I RESTARTED THE GAME AND CHALLENGED HIM AGAIN (I NEED THAT MONEY FOR THE DAYCARE AND OTHER THINGS).

GUESS WHAT HAPPENED? HIS PINSIR SUCCESSFULLY HIT MY POKEMON WITH GULLIOTINE **TWO TIMES IN A FUCKING ROW!** I MANAGED TO BEAT HIM THAT TIME BUT I STILL HAVE LEFTOVER SALT.

30% CHANCE OF LANDING MY ASS! YOU'RE TELLING ME HE LANDED *THREE* 30% ACCURACY ATTACKS AND I KEPT MISSING HIM WITH A 75% ACCURATE FIRE BLAST?! 

WHAT IS THIS WITCHCRAFT? IS HE SECRETLY ALAIN IN DISGUISE? IS HE A TRAINER FROM THE BATTLE MAISON? (WOULD MAKE SENSE CONSIDERING HE'S CLOSE TO THE FRONT DOOR.) RNG HATES ME TODAY!",pokemon,0
