"Yes, but if there is a body/proof of any kind that it wasn't just an unfortunate, drunken mistake, there would also be a chance of implicating OP, albeit a small one.

You don't need ""loved ones"" to push for more answers when you have a smart or experienced ME to have suspicion. Cut that part out of the equation and you're much better off.

Also as someone who's been in a marriage similar to this, though the non-consensual sleep sex only happened a handful of times (and I wouldn't dream of doing anything like OP, ever) the alcohol-induced anger was fairly constant, and I understand very, very, much how soul-crushing this kind of relationship can be.

"if the town is isolated enough, then maybe this might work - 

you remember how HG Wells did a radio broadcast of *War of the Worlds* and people were legit packing their shit and getting the fuck out of Dodge and going crazy? well, plant a story that says something along the lines of: ""due to this town's isolated nature and their almost nonexistent connection to the outside world, the people went crazy and turned on each other when they saw/heard/read (whatever you come up with). make sure to actually produce whatever it is you're saying these people responded to, and that it's it's legit and detailed, so that a town believing it would be an actual possibility. say that the programming was so realistic that people started rioting and turning on each other - believing their town to be the only one left on earth, and it de-escalated to the point of murder and cannibalism. this would explain the deaths, the damage to the town, the behavior, everything that would result from your uncle's experiment. 

of course, you sugarcoat this story with another one about how a pharmaceutical company was illegally dumping their failed schizophrenia meds into the towns water supply to save on waste costs associated with disposing medicines. why were the schizophrenic meds failed? because in their clinical trial, 9 cases out of 10 actually produced exacerbated symptoms in patients, and actually *created* the mental condition in the control group (the ones who didn't have schizophrenia). the study of course would be quadruple blind, with two groups of patients, those who were diagnosed and those who weren't, and those two groups split with placebo and the ""failed"" medication. this part would explain how the situation came to be, and add a layer of plausibility and credibility to the scenario I outlined.

""why would a town believe this radio broadcast** and flip their shit?""

""well, they were all turned schizophrenic by this company who was dumping their failed meds into their water supply.""

""oh, that makes sense. they lost their shit and couldn't tell fact from fiction.""

""exactly.""

**radio broadcast, or whatever type of programming you decide to go with. 

boom. I would fucking buy that shit, the world is so fucked up today that this seems plausible. you seem to have enough power to make all of this legitimized.

It's especially good and unexpected when the thing in question which is being looked away from for a moment is a bunch of murderers outside a child's bedroom window who have only been there for three seconds. Top notch.
I also particularly liked the part where your wife confirms that it's a real, and there are in fact people outside your house each night with intent on killing you and you family, and a you wrote about that realisation was that you said ""what the fuck"". I can tell you're a writer, very mysterious and thought provoking.

"I was born with Asperger's syndrome. I have less empathy than most (although not psycopathic). I have at times said hurtful things to people without much thought for their feelings, although with age I am better at avoiding this or apolagising if I realise I have. Do you think that people who know me should respond by returning the same disregard for my feelings even. Even if you do, which is pretty vengeful, that is not how they respond. Actions that break the law are bad. Someones base attributes (such as a lack of empathy) are neither good nor bad. Its up to the person to make the right choices whilst being aware of any tendencies they might have (like me unintentionally offending someone). Certain jobs actually are better suited to psycopaths since they dont care if denying someones insurance is morrally grey. Anyone can commit murder given the correct situation, its just easier for a psycopath since they have less moral inhibitions.

TLDR: Noone chooses to be a psycopath. Condemn actions, not genetics.

P.S I am not trying to compare Asperger's with psycopathic traits. Just trying to give an example that is maybe easir to understand of people caring for someone even if its not reciprocated.",nosleep,1

Night 2

I wake up. Eyes wide, I hear the floors creaking I the hallway. I stare at the door hoping that whoever causes this strange black dust to appear doesn't come for me too. I look over at the notes i took from the court today. Thankfully, they are still there. As the creaks of the floor draw nearer, I wait with held breath. Then I see it. 

It's my grandma.

""Oh he will be so scared by this."" She said. She walks to my desk and looks at the notes. She giggles and climbs on the desk. I stare with wide eyes at what is happening. Then all of a sudden she squats and farts dust all over my notes. Then she jumps out the window and runs down the street, back to where ever she came from.

"Hey! Mad props on your story here bro. It almost works. The whole approach, support, and audience participation is exactly what's needed to keep a story like this on point and going, but if I may offer advice for your next attempt: play the ignorant card a bit better. As in, instead of saying you don't know, present some info that the audience would know more about but act like you think it means something else entirely. If it weren't for the ignorant aspect of the character you're presenting, then it would be completely sellable and make this whole story more than just a nosleep sub semi-ARG-style creepypasta. It would evolve it to where it looks like you're trying to go with it, possibly breaking the bounds of the web participation and going full ARG. That's where all creepy pasta is trying to go with itself anyways, right. And that's where all the best have gone..  

If you're interested in how other approaches to ARGs were used to work for other artists outside of this genre, look to NIN's Year Zero and everything leading up to its release. There's some great pointers in that process that any aspiring content creator should reflect on. 

Best o luck on your next story. I do hope it is at least as good as this one if not better. And I'm curious to see how you end this one. Does the OP disappear?  Or does he return to his audience, a changed man, one who sees the errors of his ways leaving the seeds of doubt in the audience and that door open to continue this story but from the voice of other victims and passerbys. The art of these types of engagements aren't nearly as much about the setup as they are about the ability to evolve with the display. Where you take this will define you as the artist behind the scenes.

"You are obviously not a social worker. Don't make up things just to try and prove a point.

I agree that CPS helps kids, but the system is so broken and neglected, that a lot of the times, they do not help, and sometimes it make things a lot worse.

I was abused as a child as well, and while I did not choose the path of drug addiction, I have my own demons that I have to battle. If you were abused, then you would understand that not everyone is fortunate enough to have the education or strength or opportunity to stay on a safe path. To say that you ""hate people that don't take responsibility"" shows your ignorance in the subject. It's never that easy.

Also, a nine year old calling their father their ""boyfriend"" is not a cause for alarm. As people have already pointed out, if you have any experience with children at all, you would know that young kids do not know the difference between the kinds of relationships adults and children have. I tried to french kiss my dad once because I saw it on TV and figured that's how people who love each other kiss.

Maybe I just know all the outliers, or maybe every person child services has helped just keeps it to themselves.

Also...I, as another product of trauma and abuse (albeit in different ways), have a lot of experience with psychiatrists/therapists. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure they fall into the ""social worker"" category? I've seen good ones and I've seen shitty ones, but none of them have ever said to me (or my friend, for that matter) that my trauma is my fault, and my rather unhealthy coping mechanisms are something I wouldn't have to deal with ""if only I'd made a different choice."" Because they understand an unhealthy mind makes unhealthy choices, and that sometimes people feel that they HAVE no choice.

"My grandfather, now RIP, would sit in a chair with his hand outstretched as if he was holding someone's hand.  A short term friend stopped by, looked, then murmured to quickly walk away. She then proceeded to describe my grandmother, a woman who was sitting next to my grandfather holding his hand but was very irritated when she saw my friend staring at her. My friend refused to come by my grandfathers again. Said my grandmother didn't like her.

"OP, I am so sorry to see this, and I know your pain. I, too, had horrible dreams for years of losing my children in my dreams. I don't have any, and I won't, I can't. I know from experience those nightmares can have an awful affect on your health, they're horrendously upsetting. The only consolation I feel I can offer is that whilst we may not be able to create our own little ones, we can take the unwanted and unloved children others have made. You can adopt, you can foster, if you felt up to it of course, I don't presume to know you but these little facts comfort me personally. It's tough, but you will survive this, the hurt will lessen and you will be ok. I wish you happiness, I really do. Go Mbeidh Na Dia Leat, Mo Chara.",nosleep,0

"Wow, reading this had me at the edge of my seat for the entire time.

But can you (or anyone else) clarify the ending for me? Like why did your brother point to the picture you drew and say ""He looked just like her fucking drawings!”? Am I right to think that he was an imaginary friend, and your family was just humoring you this entire time until your brother actually saw him, but without eyes?",nosleep,0

"No. The kid killed his whole family, he wanted to be the center of attention but on all his birthdays other people were in the spotlight, whether it was the father, brother or his mother, but not this sick little twisted child. He killed his father, he killed his brother and then he killed his mother. ",nosleep,0

"Your dad sounds like he was one hellava guy!!! Truly someone I would have loved meeting and knowing... Made me think of my own daddy. Gone also. He wasn't a hunter. He felt pain when my sister or I cried. He once spent hours massaging and helping our old dog Popi's legs... He sat with us as Dr. Warner( awesome vet) put our Popi to sleep in the living room. He then buried her for us. Nope, my dad wasn't a hunter, or a beer drinker either... He WAS search and rescue in Vietnam... All great stories should hit home. Your dad's story surely did for me... Thank you! And thanks to your dad, for showing you how to be a good ""daddy""....",nosleep,0
