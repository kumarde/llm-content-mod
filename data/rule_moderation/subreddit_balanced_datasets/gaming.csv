"I bought the Hitman pack off a Steam Sale once, and this was the one I enjoyed the most. Everyone always says Blood Money is the best, but I had trouble with the first mission. It just felt like it didn't age very well and the controls were wonky. Absolution looked pretty, and played well. I like a decent Stealth game, particularly when you can use it as a playground. I never ended up playing through the whole story (though that's not rare for me with video games), but I still occasionally revisit certain levels just to have fun. There's a lot of different ways you can kill people, and sometimes its fun to eschew the rules and make your challenges. There's even a multiplayer option for that, where they let you create challenges within levels, and you can play them. According to Steam, I've spent 23 hours (that's a lot for me, I'm a filthy casual), after spending maybe 10 bucks on the whole Hitman series. Well worth it, in my opinion. Definitely recommend it.",gaming,1

Consequently those games still have servers due to people spending enough time to be invested in communities or just not wanting to relearn (plus hardware stuff too). Same can be said for battlefield games and even early quake or unreal. 

BO1 still has active communities on pc with its dedicated servers but it's only a few servers. I guarantee that if the community wasn't split by new games AND dlc than the games would still be thriving but that isn't lucrative. 

At this point I'd pay for BO2 to get dedicated servers only thru the publisher at a high price as so many people loved that game. To me it was fps perfection, well... that and css before orange box update. ",gaming,1

unless i camp somewhere with a sniper, and who the fuck wants to be *that* guy?

so if you can use a gamepad playing quake3 deathmatch, where you're always moving, always, always looking around, every single second, and you can do that as efficiently as you could with a mouse and keyboard...

then holy shit.",gaming,1

"A sensible approach to the modern game market:

Rule 1: Don't pre-order shit. 
Rule 2: Don't buy into hype.
Rule 3: Don't trust developers promises. 

When a game comes out? 

Step 1: Wait for the community to get a feel for it. Read reviews, comments on reddit, youtube, game forums, etc. 
Step 2: Watch raw game play footage. Edited game play may be fun to watch, but you're not getting the full story. 
Step 3a: Still on the edge? Torrent the game,if you can, play for 60 minutes. Don't like it? Delete the files. Remember, piracy is bad, consider this a demo, like they did on older games. 
Step 3b: Buy the game. If you torrented the game to test, delete the files.

"Very true, Something tells me that this will be limited edition though, and there's a 50/50 chance that more of these will not ever be made. I actually emailed Nintendo about this a couple if days ago, and even their own staff don't know for sure. So it could totally go either way. Either they are manufacturing demand through scarcity in order to make people want it badly before proper supply comes in (at which point they would really clean up and make a tonne of money), or they are deliberately not going to make any more units so that they get everybody frantically checking their website on a daily basis for when the Nintendo Switch comes out in March. (loads of desperate people who missed out on the NES Classic and don't want that ever to happen to them again, will flock to buy a Nintendo Switch having now been conditioned by the ""get it now before you no longer can"" feeling. If it turns out to be that, it's despicable, but kind of genius at the same time from a marketing point of view.  I also totally get why they might be cautious in case people just forget about the NES Classic once the Switch is released, but I honestly don't think that will be an issue, as while I know lots of people fearing the NES Classic will never come out again are falling prey to the scalpers charging extortionate prices for these things just in case that's the last to ever be produced, I know so many people who refuse to do that and are still desperately holding out for the NES Classic to be sold by Nintendo at their proper RRP, and will buy one the moment it hits stores (aswell as the Switch when it comes out, not instead). So it's a license to print money if Nintendo plays this right and doesn't miss out on that huge opportunity.",gaming,1

"But this is a new type of DLC. Instead of making new content for the game, they rip parts out of the original and sell it for more money.

4. 3rd or 4th fucking time you cannot name me ONE horseshit game you enjoy you stalling dodging the question mother fucker. Oh don't like cupcake do you? How about puddin? Snookums? Zilch? That last one really fits you. Oh and nice try saying that the level of intelligence of a person can be judged on if they say the word cupcake or not. Holy shit are you a reaching asshole.

5. How is it not a fact. I am giving free reign to tell me why it is not the same basic principal that is done every year thereby making it so lacking in originality as to be obvious and boring. I guaran-fucking-tee you WILL NOT ANSWER. You'll just dance around the fucking question like a group of Native Americans with a drum beat. 

Here's your problem sweetie, you haven't made any points yet. All you do is disagree with what I say simply because I said it but have no substance to it. It's like I say this is good for this reason you just say ""No"" but don't say why. And when I ask for a why you just say ""Dude different opinion! Gosh!"" 
I mean look at the insults you choose. 1. You are a dumb. 2. Eat shit. 3. big boy. 
Yet you have the AUDACITY to tell me not to say cupcake because it's a lower intelligent thing. lol you can't make up losers like you. 

But you know what, no matter what happens I've already won because your comment is in oblivion where it belongs. Know what that means? NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOUR SHITTY PHONY OPINION.

"you fucking moron idiot, you started angry before anyone else, scroll up. 

you are wrong. 

daud did not train himself, daud was taught how to be stealthy and then honed his skills, the only thing daud taught himself was how to control his magic. 

corvo was not chosen because of his situation, he was chosen because of daud, the outsider felt that there was no one strong enough to challenge him and started to grow bored therefore waited until someone with potential was wronged by him. 

yes daud did indeed train some of the whalers but almost all of them were already skilled assassins before hand and billie lurk handled the majority of training as his second in command. 

and sokolov did almost everything interesting in the dishonored universe, he painted the portrait of delilah long before she was a witch, he created almost all of the nations technology and defenses, he stood in parliament for many decisions including those that created war, he hales from tyvia and despises his own people and is one of the very few men to travel to pandyssia and leave alive.

"They're complaining about SINGLE players on a team being SOMEWHAT higher/lower ranked, or in the case of predefined groups, perhaps way higher/lower. Predefined groups now have conditions for forming, though, and such discrepencies are no longer permitted. Those comments were all from season one, as well. They are out of date and no longer apply. Season two has been tightened up and refined very much in terms of match making and ranking.

In Battleborn I have seen screenshots of five level 100 players getting matched against 5 players under level 10. Nothing like that has *ever* happened in Overwatch.

The ""hostility"" of my post above was merely my opinion of the game. Just to make it clear, it has flaws and many of them, but no rational person would count its match making among them.

"Look up these games by Quantic Dream: 

1. Farenheit (also known as Indigo Prophecy)

2. Heavy Rain

3. Beyond: Two Souls

4. Detroit: Become Human (upcoming release. The latest E3 trailer actually SHOWCASES the decision making stuff; I think this was the first game trailer ever to actually do that)


You can consider these Telltale Games as well, but the main difference between these and Quantic Dream games is that Telltale Games have illusory choices, meaning in the very end, there are really few variations since all the choices merge together anyway. Compare to Heavy Rain, for instance, where the main characters can die, but the story still continues, resulting in wildly different endings.

1. The Wolf Among Us

2. Tales from the Borderlands

3. Game of Thrones 

4. Batman

5. Minecraft: Story Mode


And finally, there are only 2 other games from other developers with similar type of gameplay that I can think of: 

1. Until Dawn

2. Life is Strange


And a little note: Quantic Dreams is the granddaddy of these type of games. I am incredibly excited for Detroit. It looks truly amazing.

"Yeah, I stand by the fact you should let Kenny live. Kenny was a dick, but he would never do anything to hurt Clem. IIRC, there's a part where Clem can cut off the arm of Kenny's new wife or something (which I think kills her), and while if it was anyone else, Kenny would've definitely gotten violent with them, with Clem, he just gets pissed and yells. Which is a very reasonable response considering what he's been through, he watched his son get bit and start to die, he possibly had to shoot his son himself, and then he watched his wife kill herself. Then he finally found someone else, and she gets bitten by a zombie. The guy's been through a lot.

And, if you let him live and you travel with him to that safe haven place, they tell him they're full and he wants you and AJ to go in alone, knowing full well that that'll leave him alone in the middle of winter up north to likely die. This just super proves that he puts the safety of Clem (and AJ) before himself.

On the other hand, you know Jane would 10 times out of 10 pick her own safety over Clem's and especially over the baby's. She's also as much of a dick as Kenny is, leaving the baby alone in a car just to provoke him. Like no shit hiding one of the few things keeping an emotionally unstable guy from becoming completely destroyed will get him pissed. You don't need to actually do it to prove it to a 10 year old that knows him way better than you do. And the fight wasn't exactly short, she could have stopped it at any time by telling him that the baby was safe. She didn't just to prove a point.

The only option other than going with Kenny that makes sense (because there's no way I'm trusting Jane with anything anymore), is going alone, but that's just strategically a bad idea.",gaming,0

Personally something i really liked about Hard West was its introduction of a visible luck stat which massively reduces RNG. The idea is it's basically impossible to get hit while in cover with full luck but getting missed reduces luck (higher hit %whereas getting hit increases luck again, normalising damage. Besides more damage gets cut while in cover and cover isn't destructible so the gameplay is overall relatively predictable. On the other hand it's not like in most (time pressure lacking) xcom missions where you only have to deal with one enemy spawn at a time, which is very abusable by being cautious extending your team's LoS. Unseen enemies may be trying to flank you from all sides.

The legal issues have since been resolved and the rights were sold to a major studio back in April, when it was announced that there would be an announcement from the major studio ""shortly"".

A popular bet is that HBO have bought the rights to follow up after Game of Thrones winds down (apparently there are only plans for 13 more Game of Thrones episodes).

Even if you want to argue that it's not glitchy (I could refute with 10s of posts talking about the problems with the game still to this day, even simple shooting in hOnline is still laggy and glitchy to this day, the game is just a good demo, it's good for a beta but is no substitute for a halo title in anyway.

Secondly, Have you tried halo 5 forge? It's next level ridiculous. It was completely rebuilt, you don't just get to place objects like in halo 3/reach/halo4 the complexity and the things you are able to do in halo 5 is like one step below gui coding. You can even script A.I https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_DiGQfmcMY

Thirdly, halo 5 forge will have the universal file/map browser linked between the console and pc version, the library is already huge, like halo 3 on consle.

Basically halo online is a really small project with low funding and the game is incomplete and stands as a demo in beta phase, halo 5 is a complete halo title game with millions of dollars and hundreds of people that went into it's development.

Long answer: What you buy truely depends on what you're seeking as a gamer. PC is the best for deep, inmersive and graphical eye candy experiences.

If you want to play casual or fast paced games, play PS4 Pro. Do note that PC doesn't charge you for online multiplayer, and you should have games on hand for either-or if you don't have any.
