1⁄4 cup sour cream

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease one 8x12 inch baking dish.
Rinse fish fillets under cold water, and pat dry with paper towels. Lay fillets side by side in the prepared baking dish. Pour the salsa over the top, and sprinkle evenly with the shredded cheese. Top with the crushed corn chips.
Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until fish is opaque and flakes with a fork. Serve topped with sliced avocado and sour cream.

> 2. You can either fry the eggs in a separate pan and put them on the mixture or poke holes in the mixture and dump the raw eggs in. I fried the eggs separately but it's all going in a tortilla that's going in your stomach at the end of the day.

"It's thinly sliced ribeye. I can find it at trader joes up in Boston, but I know that isn't gonna be universal. 

You pretty much want to chop it up while you are cooking it - you will see cooks hitting it with the sides of their spatulas while on the griddle. It prevents it from being ""stringy"" when you eat it, and helps the cheese saturate more. This is when you want to be adding salt and pepper. Because of this, it is good to be cooking this in a cast iron (if you don't have a griddle)

Toppings are basically just onions and cheese. I like mine with mushrooms, but that isn't traditional. 

When the meat is just about done cooking (go with medium high and go down from there as needed. There should be just a little bit of browning,) put a shitload of cheese on it. Like, you probably would think 3 slices is ""enough"" but it isn't. Do like, 5 or 6 slices, minimum, and let it really soak into the meat. Also, I swear I never went to a place that fucked around with provolone, maybe I just ignored it.  Cooper cheese is my favorite to use (it is what you get when you go to a real deli and ask for american.)  

The roll is what makes the sandwich. People don't understand that. You can't just get like a grinder roll or a baguette and call it a philly cheesesteak. One thing you will notice in Philadelphia is that they are fucking SERIOUS about the bread being used on their sandwiches. What you are looking for is called an ""italian baguette"" which is going to be soft but chewy on the inside and just a little crispy on the outside. In theory, a true kaiser roll (not that shit in a bag) should be relatively similar even though it doesn't have the right aesthetic at all. Seeded rolls are the best. 

The meat/bread ratio varies between 2/1 and 1/2, so really just your preference between there.",food,1

The cake consists of an 8in vanilla cake sandwiched between two 8in chocolate cakes. In between each layer is a layer of the peanut butter frosting.

Recipe:
For the Caramel
1/2 cup (113 grams) unsalted butter (1 stick)
1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream or heavy whipping cream (36-40% butterfat content)
3 tablespoons water
1/4 cup (60 ml) light corn syrup
1 cup (200 grams) sugar
1/2 teaspoon course or flaked sea salt

In a tall sided sauce pan combine water, sugar, and corn syrup. Bring to a boil and cook to 340F.  Resist the urge to stir. Swirl the pan lightly a few times throughout cooking to prevent hot spots. as soon as 340F is hit, drop in your cream and butter. Now you can stir. It will bubble furiously, which is why you need a tall sided pot. Return to the heat and cook to 240F or the soft ball stage. This will yield a soft a chewy caramel. Pour into a heavily greased 8""x8"". Let stand at room temp for 30 minutes.  Then dose liberally with a quality finishing salt like fleur de sel, or Maldon. let stand for another 60 mins.  If you're too afraid or not adventurous enough to make your own caramel, you could use Kraft caramel cubes. Be warned though they are considerably firmer and the finished product will suffer!

For the Cookie:
1 cup of butter divided into 2 1/2 cup portions
1  light brown sugar
2 tsp quality vanilla extract (no artificial please)
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 large egg
1 egg yolk
2 and 1/4 cups AP flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda.
1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecan (or nut of your choosing)
Preheat oven to 350F
In a small sauce pan put a 1/2 cup butter. Cook over medium heat until it no longer sizzles and all the water is cooked out. Continue cooking for another 3-4 minutes until the butter is dark brown and smells nutty. Pour into a bowl and reserve. 

In the work bowl of your mixer combine the other half of your butter and the brown sugar. Cream on high for 5 minutes until light and fluffy. Next pour in the cooled brown butter and granulated sugar. Continue to beat on high for another 2 minutes adding the eggs 1 at a time. Texture should be light and fluffy and very soft. Sift dry ingredients, turn mixer down to low and add in 3 doses. Mix until combined. Fold in pecans with a rubber spatula. Evacuate dough from the bowl and wrap tightly. Place in your fridge at let rest for 30 mins. 

Meanwhile, turn your caramel out onto and cutting board and portion them into 1""x1"" squares using a lightly greased knife or pizza wheel.

Pull dough out of the fridge and portion into 1oz balls. Stuff each one with a caramel portion. Ensure the caramel is totally covered by the dough to prevent ruptures. Lightly grease a 2"" muffin tin and drop each ball into a slot. Sprinkle each ball with a moderate amount of finishing salt. Bake in the middle rack of your oven for 12-15 minutes. Cookies should be lightly brown around the edges and still quite soft on top. Turn out onto a cooling rack and let stand upside down for at least 5 minutes before devouring.",food,0

"WAY faster to skin!  I hunt waterfowl and they are kind of different with the skin, but a little closer skinned.  Either braised or bacon wrapped roasted is the way to go.  Braised you can get away with cooking it well done; bacon wrapped roasted I suggest medium rare.  Duck gets a liver-ish taste to it the longer it's cooked (though it shouldn't be as much of a concern with farm raised).  Offer to pluck your own in the future, worth the effort to get all of that tasty tasty white snowy fat!

"I can definitely see what you're saying here, and I think it's a valid viewpoint. 

On the other hand, sometimes people know the basics and the traditional way of making the dish but choose to do something different because they feel that their take may be somehting better suited to their tastes, or they might want to try something different.

I guess it's hard to know the knowledge of the OP and whether he isn't following tradition out of ignorance or choice. But I think that people who know a lot about a certain kind of cuisine always assume that it's out of ignorace because they're set in the mindset of ""traditional is best"", ""traditional is right"".

Now, the impetus for this little rant I had was from a cuisine that I'll admit I don't know much about and would love to hear how to make my dish more authentic. But the person didn't do that. They simply said it was wrong and an insult to their culture and walked off without telling me how the dish is traditionally done, which I feel is very counterproductive and does nothing but further that person's persecution complex.

But I also have been called out by people from cultures that I know a lot about, where I know the traditional way of cooking something but specifically choose to do something different because I cook what tastes good to me. I don't cook simply because of tradition.",food,0

"So these are my tips for preparing octopus at home. This way octopus turns out extremely tender but still has enough bite.

This is the result: http://i.imgur.com/6aAsltB.jpg

You'll need a pot of water. I like to add some spices and white wine. Bring it to the boiling point. Throw in your octopus. If you have a thermometer try to bring the water temperature to about 90°c. If you don't then bring the water back to the boiling point and then turn down the heat. The water should be steaming but not boiling. Don't cover the pot.

2 hours later turn off the heat and let everything cools down to about 45°c. Don't drain the water early - don't remove the octopus early.

Remove the octopus and separate the tentacles. The skin should be pretty soft and rather slimy. Gently cut into the skin along the line of the suckers. Remove the skin besides the area of the suckers.

Now chill the tentacles over night. Bring back to room temperature and sear or grill.

I think between the salted pasta water, salty parmesan cheese, and salty pancetta, I overdid it somewhere. Will have to cut back next time.",food,0

"But stout beer is in a league of its own in my opinion. The flavor is very deep and distinctive and unmistakable. And although IPA is different than lager, when you get it down to its basic essence (i.e deep frying), I doubt you would eat a piece of fish and say ""oh this was definitely made with IPA"". So to me, it's pointless to even mention it. I remember reading this whole piece on why it's pointless to use expensive wine when cooking because all of the nuances are lost during the cooking process anyway. And there was some prestigious chef mentioned who said he just uses cheap wine from a jug to cook with. 

Now I'm probably going to get downvoted to hell by saying this, but I find the posts where people take pictures of dishes they cooked to be mildly irritating anyway, because to me it's just a ""look at me and how wonderful I am"" type of thing. To me, that's really social media in a nutshell. So I admit, my comment was a bit snarky, but that is why.

I have a lot of cabbage too (not one giant one like you, but a few smaller cabbages, and other than adding them to soups and sauteeing them in garlic/EVOO, I'm not sure what else to do with them.
