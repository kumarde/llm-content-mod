"It never ceases to surprise me these days with Reddit. I went back to old mass shooting/violence threads to see some comparisons.

**Anders Breivik:**

(Breivik declared insane and unaccountable for attacks)

> Makes me proud of my country.
Edit: .....of the occasional progress in human morality and ethics.
> > A justice system where revenge isn't the motivating factor for punishment is certainly something to be proud of. One of the big achievements a society can make.
>> > Thank you.
This is the correct punishment. Rehabilitation and treatment, not punishment and hate.

---
(Breivik declared sane)
> I am a bit disappointed in the comments so far, calling him a terrorist, calling for the death penalty, or calling him a c%nt. I am not directly disputing the semantics of whether he is a terrorist or a c%nt. I just think they divert attention, energy and understanding away from the fact that Breivik's actions highlight social problems that we like to ignore.

> We should be talking about how our society allowed Anders to become so isolated and jaded with regards to other cultures. We should delve in to why he felt that the only way of making a difference in the world was to kill innocent people. It may be a symptom of the fact that the idea of a 'community' is lost in large western cities. It may also be that the education system makes no room for understanding other cultures and helping kids see past the obvious differences to the shared humanity. It may also be that the political systems with which 'average' people have to influence the direction of a country (i.e. throwing a vote into the paper pile) disarms the passionate and stifles the options they have to explore their thoughts.

> I am not trying to excuse what Breivik did, but we need to look past the evil in what he did, and past the names with which we define it, and see if we can learn something about ourselves and the way we live from his actions.

> For every man that thrashes out in an act of violence against a system that stifles him, there are many more brilliant, passionate people that recline into apathy after their voices fall on deaf ears.

**Isla Vista:**

> Shall we blame this on ""Affluenza"" as well. This was a very disturbed young man. Had he gotten the affection and sex he so desired he would have still been a psychopath. His rejection, whether real or imagined, was simply his trigger to act on thoughts he was already harbouring.
> > You judge this man, and you judge that his rejection, and possibly life alone would not have effected his mind or thoughts, by saying something so ridiculously you show you've never even taken an intro to psych course. We are shaped greatly by our surroundings, specifically our social connections. We are a social species. A species that uses solitary confinement as one of the worst punishments Some of us live in solitary confinement, through no choice of our own, and it does cause significant mental health issues. If you believe otherwise, you are lying to yourself, and frankly ignoring all the evidence.

---
> It's interesting how carefully reddit seems to be avoiding discourse about how he was a bitter entitled MRA-citing misogynist, why isn't that being discussed?
I mean, we all know, but I'd love to hear it from someone else
> > I've been looking for this same discussion. This mentality of ""I am a nice guy so why won't these stupid sluts won't give me the sex I am rightfully entitled to"" is prevalent on reddit. I'd say the odds are high that he was a mra/redpiller.
> > > Doubtful since the shooter expressed fantasies of male genocide.

> > > ""He posted in 2013, 'If you could release a virus that would kill every single man on Earth, except for yourself because you would have the antidote, would you do it? You will be the only man left, with all the females. You would be able to have your pick of any beautiful woman you want, as well as having dealt vengeance on the men who took them from you. Imagine how satisfying that would be.""

> >  I mean, I'd put a lot more stock into mental illness than his MRA ideas in terms of what to blame, but imagine if it was an article about a woman murdering men who checked her out. I can only imagine the anti-feminism generalizations and ""see, men are oppressed!!"" discussions that would dominate the comments.

**Chris Dorner:**

> They fucking Waco'd him. Say what you will about Dorner and his actions, but I'm of the point of view that the police have no fucking business setting people on fire.

> > No due process! Murderer or not the fucker had rights. NBC in LA has been saying for hours a sniper took him out. THEN the cabin burned down. After media outlets were ordered to vacate, Of course. Murderous cops on a vendetta. And they will get away with it.

> > > It's perfectly constitutional to use lethal force when necessary. In a situation where someone is holed up, armed, and already shot two officers in the shootout the law doesn't require that non-lethal force is used to ensure his due process rights.

> > > > You're absolutely right, but I don't think SETTING THEM ON FIRE is technically 'necessary'.

> > > > > TIL ""BURN IT DOWN"" is a swat tactic

**Baltimore Riots:**

Indeed, I think a peaceful Black Lives Matter would have a much more compelling message to white people if they stood in contrast with a black terrorist movement with more radical goals and methods.  Sort of like how Malcolm X played bad cop to Martin Luther King's good cop in the Black Freedom Movement.   In any case, while these police officers who died in Dallas may well not have personally been guilty of brutality against blacks, I don't think that's a worthwhile distinction to make when one's community is being occupied by a hostile military force.

Effectiveness is an important and common concern when choosing a birth control method. Vasectomy is the most effective birth control for men. It is nearly 100 percent effective.
However, vasectomy is not immediately effective. Sperm remains beyond the blocked tubes. You must use other birth control until the sperm are used up. It usually takes about three months. A simple test — semen analysis — shows when there are no more sperm in your ejaculate.

Very rarely, tubes grow back together again and pregnancy may occur. This happens in about 1 out of 1,000 cases.

Why shouldn't the husband be compromising here instead? Especially since him compromising results in a better outcome.

This whole argument seems to be based on a faulty assumption: that compromise is always good. Sometimes the middle ground is awful, for example if the mother and father were arguing over vaccinations, it would be ridiculous to 'compromise' and only get the kid half his vaccinations, or to spread them out, or wait till he's older. 

That would be a situation where the mother would have to put her foot down, point out that the father's requests aren't at all reasonable, and no compromise should be attempted. I feel like a similar argument can definitely be proposed here where, if there is any compromise to be made then it'd be on the part of the husband, who needs to compromise his feelings of discomfort so that his wife's already difficult job doesn't become more difficult.

Since then, two of them quitted because we ""didn't take time to properly explain things to them"" and ""always assume they (the women) knew how things worked or were supposed to work"".

I intend on keeping this policy of never ""dumbing down"" (or simplify, actually)  anything I have to explain to a female colleague. You want to live by the sword, then die by the sword.

She has no regard for context, which is funny since academic feminism is all over context. 

The shame is that there seem to be a lot of shitty women's studies programs with shitty teachers where this shitty methodology is encouraged.

"It's funny that progressives and liberals opposing Trump and his followers think that any kind of progress is going to be made by pacifist means. 

Trump and the right in Europe are Fascists. The only way to stop fascists is with force. They will use force against progressives and liberals and kill them if you do not stop them now. There is no time for playing games of ""oh we're so civilized we can't respond to violence with violence"" in this day and age.

It may of worked when human beings were decent, followed religion, saw black people shot by police, had dogs sicked on them, or hit with water hoses and felt disgusted in their stomach.

If you televised that footage today the majority of Trumps supporters would be cheering. A good 30%-40% would cheer a militarization campaign of Chicago African Minority suburbs that resulted in hundreds of deaths.

You have no idea what is going to be unleashed on this country. You can look at Colombia, Chile, Peru, Greece, and understand what exactly is going on. There will be no place for Progressives, Liberals, or anyone who opposes Trump to hide when the Death Squads start marching. The only way to stop it will be to fight back. Like the resistance did in France and Italy. 

There is a civil war coming and anyone who doesn't realize it is deluding themselves. Anyone who isn't preparing will die at the hands of the Paramilitaries that are already organizing or be forced into labor camps.

The reason why some people consider it unprofessional isn't because we allow neonazi's to exist. We are all disgusted by such behaviour and if you spend a few minutes looking through, you'll see most people are in favour of severe punishments.

That said, as a community manager you have the responsibility to remain neutral and professional in how you communicate. While personally I don't feel it is bad, I can understand that some guys consider the way he said it unprofessional compared to how the company usually handles their communication.

That said,

EVE Online is an online sandbox space MMO where virtually anything is allowed within certain borders. As a result, we have a thriving game where scamming other players is encouraged and espionage is a big part of the game. As the development team wants to run the game in such a way that it's near-lawless (obviously within the borders of EULA/TOS etc), it also attracts these edgy fuckers that pretend to be neonazi's to shock people.

"It highly depends how exactly the stuff is arranged and perceived, I guess.

What would you think if you and some guy decided to order a pizza, for $16 + $3 delivery, except he had a free delivery coupon, but he insisted that you still pay $9 instead of your $8 half of what the pizza actually cost (and he paid $7 then)? It's more profitable for you than paying the full cost, right?

I'd feel exploited because he's not just getting free delivery, he's getting the $1 extra from me. And precisely because there's hard cold money involved instead of a barter-like favors or something, it feels that he suddenly changed our relationship from buddies to buyers and sellers or something.

It's as if you helped a friend to move, but then instead of buying you a beer or something he compensated you according to the going minimum wage rate. Yeah, it'd probably be a better deal than the beer actually, but a gross violation of the way that sort of social interaction was supposed to work.",SubredditDrama,0

"&gt;By bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern capitalists, owners of the means of social production and employers of wage labour. 

-Frederick Engels, 1888 edition of The Communist Manifesto

Unless they all own means of production (own businesses) and all employ workers in their business, they are not part of the bourgeoisie, or *capitalist class*.

You might mean *petty* or *petit bourgeoisie*, which is generally what Marx and Engels referred to when they used the term middle-class. However that again has a specific meaning: either a) a social strata of people who own means of production but do not employ wage labour e.g individual craftsmen, self-employed people running their own business (themselves), programmers selling their own software, etc. Or b) a social strata of people who sell their labour like the proletariat (working class), but can have the same class interests as the bourgeoisie because of their privilleged position in class society- people like middle-managers, accountants, corporate lawyers- who aid the bourgeoisie in managing the means of production, but do not actually own them. Part of this strata may accumulate enough capital to join the bourgeois class, or may own things like stocks in companies (and so have a vested interest in maintaining class society).

It is very unlikely that every socialist on Reddit- or indeed every socialist- can be classified under any of these definitions. Its pretty clear you're just trying to paint anyone opposed to the existing economic structure as naive, privilleged children.

Catalonia is definitely controversial.... thousands upon thousands of clergy, business owners and other ""bourgeoisie"" types were slaughtered extra judicially, and had their property seized.

"&gt;OK. I'm gonna suppose you're american and put the following example from the perspective of someone that opposes the agreement.
Ready? Here we go...

&gt;There's a group that has managed to exert territorial control over certain areas of the US. Let's name them American Front for National Liberation (AFNL). During the span of 50 years, they have performed the following actions:

&gt;-During a New Year celebration in the Trump Tower with wealthy people, this group set car bombs that killed 36 and injured 200 and destroyed the building. There were about 600 in the building.

&gt;-The group have managed to gain influence in the SJW groups and they have resorted to violent tactics during protests. These AFNL sponsored and training groups have learned and constantly use make-shift mortars, stone tube-launchers, molotov cocktails and makeshift grenades with screws, nails, and human feces as shrapnel... When facing the riot police, that does not have rifles or pistols, but batons, shields, water jets and gas grenades. 
&gt;Everytime these protests happen, SJW groups raid and vandalize the nearby malls and bars. Tens, if not hundred of policemen have died because of the make-shift weapons, but the police or the military cannot go inside the universities to track and capture, because the US Supreme Court ruled against it, as it violated civil liberties.

&gt;-A panhandler, whose family used to have lots of lands and cattle, had been driven to poverty because of a constant monetary extortion performed by the commanders of this group. One day, her father refused to pay the money, so the group kidnapped and murdered him and forced his remaining faimily to hand the property papers. After the signing was complete, they notified the family that they had 24 hours to pack their shit and vacate the property. If they happen to find anybody after the 24 hrs, they will be killed, no exceptions. This beger was from Los Angeles and has fled to New York because of this, taking with her nothing else but what she could carry in her backpack.

&gt;-The right-wing group that was created originally to defend other people from the AFNL, but that also uses all the tactics listed above and below, have built a camp in the urban area of Ferguson, a territory that AFNL had in control for a lot of time. AFNL gave them an ultimatum to leave; they told him to go fuck himself. The right-wing group have set their camps next to civilian houses and institution, though they do not want neither of them in the town. In order to soften the defenses in preparation for the recapture of the town, the AFNL group uses gas-cilinders as mortars. One gas cilinder lands inside a church where the civilians were hiding and explodes. 119 are dead and 98 are wounded. From the dead, 47 were children.

&gt;-In a rural town in Texas that has cattle as its main product, it's pretty common for cows to roam freely in the streets. One of this cows approaches the police station and then a big explosion happens. 11 policemen die. The cow was loaded with dynamite and a remote detonator.

&gt;-In New Mexico, the Albuquerque main police station with 120 policemen is under attack by an AFNL militia composed by 500 combatants and outer security rings with 1500 more. In order to capture the town, AFNL uses grenade-launchers, mortars and heavy machine gun fire on them and nearby houses, town hall and churches in order to deny them cover. After 12 hours of continuous combat, Albuquerque falls, with 16 policemen dead and 61 that surrendered. The ones that surrendered are taken away and held as hostages/POW for 14 years, forced to march in the jungle in order to evade the US Army attempts to rescue them. Some of these captured policemen will die while in captivity.

&gt;-A group of men with ANFL bands arrive into a rural town, and makes a call for absolutely every villager to show up at the town hall. When literally everyone is there, an ANFL militia commander reads 15 names and they are dragged to the stage. The man claims that what's gonna happen next will be experienced by anyone who cooperates with the police, Army or the right-wing militia. The 15 men are shot in the head, the women are raped and then killed. All in front of the whole village. This happens sporadically all over Texas, California, New Mexico, Florida and Arizona.

&gt;-After 20 years of war, president Ronald Reagan calls for a peace agreement with this group. As a show of goodwill, he orders the US Army to retreat from certain areas in order to facilitate the arrival of the ANFL combatants and negotiators. There are rumours that the ANFL is building trenches, foxholes and fortifications in these areas, but in order to not damage the negotiations, the media makes no mention of it. One day, when Ronald Reagan is waiting for the ANFL commander for the dialogues, nobody shows up and only after 4 hours a low ranking ANFL member arrives and says that the commander thinks the zone is not safe and will not go. All of this on national television. Oh, and also the rumours were effectively true.
Add this:

&gt;-The US government for 40 years have used terms to dehumanize the ANFL, referring to them solely as bandits, terrorists, scumbags, vile scourge, communists, etc.

&gt;-You live in Montana and none of these things have happened to you, but you have seen for your whole life these events via TV as they unfold.

&gt;-Your girlfriend has never met her father because he was a policeman during the attack on Albuquerque, and he has been a hostage since she was 1 year old.

&gt;After 45 years of war, Barack Obama says that ANFL want to make a peace agreement, that they will depose their weapons, they will receive training and education in order to fit the civil society once again and that while some of them will go to jail, if others acknowledge and confess their crimes they may go 5-8 years into a special camp that will not be a jail but a boarding school in the rural areas. After this they are free and can even participate in politics and be elected for government positions. And although it's completely false, Kim Kardashian, Trump and Justin Bieber have been saying to all of their fans that the ANFL leader will be designated as POTUS if the agreement is signed.

&gt;With all honesty: Wouldn't you feel a bit riled up about this proposal after knowing all that happened above? Wouldn't you expect someone to be deluded and fall for the disinformation parts?

... I mean, I'd be pretty pissed if all this happened in the US...",SubredditDrama,0
