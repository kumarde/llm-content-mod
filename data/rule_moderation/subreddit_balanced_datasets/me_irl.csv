"I find it disturbing when people say they're ""anti social""... I mean I know what they mean when they say it because you know the whole language evolving thing... But damn it still sort of creeps me out.

When you want to brag about how autistic you are but don't want to sound like you have fantasies of skinning me alive and fucking my stab wounds, the proper non creep term is ""asocial"".",me_irl,1

"I see two possible loopholes:

1. Maybe it's only valid if it gets exactly 10,000 upvotes.  He didn't say ""at least 10k"" or ""10k or more""

2. His handwriting is messy enough that the word after ""top post"" almost looks like the word ""or"".  Meaning he could tattoo ""me_irl"" on his ass.  

I personally think he should go with Loophole #2.",me_irl,1

"Dude thats nothing. I was swimming with sharks during my summer break, and he bit my leg off, my friend was like, dude that must hurt and I was laughing and shit. Then he took another bite and got my left hand clean off, my friend was like dude you're left handed, this is terrible, I just kept laughing harder because I'm so strong. The blood was spraying now, and really starting to attract a lot more sharks, my mate is like, hey I see like 10 more fins coming towards you, get out of the water! I laughed and laughed, then I was pulled under and my friend could still hear me laughing until they got my neck and it became muffled gurgles underwater. Classic sharks, easily the funniest day of the summer, almost as good as the time I went hunting for wolverines.

"I have crippling anxiety and autism. I get the same feeling you would if you were in literal mortal danger every time I try to talk to somebody, so the only way to really understand would maybe ask a homeless crack head to jump out of the bushes and stab you and remember you feel that everytime you try to talk to somebody or leave your house. Also because autism it means I have hangover haering/sight/everything all the time. Which leads to the same feeling and worse feelings. It's pretty shit.

This subreddit has without a doubt gone down substantially in quality and lately even the 'highs' are lower quality than before.

The Alt Right isn't national socialist. They just believe in preserving a western identity. Being proud of your ethnicity and county of origin has become taboo if you're white and so the Alt Right wants to preserve white ethno-nationalism.,me_irl,1

"I remember this conversation I had in high school speech class with this kid that ate, shit, and breathed call of duty. 

One particular day he wouldn't shut up about how bad-ass he'd be with a 50 cal sniper rifle in real life. I told him he probably couldn't get it loaded, much less line up a shot. He started getting visibly upset as the other students around our desk start to listen in on what he's getting heated about. He keeps reiterating that it's not hard, I throw in that I could run him down with a little knife from thousands of yards out jogging a straight line and he still wouldn't figure it out. 
This sets him off and his volume has the attention of like half the room, and I realize I'm in a very public totally nonsense conversation with the kid who tells strangers about prestige emblems. 
Can't stop him now, he's visibly angry. Teacher has to step in and ask what's going on, and an explanation is made. Some other kid in that class had already let the cutest girls know I played WoW as he'd heard I was raiding and felt the need to talk about it, so I was already on thin ice as coming across as normal. This was right after the South Park WoW episode, being known to have played before the episode hit was socially dangerous, lol. The awkward stares while having to explain we're not planning on shooting or stabbing each other, so socially painful. If I had been single at the time it would have hurt so much more.

But yeah, what happens when you argue with the super gun/military kids who talk incredible amounts of shit but haven't even held a gun...",me_irl,1

"If you think about it, this entire sub has gone completely mental. Just imagine what this would all look like without the internet medium between us. First, one guy shows everyone a picture, then everybody else begins laughing and parroting phrases back and forth. Everybody in a room, just repeating shit over and over, ""Me too thanks!"" ""Me too thanks!"" Then someone takes the picture, and draws something else on top of it; usually something we can all recognize from before. And everybody laughs and parrots the same phrase again, ""O shit waddup"" ""90kg projectile!"" ""Me too thanks!"" If you imagine it, it looks like we're all in an insane asylum. In fact, that's really all we do here; just drive each other insane. We keep repeating the same shit over and over until one person finally snaps, and everybody agrees and moves onto something else. Then the whole fucking cycle repeats itself. We're all stuck in the Loony Bin and nobody can escape because we just keep feeding into each other's crippling mental illness.

"If you think about it, this entire sub has gone completely mental. Just imagine what this would all look like without the internet medium between us. First, one guy shows everyone a picture, then everybody else begins laughing and parroting phrases back and forth. Everybody in a room, just repeating shit over and over, ""Me too thanks!"" ""Me too thanks!"" Then someone takes the picture, and draws something else on top of it; usually something we can all recognize from before. And everybody laughs and parrots the same phrase again, ""O shit waddup"" ""90kg projectile!"" ""Me too thanks!"" If you imagine it, it looks like we're all in an insane asylum. In fact, that's really all we do here; just drive each other insane. We keep repeating the same shit over and over until one person finally snaps, and everybody agrees and moves onto something else. Then the whole fucking cycle repeats itself. Give me karma We're all stuck in the Loony Bin and nobody can escape because we just keep feeding into each other's crippling mental illness.

"Hey this is Danny Fresh with a fresh pizza tip for you. Do you want to know how to receive a free Domino's one topping pizza from Domino's Pizzeria and Restaurant?Well sit down, let me tell you. Step 1: Telephone a Domino's Pizza Eatery and Restaurant and order a large one topping pizza and the guy will say, ""What topping would you like?"" And you say, ""I'd like my topping to be another steaming hot Domino's one topping pizza."" So the guy asks, ""What topping would you like on your Domino's one topping pizza topping?"" And then you say, ""Go ahead and make my second Domino's one topping pizza topping a Domino's one topping pizza."" And then the guy will ask, ""Ok sir, what topping would you like on your Domino's one topping pizza topping one topping pizza?"" And you respond with, ""A Domino's one topping pizza."" And continue to order Domino's one topping pizza toppings, until you are at a pizza topped with 71 Domino's one topping pizzas, and then the pizza guy will say, ""Wait one moment, sir. We don't have any pizza boxes that will fit this 71 Domino's one topping pizza topping pizza."" So you say, ""Hold on,"" And quickly run to Home Depot and purchase a Maytag refrigerator which retails for 3,399 US dollars, and when it comes time to pay for the Maytag refrigerator, you offer to pay Home Depot, not with cash, but with 70 piping hot Domino's one topping pizzas, and they of course accept, so you buy the fridge and you take it back to the Domino's Pizzeria Restaurant, you give the pizza guy a Maytag refrigerator box and put the 71 topped Domino's Pizza one topping pizza into that, and then you pay Domino's using a brand new Maytag refrigerator which retails for 3,399 US dollars, so then you take the Maytag refrigerator box filled with a 71 topped Domino's one topping pizza back to Home Depot, and you give it to the cashier there as payment for your brand new Maytag refrigerator which retails for 3,399 US dollars, and when the cashier turns his back to get your receipt, you snatch the 71st Domino's one topping pizza off the top of your Domino's one topping pizza stack and you put it in your pocket, and there you have yourself a completely free steaming hot Domino's one topping pizza!",me_irl,1

"This just happened to me the other day.   
  
I was trying to login to the bank which I have a loan through for my car so I could make a payment, note this was my first car ever and I just got it a few months ago.   
  
Since it was a new laptop I had to answer a security question to login. The security question was, ""What was the make and model of your first car?"" Naturally I put the type of car I just bought which is the only reason I even have this bank login, and it was wrong! I have no idea if I made a typo or something but I was so annoyed. Then I had to verify my ID but you needed to put in your debit card number which I don't have.  
  
 If someone really wants to login to my bank to make my car payment, please just let them next time. ",me_irl,1

"Let's clarify something: your claim wasn't ""no capitalist economists believe communism is beneficial"" (you can see how this is practically tautological, though, right?). Rather, your claim was ""no educated person believes communism is beneficial to people"" -- this, I've shown, is categorically false. To this other point though, as for a respected economist who thinks, for instance, Marxism has merit, we could consider Ha-Joon Chang, who served as a consultant to the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, as well as to Oxfam and various United Nations agencies. This is to say, he's about as ""establishment"" as you can get. He studied under Robert Rowthorn, a leading British Marxist economist, and happens to list Karl Marx as one of his greatest influences -- Rowthorn himself is also worth mentioning, given his ties to the IMF (which is about as mainstream a financial institution you can think of). We could also consider Richard D. Wolff who, while not nearly as ""mainstream"" as the other two thinkers, is still a fairly well-regarded Marxist economist. These are just three examples off the top of my head. 

We should clarify something else as well: capitalism isn't just an economic system -- it's a political system as well. Of course, this isn't any sort of novel or arcane knowledge; this was recognized nearly 300 years ago by Adam Smith, the ""father of modern capitalism"" and pioneer of political economy. If we want to take the example of Chomsky -- an historian, political scientist, and political economist -- he has more than enough expertise to comment on some of the failings of capitalist political economy (failings that more orthodox economists are not prone to examine or even notice).",me_irl,0
