Here is a [**resolution from the American Medical Association**](http://www.tgender.net/taw/ama_resolutions.pdf) on the efficacy and necessity of transition as appropriate treatment for gender dysphoria, and call for an end to insurance companies categorically excluding transition-related care from coverage.

I had a formal logic course with an *excellent* textbook and homework software, and I probably only attended about half of the lectures because I genuinely didn't need to.

"I have probably 30 or so ""staple"" recipes, plus more that come and go based on the season, plus more that get made once a year or so. The core of the meal plan is the proteins I buy at Costco: I'll buy two or three different kinds on each shopping trip, then cook my way through them before I buy more. I buy veggies, beans and lentils, pasta, etc for meatless meals from a conventional grocery store. Each time I cook, we eat leftovers the next day. 

So if I buy salmon, I'll usually make cedar plank grilled salmon or [miso-glazed salmon](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015115-miso-glazed-fish). Pork tenderloin: grilled or shishkebabs. Chicken breasts: souvlaki, grilled breasts with vinaigrette, stir fry, chicken salad. Shrimp: [curry](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018037-tamarind-shrimp-with-coconut-milk) or [broiled Greek style shrimp](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015194-greek-style-broiled-shrimp). A rotisserie chicken will be served sliced with rice and greens on the side, then sliced on a bun for a chicken sandwich, then I'll make a soup from the bones. These are the staple proteins and the favored recipes that go along with them.

My husband is British and loves lamb, so when he gets his favorites, it's a lamb leg from Costco made into something like [this moussaka](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/moussaka-recipe.html), a shepherd's pie, lamb curry or carne adovada made from lamb. Last week I asked what I should shop for and he requested ""something meaty"" so I made [this](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017937-mississippi-roast).

I love vegetables and beans/lentils and I like eating light, so when I get my favorites it's usually meatless and seasonal. I've made [this](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017128-lentil-salad-with-roasted-vegetables) twice already this winter. We have it meatless with a sprinkle of feta on top, then the next night with a grilled sausage on the side.

Oh, there's also always something my husband can make for himself if I'm gone or something unexpected happens. This is rare so it has to be fairly nonperishable. Currently it's a bag of frozen meatballs, jarred spaghetti sauce and frozen spinach, and a container of frozen posole.",Showerthoughts,1

Social anxiety, being shy, social inexperience, and low self esteem all have nothing to do with introversion but are all always conflated with it.

It's pretty stupid, really. You don't get invited. Then you work yourself up. Then you ask to join the party that you weren't previously invited to and you get the green light.

And it's not like I sit there sulking the entire time or anything. Sometimes I just genuinely don't find the activities we do fun, nevermind the fact that you have to be there the whole time knowing you were initially left out, and at the end of the night you just kinda say ""Well, truthfully, I'd be happier if I just stayed home.""

So I spent my night learning I wasn't invited, securing my own invitation, and, in the end, not having fun. But you'll sure as hell do it again next time because maybe it beats being home alone.

Homing pigeons homing in
They fly through my doors,
And they crawl out on all fours

Welcome, Monsieur, sit yourself down
And meet the best innkeeper in town
As for the rest, all of 'em crooks:
Rooking their guests and crooking the books
Seldom do you see
Honest men like me
A gent of good intent
Who's content to be

Master of the house, doling out the charm
Ready with a handshake and an open palm
Tells a saucy tale, makes a little stir
Customers appreciate a bon-viveur
Glad to do a friend a favor
Doesn't cost me to be nice
But nothing gets you nothing
Everything has got a little price!

Master of the house, keeper of the zoo
Ready to relieve 'em of a sou or two
Watering the wine, making up the weight
Pickin' up their knick-knacks when they can't see straight
Everybody loves a landlord
Everybody's bosom friend
I do whatever pleases
Jesus! Won't I bleed 'em in the end!

Master of the house, quick to catch yer eye

Everybody's chaperone
But lock up your valises

Plus some little extras on the side!
(Oh Santa!)

Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice
Two percent for looking in the mirror twice
Here a little slice, there a little cut
Three percent for sleeping with the window shut
When it comes to fixing prices
There are a lot of tricks I knows
How it all increases, all them bits and pieces
Jesus! It's amazing how it grows!

(Oh, sorry love
Let's get something done about that)
I used to dream that I would meet a prince
But God Almighty, have you seen what's happened since?

What a cruel trick of nature landed me with such a louse
God knows how I've lasted living with this bastard in the house!

Master of the house!
Master and a half!
Comforter, philosopher
Don't make me laugh!
Servant to the poor, butler to the great

"I agree with you in that returning to college is not necessarily a haven to require more skills in a specific profession, but I disagree with your notion that the quality of life is much better once specialized in a profession. Homework is not a reversed departure from reality, but either a simulation of reality as a professional, or a means of utilizing the closing timeframe for a young brains plasticity to it's extent as well as maximizing societies investment in their education (for high school, because it's our last chance to educate teens before granting them electoral voice and adult privilege). This is, of course, entirely based upon the profession. 

As a surgeon well into his training as a neurosurgeon, I can tell you that I spend far more time at home reading papers, reading textbooks, and writing manuscripts and grants for research in my off time than I did studying or working as an undergrad (and I worked my ass off in college and medical school).

I don't know what life is like as a software programer, but in my field it takes decades to reach mastery, and only so little time if you read and study religiously in your off time. You would simply fail to succeed if you didn't study at home with potent dedication. 

I am salaried however, so maybe that is the difference. I am expected to demonstrate continued significant improvement, and there is too much work to be done during the 12 to 30 hours straight that I am physically at work to gain this competency, and so I am expected to study in my off hours.

I am a bit of a unique player, though, and a exception of my own statement. For me, schoolwork is very similar to my jobs requirements because part of my job is education. Essentially I am paid a small fraction of my value as an employee (I make about 50K a year and earn the hospital well over a million a year in consultation and procedure costs without supervision) because I am ""paid"" hundreds of thousands in masterful education yearly.

"&gt; it's fair to say many stars in the constellation are relatively close to each other on an interstellar scale.

On the contrary, constellation stars are often farther apart from each other than they are from earth, as is the case for Orion. It's correct to point out that stars in a constellation are in fact *not* relatively close to each other on any scale.

&gt; I'm not saying that the stars in constellations are basically in the same location, but a lot of the stars we notice are the bright ones that are nearby, so it's not always as completely random as people assume.

By that criterion, *all* visible stars in the sky are in ""the same area in space."" That's like saying that every house in a city is in the same part of the country. Technically correct, but misleading as to what constellations actually are.

Constellation stars are all in the same general *direction* as seen from earth, but their radial distribution is randomized in space (modulo the biasing effect of brighter stars being visible from farther away).",Showerthoughts,0
