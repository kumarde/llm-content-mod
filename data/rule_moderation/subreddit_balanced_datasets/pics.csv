If your argument is reasonable, the conversation will be reasonable. If not then I'll end up shit posting and laughing at you.

>I use objectification in this context to describe the historical tradition of forcing women into purely sexual roles.

Let's assume this is completely true. We'll just chuck out Metroid, Chrono Trigger, and every other classic game that featured strong female leads that weren't sexualized. We'll assume your premise is true. Now:

So what? What's wrong with sexualizing women in video games?

>Obviously we are starting to deviate from that which is awesome, but female characters in games (including Overwatch) still continue a long tradition of over sexualizing women.

What level of sexualization do you find to be acceptable? By what metric do you assert that these characters are over-sexualized and not acceptably sexualized or under-sexualized?

But if someone says it's a repost, oh the horror... suddenly no one likes the content anymore. How can you like something and then decide you don't like if you find out it's old.

"Nah, there's much more than that. Sikhs are duty bound by their religion to help and protect people. They feed millions for free every day in India because they see it as their religious duty. As an ideology, it's up there with Buddhism as far as acting like a decent human being goes. 

Islam on the other hand... well, 

The punishment for apostasy in Islam is DEATH. This is the only religion that murders people for leaving it.   

The punishment for adultery is STONING TO DEATH. Women are uniquely disadvantaged here as they are buried up to their necks while men only up to their chests.    

The punishment for homosexuality is islam is DEATH.  

The *punishment* for getting raped in islam is whipping. 

Women are treated like second class citizens and can't drive, show their hair or body parts, get a divorce, or often work outside the home. They also can't vote or own property. They ARE property.   

Close to 90% of muslims worldwide hate gays 

More than 50% of all British muslims think homosexuality should be ILLEGAL. Again, the punishment for homosexuality in islam is DEATH. That means that if you're a British gay man and invite 4 muslims over for diner, odds are 2 of them think you should be put to death. 

10 Muslim countries have the DEATH PENALTY for being gay

"A reverse image search led to this wide angle shot which gives us clues as to why it's built like this.
It appears to be a connection between two artificial lakes for a waterway in the Netherlands, and you can clearly see it is big enough for (small) boats to pass through. There's little risk of flooding if it is an artificial lake, since the water level can be easily controlled with dams, reservoirs, etc because if any people know how to manage and control water, it's the Dutch. It's likely the road was there before the smaller lake and the canal were built, so when they built the canal, they had to move the road. They made it a tunnel instead of a bridge since it's easier to just dig a hole than to build a bridge over the canal.
So yes, it is good engineering.",pics,1

"I know a lot of it was my school but a lot of schools are shitty.  My story isn't all that unique.   Go to r/studentnurse its all over.  They set us up for failure.  One teacher straight up lied to us.   Said xyz won't be on the test and xyz was on the test.  There was no way to win and they don't include people like me who withdrawal in the stats.  Just fucking awful.  There was no males or minorities after the 2nd semester.   I feel like they stole my money.  Until the boards take into account total attrition rate the schools could literally fail 95% of the students and still be accredited.  All hail their almighty nclex pass rate.

It's such a racket.  We had a girl who was in her last semester at another school.  She withdrew for medical.  Went back and got deathly sick again. Got like a 77%.  She is done.   Needed 78 to pass and the school was on drop/one fail you are out.  She had to start over day one at another school.  It doesn't have to be that way.

"The day of September 31st, I was home alone, watching Shrek. I heard a ring at the doorbell, and walked over. Looking out the door, I saw a car driving away, and a small package sitting on the doorstep. Curious, I brought it inside and unwrapped it. It was a case with “Jacob Slendtorius” written on it in Comic Sans. Confused, I scratched my head and pulled out the case. I opened it up, and inside was a CD. I placed the CD in my CD player and white noise played. I heard scratching at my window, and as I approached, the noise on the CD got louder, and so did the scratching. My heart was racing. Faint noises of breath hitting a microphone sounded from the CD. I listened closer - it was Jacob Sartorius’s distorted mixtape. The sound of autotune echoed in the background. Suddenly, from my window, I saw a beanied, gnome-like figure, the stench of popcorn singeing my nose. Behind him was a tall, dark figure wearing a sweatshirt and bearing the most hideous of braces. The mixtape, the gnome figure, the scratching - I knew it could be only one thing. It was Jacob Slendtorius - I thought he was just an urban legend, but the hideous beast was standing mere meters away from me. “WHAT IS UP DRAMALERTNATION, LET’S GET ROIIIIGHT INTO THE NEWS,” the gnome whispered. I screamed, and my ears began to bleed. The taller figure - the one I had now recognized to be Jacob Slendtorius, slowly walked forward. Frantically, I pulled up the YouTube app on my phone and disliked all of his videos and unsubscribed. The Slendtorius approached me slowly and awkwardly, now only feet away. In a raspy, pre-pubescent, autotuned voice, with a menacing chuckle and intrusive grin, he told me that I could wear his sweatshirt. “I don’t want to, please, leave me alone.” I replied. His grin dropped and his face went blank. He came closer, making me increasingly uncomfortable. He warned me that if I do not post this on Reddit, I will be forced to listen to his mixtape for the rest of my life, and he will make me “wear his sweatshirt.” The Slendtorius left seven lyric pages and self-advertisements and promotions on the ground, and forced me to hide them in the forest. He vanished into the night, along with his smaller gnome figure. I took the god-forsaken CD, and attempted to break it - but it wouldn’t crack. Hammered it, scratched it, threw it, sat on it, digested it - but it wouldn’t break. I put it in the CD player once more, and it was a message from the Slendtorius. “You must share this CD, give it to an unsuspecting person, and do not mention me. You will otherwise be forever cursed, just like this CD.” I put it in the mail to a random address, and my life has been normal ever since. I had my phone on me at the time, and was able to take a few pictures for proof. I took pictures of the CD case, the silhouette of the Slendtorius at my window, and a few other pictures that ended up being corrupted. These are those images: http://imgur.com/a/14UhC http://imgur.com/a/mg864 2spoopy4me",pics,1

Your article on all of trumps scandals is just a rant full of speculation about the trump foundation. Lol oh the charity didn't complete the audit? I think I know someone else who doesn't do audits.. the USA. 

""Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, is already investigating the Trump Foundation""     funny how not concrete this 'proof' is

""Newsweek reported that Trump may have broken laws ""   oh he may have? lets all flip shit this is so concrete

Oh and then accusations that he invested in cuba which he did not.. dude I really don't see a single 'scandal' in that article nor do I see ANYTHING CONCRETE.

So it basically boils down to :

&gt;criticisms about DT's ignorance, his hatred, his pomposity, his lack of concern for other people

You got your feelings hurt and now you don't like the guy, you want to find anything you can to match the hillary corruption in your face..   Please point out one concrete 'scandal' in that article rofl

And that direct quote that you are so enraged about, was about a twitter post that was a joke, and is not important to POTUS responsibilities in the first place.. but keep trying

But yeah tell me to do my homework, tell me I am too young to understand, defend the most corrupt politician with a rebuttal full of empty speculation that ultimately boils down to 'hes mean!'


And I won't go all ad hominem at the end and tell you to do your fucking homework you fucking kid, I will instead educate you a bit more myself.  If you get your dear clinton presidency #2 that you want so much, heres what you should expect:

"What the fuck are you attempting to communicate? That was some of the most convoluted drivel I have ever attempted to comprehend. Also, your 'writing skills' are beyond abysmal:

&gt;And with the incessant name calling, it's just icing on the cake; your attempts at rational thought, pathetic as they maybe, are more then enough to prove many, many points of how wrong your ilk are.

That is one of the most egregious run-on sentences I have ever read. I assume English is your second or third language? Your incorrect homonym selection of 'maybe' (perhaps or possibly) instead of 'may be' (could be) certainly suggests that English is not your native tongue. If English IS your first language, you just showed yourself to be more ignorant than an elementary schoolchild. That is the rudimentary level of that grammatical error; its one that CHILDREN make.

"It never occurred to me but that is an excellent way to prevent overdose!  A nice, slow delivery system wherein they pass out before consuming enough to die.  What happens if they pass out with it in their mouth, though?  Or what happens if they chew it up and swallow it to get the drugs faster?  Could the manufacturers  put some sort of nasty tasting emetic in the inner layers to prevent from chomping down and eating the whole thing?  Then if someone chewed up and swallowed the whole thing it would taste like BitterYuck on the way down and then come right back up again before overdose.  But then someone who wasn't abusing it would know when to stop as soon as they hit the bad taste?

"Idk if that is still true, idk if there is anything intrinsic in fentanyl that cooks purple, and there are now many types of fentanyl that lace heroin. Its hard to know if they cook purple and if the purple is from a byproduct of particular synthesis  of fentanyl. Furthermore, more than just fentanyl laces heroin from cocaine to potentially toxic filler.

Also, many users actively look for batches that are laced because its more potent. 

The problem is you never know with a new batch what the potency is. Some users shoot a test dose with any new batch, but otherwise until you shoot you don't know what going to happen and the potency can vary on order of magnitude depending on the type of fentanyl and how much. ALso how long it sticks around in the system is variable.

We read the letter, looked at the mini crate, calculated the size, and approximate weight, ""Does that mean the whole crate is....."" then we were scrambling to pry open the crate. Yup, whole thing was essentially a solid brick of various bars of chocolate, many we had never seen before.We spent a fair while dividing it up between us, and we all went home with a sizeable bag of goodies.

"No, snakes do have personalities, and specific snakes do like hanging out with specific other snakes and not hanging out with others. I think rattlesnakes are particularly social.

I'm not going to argue about their small brains meaning less emotional range, and not going to argue about their reaction to humans, since that's pretty outside their normal behavior, but individual snakes do have consistent traits like curiosity or shyness that distinguish them from others of their species. And they can be social, especially with babies, who sometimes warm up on top of the darker, larger adults who put up with it, and grow faster because of it ( baby snakes usually are lighter, and gather less sun, and cold snakes grow slower).

Edit: as for reptiles and turtles in general, they definitely can solve some of the same puzzles mammals are tested on, but the results there are more recent. It turns out, being cold blooded, even their brains perform very slowly in cooler temperatures. When researchers warm up the room significantly, they get much better problem solving behaviors from reptiles.

Can you fucking imagine the process it takes to do this? So many art forms are additive; sculpting out of marble is subtractive. This means that once you make a line, you can't unmake it.

It is just baffling to me that human hands/minds are able to do shit like this. Absolutely breathtaking -- little room for error, but jesus christ, look at how that fabric hangs. Look at the little details. This was before the age of cameras -- he had no reference for a lot of it, I'm sure.

"I'm aware of that. But the topic that was mentioned (and that always shows up on Reddit from people who don't know better) is that physicians and ""big pharm"" are some evil Willy Wonka that hand out narcotics like hot cakes. As someone who requires a pain medication regimen, I imagine you know that no well-meaning physicians want their patients to rely on pain medication if it can be helped. So I argue with those people who bitch at physicians without knowing all the details and suggest ways like physical therapy, regular exercise or alternative methods that are forsaken for pain medication. But then there are individuals like you who obviously need pain medication on a regular basis and then my argument looks like I'm belittling people who have legitimate chronic pain. 

It's like defending physicians and their paradox when helping chronic pain patients automatically gets you blasted on this site. I've worked in medical settings where people regularly show up with quite obvious fake chronic pain as well as people who get discharged from the hospital/physical therapy and show up in the emergency department 2 days later because they fell getting out of bed due to the pain that should have been dealt with. It's frustrating debating with people who have 0 experience in this field and only know how to parrot people saying that there's an epidemic of painkiller prescriptions. It isn't false by any means but they think it's the physicians shoving Oxycodone scripts down people's throats, ignoring the fact that the only reason the physicians have to write those scripts is because patients decide that it's the only way to deal with their pain (which may be real or exaggerated).",pics,0
