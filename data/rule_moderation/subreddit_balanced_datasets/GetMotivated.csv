"The only Asian one that's good is mohism.

What the fuck does ordinary mean? The graphic has a family which is a little illuminating: Confucianism stresses filial piety (respect for ones family) but specifically it proposes (I think) 5 relationships in society that should be treated in a specific way. In short it's completely ridiculous to try to summarize Confucianism in a graphic like this. Confucianism has no thesis other than perhaps 

> society has a certain structure to it; respectfully adhere to this structure

And the legalism one is just plain wrong. It is a philosophy on human nature that was applied in government. It's premise is that humans are naturally amoral and self serving; they want goods but they avoid bads. So an effective government punishes crime heavily to incentivize its citizens to follow the law. Nowhere is there a notion of learning practical things; if legalism had a message on how to live life it'd be

> follow the law even if you don't want to because otherwise you'll eat shit

Also it's fucking preposterous to group those 3 schools of thought off as Asian. They are 3 major philosophical schools of thought that developed around the same time in China. Hilariously enough, Buddhism and daoism are MUCH better suited at explaining how one should live life. And there's myriad other Asian philosophies that are looked over here.

I'm sorry man but that is so ignorantly laughable that I can't help but LMAO at your insane level of ignorance. Look up man. Look at the thread title.

And that's cool. But here we are seeing OP post some BS that Ali is a human rights advocate for humanity. That's not true. The dude was a violent racist psychopath and that is what drove his career, it was his energy, his inspiration.

"Life & happiness is about viewing the world objectively. If you had a relatively stable upbringing, and don't suffer from a personality disorder yourself, this objectivity will likely come fairly naturally to you.

If you do have a personality disorder, you will find it difficult if not impossible to view life objectively. This is because personality disorders cause one have difficulty controlling their emotions, and how those emotions affect their perception of reality. In essence, they are unable to regulate their feelings creating their reality, which allows for the disregard of fact based (objective based) decision making and emotions. 

If you grew up in an unstable or abusive environment, you do have the ability to view the world objectively (and just accept it), but it is likely you will require some counselling and support to overcome the remnants of this abuse, or to remove yourself from the abusive situation, and view the world objectively.

"This is a follow up to this post, which was pretty well received: https://m.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/4xk3d1/text_10_years_ago_i_was_deeply_depressed_and/

I had requests for more detail on the specifics of how I turned my life around so this post will focus on the strategies and tactics I used. 

First I want to clarify, I'm not hiking the AT to help with depression or anything. I'm hiking because it's what I want to do. I'm hiking because I'm finally not held back by fears. I'm hiking because I'm finally LIVING after years and years of hiding in my room. I see this hike as a capstone on over a decade of self improvement.

Very briefly I'll recount my past(my other post has more detail). I grew up as an anxious and depressed Chinese kid. I was adopted from China at 8 and my father died when I was 13. This created a lot of problems that took me many many years to come to grips with. As a consequence I went through cyclical depression and anxiety for my teens and most of my twenties(im 29 now). I've had serious suicidal ideation and many points in life where I felt I couldn't possibly continue on. Despite it all I was able to push through and apply these practices that slowly, bit by bit, changed my inner being and as a consequence changed my outer world. 

Through the years I've had MANY relapses where it felt like everything I'd learned and gained was lost. But each time I fell I was able to come back a stronger, wiser, and with less fear.

Cornerstone Habits

Fitness changed my life. I was 100lbs going into highschool. Scrawny with zero confidence. I asked for a weight set for Christmas when I was 15 and started doing random lifts. Benching a whopping 25lbs. Curling 8lb dumbbells. But I stuck with it and by the age of 21 I'd built up to 189lbs and 8% body fat. Here's a old post I wrote up on /r/fitness talking about that transformation: https://m.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/18w30k/so_i_heard_rfitness_liked_asian_transformations/

Fitness gave me a sense of control over my life. It gave me confidence. It gave me the belief that I could accomplish anything that I set my mind to - a belief that was completely foreign to my younger self. Without this confidence I would never have taken any of my actions later in life because I wouldn't have believed myself capable of achieving any of those goals.

So I think it's vital to start the process of change with a cornerstone habit. It doesn't have to be fitness. But I think fitness makes a great one. You can measure your progress. It will make you feel better and improve your cognition. You'll receive external validation as you make progress and gain confidence and an improved self image.

I think meditation makes for another great cornerstone habit.

I recommend focusing on one simple habit and building your new life around it. Don't make it complicated. Start with a 15 minute walk everyday. Focus only on this habit. Then after a month build upon it. Add 25 push-ups to the end of your walk. Then a 5 minute meditation session. And so on. But not everything at once. Just build one simple habit that you don't skip no matter what. A simple habit that's not overly complicated or difficult to maintain. Changing a life starts as one simple change which will build unstoppable momentum given time 

The mind is everything

Truly our attitudes and perceptions are everything.

You see it on the trail all the time. Two people can be hiking the same trail and have completely different experiences. 

One is worried about what they'll do when they get home. They're worried about rain. Worried about the upcoming mountains.

The other is enjoying the sunshine. They're lookimg forward to cooking a warm dinner. They're happy that they get to spend a few months in nature.

Same trail. Same hike. Two totally different experiences. 

Because of their attitudes. Because of their perceptions. 

When I'm depressed I think of how unfair it was that I had to leave everyone I knew at the age of 8. How much easier life would be if I didn't grow up being so screwed up psychologically from my early childhood experiences. If I had a normal family. If I connected with my parents like most of my friends.

But I can't change the past. I can only change my attitude and reactions today. And it's when I take responsibility for my attitude that I can fight the darkness. I can look at my childhood as a curse or a gift. I KNOW I'm much stronger mentally and emotionally today because of my early life experiences. All my many periods of depression has forged an inner core of strength that others don't have. I'm much more resilient for the experiences.

So I can choose to wallow in self pity or I can choose to take advantage of the opportunity afforded to me and make the best of it. 

And that is powerful. We all have an incredible core of power within us. To claim it we need to have the courage to stop being a victim. To claim full responsibility over our life. To see our tribulations as a trial by fire. 

We are only victims of life if we allow ourselves to be victims. You can be great. It's there within you. Let go of the self-pitying narrative. It's only a story. Choose a new path. Choose the path of life. Choose to accept what happened in your past as a inevitable and necessary stepping stone to becoming the fully actualized and fully vibrant human being that you know you're meant to be.

And this change happens again with the smallest steps. It happens by choosing, on a daily basis, on an hourly basis, to change your attitudes and beliefs. Day after day. It's hard work. You've had years and decades of negative thoughts. They won't go away in a day or even a year. But they can and will be changed with perseverance.

Everything you need to know has been written about by someone else.

I started the path reading a Tony Robbins book. Now I think the guy is kinda cheesy and long winded but at the time his book helped a lot.

I don't have many specifics to recommend. Everyone is different. You will find your own authors who speak to you. But I firmly believe that once you set an intent to find the books and people that you need, that they will them materialize in your life almost as if by magic.

So open yourself to learning. Seek out authors. Seek out audio books. Open yourself to learning. Everything you're struggling with someone else has overcome and they've written books and given talks that will help you achieve similar outcomes.

Get a handle on your addictions.

Until you master your addictions you cannot master yourself. For me my big addictions were video games, porn, and caffeine. 

Mastering these was less a matter of actively trying to suppress them than a process of filling my life with more positive activities.

Here's a video I made talking about getting off caffeine: https://youtu.be/_kXq8na6Q9w

And my marker for positive/negative is simply what makes me fulfilled and happy at the end of the day. For me video games, porn, and stimulants gave me a temporary boost but always left me empty and depressed at the end of the day. And as I've removed the addictions with things like meditation, exercise, building my business, hiking the AT, socializing, being with my girlfriend i end the days happy and fulfilled. 

And it depends on how you're approaching a thing. When I used games as a tool to escape life they left me unfulfilled and unhappy. Now I play hearthstone a few hours a week, for fun, and it's great! Again it comes down to attitude and perspective.

So that's my simple yardstick. I get rid of that which leaves me empty and add that which makes me fulfilled.

Change in the end is actually very simple.

It really is. Focus on positive habits. Add to them. When you inevitably fall then start back small and build again.

Try new things. I try everything i come across. Crazy stuff. Astral projection. Lucid dreaming. Chakra crap. Most of it is BS and not useful but there are some really helpful nuggets that I never would have found if I hadn't tried. I've read a bunch of really useless self help books but most have had at least one tiny piece of useful info and thus weren't a waste of time.

Like Bruce Lee said, ""Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless and add what is specifically your own.""

In the end what gives me peace is that all we need to do is try. Given a long enough time horizon improvement always happens, if you try. 

So don't stress. Just try. Do what you can. If what you can means taking a shower and walking around your house - awesome! That's all it takes! Now do that again tomorrow. And soon you'll build unstoppable momentum. It truly is amazing.

Once you get into that lifestyle, although extremely hard to keep doing it as humans like to take easy road instead, it becomes your lifestyle instead of ""I'm trying to get to 120lb goal!"" Many people stop working out just b/c they seem to stagnate or gain weight - not knowing that's where you keep pushing it... anytime you lose weight and then start gaining weight means you're gaining muscle most likely (which is GREAT for your health, body, mind, soul, and looks good) + you're filling in the skin and tightening it from what your fat ass push out for the last 20 years.

1. My trip made me think about the countless people in my life that have helped make me the person I am today. I spend so much time trying to make everyone in my life happy, and many are not deserving of my time and they take me away from giving that time to those that matter. It made me reflect on and realize that I need to be more aware about the people in my life and freakin appreciate those that are important to me.


2. This one probably hit me the most and I realized how lucky I am. Lucky just to breath and have life on this incredible place. Lucky for all of the friends and family that have helped make me who I am. Lucky to have been raised in a positive, nurturing household, and all the values and beliefs I have received. Lucky for the education I have received, and the perspective this education and my life has given me. I could go on forever, but this trip made me more appreciative for my life than I've ever been. For those who are depressed or upset at their life, I encourage them to take some of the Magic fungi and go hangout near a creek for a while. Will do more for you than any therapist (or so I believe).


3.It's a waste to be constantly concerned with other's opinions. Trusting in yourself isn't easy but it's necessary. We can't spend our time constantly trying to make others happy before ourselves. Be selfish in the sense that you are the most important part of your life. We can't do anything if we don't believe in who we are and what we stand for. Believe in who you are, and trust in your intuition, I believe there is a part of us that tries to guide us to betterment. When we ignore that, we are ignoring ourselves. I had recently decided to not pursue grad school because my heart wasn't in it and a part of me was telling me to devote that time to something I am more passionate about. This experience certainly reaffirmed the decision I had made.


4. Choose where you spend your time and attention wisely. People spend so much time distracted by nonsense, whether it be politics, sports, television, etc ... what if they spent that time into bettering themselves and the world around them. Don't get me wrong distractions can be great, but don't let them define your life and what you think about.


5. Huge takeaway from this trip for me. I have had (and will continue to have) many things in my life that hold me back from fulfilling my full potential. I have lied to myself countless times saying these things are not bad (just like I am sure many people have) and I have to stop doing that. Being consciously aware of the things you shouldn't be doing will (hopefully) influence you to stop doing them. It'll be a tragedy if I let all the potential I have be held back by stupid bad habits, and I look forward to constantly reflecting and bettering myself.


6.Wow, holy shit, something I imagine shrooms do for a lot of people. I was in the most incredible freakin place for this trip, and this experience gave me the most appreciation for the world around me I have ever have. There is so much beauty in everything around us, and though we do a shitty job at doing it, it's our responsibility to take care of this paradise. What if every person had the goal to leave this place better than when they arrived . While it's easy to be pessimistic about how we as humans have ruined the world around us, this place is still magnificent. Get out, enjoy, connect with the world, and maybe try to influence someone else to do the same. (Also put a smiley face here because a Fucken frog sat in front of me and smiled at me for a good 15 minutes)


7. Our body's are incredible in all that they enable us to do, and it's our responsibility to respect them. I mean respect our bodies in every sense, brushing our teeth, putting the right nutrients this into our Body, staying active, etc. More importantly I have wrote this as a reminder to not become complacent. Once we start to go through the motions, and those motions don't consist of taking care of ourselves, we are doing ourselves a huge injustice. Be aware and stay aware of your everyday life and the small things you can do to stay energetic, to stay active, and to stay confident in who you are.


8.We won't ever be able to be happy or free if we are constantly scared or afraid of life around us. Take that risk to be better even if it has a possible negative consequence. Fly in that plane even if .001% of people die from flying in a plane. Go up to that girl and introduce yourself even if oh no she might not be into you. Relate this to number 5, I believe being constantly scared of things around us is the biggest detriment to many people's lives, and it undoubtedly holds them back. Be courageous, be tough, and go for whatever it is you want to go for!! Hoorah


9. So many of us spend our lives being prisoners to ourselves when we don't have to be. We should do everything we can to live the life we want even if it's a tough road or it seems impossible. What's worse than trying to live your life how you want and failing, is being trapped in a life you don't want. We have been blessed with the opportunity to live, so why do so many not take advantage of that. I encourage you to make the most out of your life, positively influence those around you, be passionate/engaged in whatever you do, and enjoy yourself along the way.

What do you prioritize if you are healthy and well off? Family? Work? Business? Art? What do you really want. Do you want to watch football all weekend and be a normal person or do you want to focus on bettering yourself? 

For me, im a writer so this comic hits home pretty hard. Everytime i want to go out, waste time on reddit, watch movies, workout, im sacrificing time i could be wriitng and making something out of myself. Every hour i have to work takes time away from this hobby. If i want to make a career out of writing i need to put in the hours. If i really wanted it, i would put it above everthing else that i can sacrifice. Right now, i only write about 5 hours a week. I waste a lot of time prioritizing in other areas of my life. 

I cannot give up work, time with my girlfriend or time with my family in friends. Its just not me. But i waste a lot of time on reddit haha so this comic speaks to me. And im not exactly well off.

"> to suggest that everything in your life is within your control is naive and also very condescending to people with real problems that are in fact outside their control

This is the truth. Claiming that there's no external factor that can influent your life is not only ignorant but also cruel. Is like telling the reason why millions of soldiers in the world war die because their will to live is not strong enough (!!!)

Heck, in my business class, they even taught that in order to help a business survive, the owner must be aware of BOTH the internal and external. For the external factors, you can only predict a part of it and hope that your business won't suffer much damage.

One more thing the comic totally missed is the *competitors*. You don't have to be in the situation of the athletes who never win the championship to understand it.

But I can tell you what debates are *not* for, and how so many (younger) people misinterpret them to be a screaming match between two people using ad hominem attacks and emotional reasoning. Either way, there's no legitimate use (that I can surmise) for name-calling and ad hominem attacks, other than for debators to win over ignorant audience members who legitimately believe that calling someone a 'bigot' or a 'xenophobe' is a valid argument.

lol, wow. Look at you, writing off someone's opinion solely on the basis of a label you gave them.

> I'm calling you a SJW. You're calling me someone who ""generalizes people and tries to write off others' opinions"".

Something you defined as the same thing.

> But that's not what I'm doing. 

Bar the fact that you just told me my opinion doesn't matter because of the label you gave me.

> Of course, in your mind as a SJW, it may look that way.

I like that you gave a good example immediately after.

> But believe it or not, people can choose to be attracted to whomever they want based on any and all physical characteristics that they deem attractive.

No one here denied that. I can see you are now deciding what my argument is for me.

> By your logic, that makes you shallow.

Really? I don't recall ever discussing what my tendencies when pursuing a relationship are. Please don't speak for me.

> And a hypocrite. 

Of what? You didn't exactly do much to think through this one, did you?

> Not me.

And here's the real heart of it. People want their worldview to be the ""right"" one. So they try to warp the commonly accepted ""right"" view of good morality to fit their view. They are so obsessed with being right that they are able to reject reality and start labeling anyone suggesting otherwise as whatever term they've created to ignore outside opinions.

People have always done this. You're no exception. Quite a few words people like to throw around. Stuff like SJW is just a new one for the anti-PC crowd to get behind.

----------------------

> I'm not arguing it in my defense. I'm simply stating that this particular topic does not make a person shallow

Definitions are definitions. Deal with it.

> Yes. That's exactly what you're doing. You're upset 

Says the person who made a post attacking me quite significantly. Are you sure that **I** am the one who is upset? 

> and now you feel better because you called someone shallow. Shallow, because they have different tastes than you.

Do I? I'm quite shallow myself, fyi. 

> Wrong. I can spot a SJW from a mile away, usually by the zeppelin-esque shadow they cast over me.

So, I'd love to hear this. Why am I a SJW? Other than the obvious reason of me disagree with you.

In more depth-- figure out when you are willing to forgive other people in your life... loved ones, friends, even strangers.  Step outside yourself and, as objectively as you can, decide whether you are being at least as kind to yourself as you are to others.  If not, ask yourself why, and see if that answer would hold water when applied to others.  Holding oneself to a high standard is noble, but if the end result is a crippling effect that leaves you unhappy and/or less effective, it's doing no one any good.

The majority of engineers that studied AE end up in systems or manufacturing engineering. Two areas that are extremely boring for most people.

Pretend that this happened to a friend. You saw them forego sports and partying and slog towards this and you know what they went through. You let them know that. Acknowledge it... That focus and effort means something, even if it isn't recognised by the scholarship committee, even if you have to set it aside for now. You congratulate them for that, ask them to set it aside and go to the first set of questions.

Why did they want the scholarship.... was it the financial assistance? Was it a matter of pride? A way to distinguish themselves? Do companies value it during interviews? Is it a prerequisite to something they wanted to achieve? Is there another way to achieve it? If they had gotten the scholarship, what obligations would they have? What would they have to give up? Reason through why your friend wanted the scholarship in the first place, and what the best alternatives are.

Did they want to distinguish themselves from their peers? What's another way to do it? Is it financial? What's an alternative? Loan? Part time job? Was it an opportunity? It's university... Opportunities exist with or without scholarships around every corner. Think about that specific alternative you would want them to pursue.... And how you would convince them to start on it.

Mentions of the ""Divine"" remaining capitalized as well as a few other marks lead me to believe the religious version existed first making this plagiarism... 

Still an intense and awesome poem. 

Edit: Earliest blog I found mentioning the poem and its (potentially) ""original"" form. 

When God wants to drill a man, and thrill a man, and skill a man;
when God wants to mold a man to play the noblest part,
when He yearns with all His heart to create so great and bold a man
that all the world might be amazed,
watch His methods, watch His ways.

How He ruthlessly perfects whom He royally elects.
How He hammers and hurts him and with mighty blows converts him,
into trial shapes of clay that only God understands,
while his tortured heart is crying and he lifts beseeching hands.

How He bends but never breaks, when His good He undertakes.
How He uses whom He chooses and with every purpose fuses
him with mighty acts induces him to try His splendor out.
God knows what He’s about.

When God wants to drill a man, and thrill a man, and skill a man,
watch His methods, watch His ways.

&gt;When I was 38 I contemplated beginning a two year Associates &gt;Degree in Radiography. I was talking to a friend and had &gt;almost talked myself out of doing it. I said ""I'm too old to start &gt;that. I'll be 40 when I get my degree."" My friend said ""If you &gt;don't do it, you'll still be 40, but without the degree."" I'm &gt;nearly 60 now, and that degree has been the difference &gt;between making a decent living, and struggling to get by.

Well, there is the point that pushing people can lead them to achieve more than they themselves thought possible, so sometimes this can actually work.  People end up spending enough effort to do what's mandated that they stop self-doubting and thus no longer guarantee that it can't be done as a self-fulfilling prophesy.

Yeah I preffered boxing. I can get punched. The kicking though? Fuck that

It was a Thai guy and I'm sure it was all stuff he learned in Thailand. I just thought it was inappropriate for our uses, or at least mine. I wanted to master being able to throw one or two good kicks at command, or 20 over the course of a minute or two, not 50 sloppy kicks.

See, I hated that.

* if we got rid of the government dependence and regulations, the Magic Market Fairy will solve all of today's problems.

I'm gonna Internet rant and sound really fucking bitter now.

This is some stupid shit most likely written by a woman.

Seriously.

You can tell.

Because most of these ""CARDINAL RULES""
are really all about avoid responsibility and moving on.

Make peace with your past.

No one is in charge of your happiness except you.

But...

TIME HEALS ALL?


That's a woman thought process
A process ingrained into women by society.

It's just a away of deflecting responsibility.


Taking RESPONSIBILITY, empathizing, trying to understand, admitting you are wrong, remorse.

THOSE things actually heal shit.
But ain't no damn rom com, or romance novel or reality tv show, talking about women taking responsibility for their actions and how they treat people.

Want to REALLY make peace with past and not fuck people and relationships up? Let go of your ego and pride and TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.
THATS REAL STRENGTH.

Not this stupid fucking ""cardinal rules"" bullshit that gives you more shit to tell yourself to help you avoid responsibility for your actions.

None of these fucking motivational pieces talk about taking responsibility, owning your bullshit, Setting your pride and ego aside.

It's all this fucking positive shit.
""Love yourself anyways""

Well I got fucking news for ya!

People generally don't actually LEARN that way!
Ya know, you don't steamroll over someone's life, a relationship, and say ""I shouldn't feel bad""
But every fucking guy knows that virtually every fucking woman is completely capable of doing so because stupid fucking ""cardinal rules"" like this are the fucking trend.

Nobody learns to be a better person by shrugging it off.
Women do this so easily because ""I'm a lady and deserve to be treated as such""

No. you deserve what you put out into the world.
If you put out lies, stupidity, and negative bullshit, that's what you're going to get back whether your a woman or a man.

"Make sure you're attributing responsibility appropriately.

For me, a lot of my anger at my past was really at myself but when I looked at it from a more rational viewpoint I realised that it wasn't really my fault and actually quite a lot of my anger would be more rationally directed at the people who were in my life at that time. So instead of ""how could I have failed at something so simple?"" I recognised that my difficulties stemmed from a) a lack of support from others; and b) explicit and unfair punishment/shaming from others over things that were definitely not my fault and completely outside of my control.

This allowed me to let go of the shame I felt about past ""failures"" by realising all that anger, which I had previously directed at myself, was really intended for the people who treated me unfairly. Of course, it would also make you unhappy if you were then to cling to *that* anger (at others) and therefore stay in the past once more, but I personally have found that that doesn't happen. Just relinquishing the shame has helped to set me free from feeling like the past has ""ruined"" things; I just don't feel the impulse to hold on to anger against others. I forgot about it pretty quickly the moment I stopped blaming myself.

Basically, the feeling that the past still affects the future, IME, is the feeling that *because there is something wrong with you* (as evidenced by the past), and you are a continuous feature of your life, there is no hope.

If you can reconcile the shame you feel, and make sure you're not taking on too much responsibility for things outside of your control, or expecting yourself to reach unattainable standards (for instance: ""I should never be upset"", or ""I should never make mistakes"" would be unrealistic), then you can feel a little more separated from your past.",GetMotivated,0

"I agree. My parents were from the baby boomer generation. They were basically raised to think 'get a degree = get a good job'. And that was true in their day.  They basically told me the same thing, I remember my mom telling me 'it doesn't matter what degree you get, just get a degree.' And it's certainly better than not having one. Checks off a box in the requirements section for many jobs. But doesn't bring the skills required today (I studied anthropology BTW).
