"So as a former Bernie supporter who's in the tank for Hillary in November, let me ask you Bernie-or-bust people a question.

Much of Bernie's continuing influence, and much of his ability to push his agenda, is going to depend on his influence in the Democrat Party as a result of his surprising level of success in this primary campaign.  If Donald Trump becomes elected President--and on his coattails, the GOP will likely solidify their control of Congress--a great deal of his influence goes away.

Instead of someone becoming President (whether she's corrupt or not) who at least ostensibly agrees with many of your positions, and has some impetus to listen to them, you'll have somebody as President who is diametrically opposed to almost all of what you want, and a Congress who likewise hates your agenda.  And worse, they won't need you, and will have absolutely no reason to listen to you.

So my question is, why are you OK with this?  Shouldn't you continue to push Bernie's revolution any way you can?  Isn't eliminating your influence over the Democrat party by going third party, or worse, voting Trump, simply going to be worse for accomplishing Bernie's aims?",SandersForPresident,1

Likewise there has been no actual evidence of ""corruption"" - only insinuations that accepting campaign contributions  = corruption.

">So.. opening a motion at 9:30am, when the convention starts at 10am is clean?

The convention began at 9, doors were open until 10. The delegate vote didn't happen until after 10. I don't see the problem. 

>Pretending the 'ayes' are louder than 'nays' is clean?

>At minimum if unsure about 'ayes' vs 'nays', do a headcount, but no, it's not open for debate, it's permanent, is that clean?

Whether you agree or not, the chairperson has the final say. They were also at the head of the room and we know that because all of our delegates never showed up, that we were in the minority. The outcome wouldn't be any different. Obviously they heard the difference or they wouldn't have made the call. The reason we have a leader is so that decisions are made rather than every standing around arguing back and forth. 

>Denying those 64 (and eventually down to 58) barred delegates any chance to show/prove themselves is clean?

The committee that vetted the delegates had Bernie supporters on it. There wasn't anything shady about it. The 64 people didn't have their credentials in order and were told about it in advance. People were flagged on Clinton's side too. Out of the 64 on our side, only 8 showed up with 6 being seated. The other 58 just didn't show up like the 400 other people that didn't show up. If they had then we would have won. 


>With motion still open on floor, taking in only vote of 'ayes', before smashing the gavel and escaping, not even taking in 'nays' at the end of the convention is clean?

A 2/3 majority was necessary for any rule changes. There weren't. We had people yelling, screaming, and booing of course she left once the proceedings were over.
