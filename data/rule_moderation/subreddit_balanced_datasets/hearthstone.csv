"It's you who needs to understand probabilities.

Let's say you have a normal six sided die and roll it 10 times.

There's a small chance that you roll six ten times.
The chance is *exactly the same* (that is, incredibly small) as the chance that you roll *exactly* 1,4,5,6,1,4,3,6,5,2, in this order.  
And the chance to roll 6,4,3,2,6,5,6,1,2,3 is also the same.  

But because people are trained to find patters everywhere, rolling a six ten times seems somehow more significant to us. Randomness doesn't care. Every outcome is equally possible to it. You just happened to witness an outcome which happens to look weird to us humans.",hearthstone,1

Quality nitpicking? It's a huge point you moron. A zoo deck relies on tempo and board control. If they have to spend that many bodies or buffs just to remove one taunt it weakens there position considerably. Any minion or buff spent on Soggoth is free health for the Warrior. And the fact that they'll spend a whole turn trying to remove it means the warrior gets another turn to play one of their superior late game threats which the depleted zoo player will now need to deal with on their turn. It can be a game changer tbh. But I guess you think they are getting good value blowing all those resources on a single taunt minion... ,hearthstone,1

Fair matchmaking shouldn't be an expectation once most average players are knocked out of a run. If you're consistently only getting 3 or 4 wins per run, there shouldn't ever be a chance you're matched against someone who regularly farms arena runs for packs or gold.

"This Twat like all the other idiots at that competition, was a popularity  contest based on how many tickets or how many muppets supported him. Game play has absolutely nothing to do with a game that a computer formulates in advance how any deck formulation is played out.  Then it controls that formulation even more in game by providing more Iwin cards from a not so random choice that had already more or less pre selected its champions prior to that match up, as any cards played illogically target whatever the not so random computer decides. Everybody must think that Twat had real skills at choosing a deck, because that was all he did. His gameplay was generic to that pre selected approach there was no skill in it, he literally couldn't play anything else. I suppose this community of idiots jerking each other off while eating each others dookies thought he is ace, no just another absurdly pretentious twat, having been gifted a carrot to suck as it get all this forums of dookie craving jerksters, spending even more at play this rigged game. He has no skill no none whatsoever when the computer decided his approach away from any probability and mathematical odds, because it chucked him more or less nothing to win with when it was formulated prior on how that match would be played out. I actually pity the fools on this topic thinking there as anything else in this game, buying into game where the commentators are as equally stupid commentating that hey guys would you look at how the computer has granted him his choice of cards, will he win, oh no the computer has pre selected the opponents counter OMG OMG it's really heating up now when the cards are dropping on how that computer preprogrammed their approach. The user has simply generically dropped them according to how they set out their deck, using no skill in how they logically played out their turn, can feel the tension, OMG OMG its game over, the computer has chosen its winner. And statistically it was based on a popularity contest because that will promote more investment when more people are following this person and more tickets were sold for their match.

We could almost pity this load of complete and utter retards. We could argue about any other game because they have skill this game, starcraft overwatch etc etc. This game absolutely doesn't after choosing a deck, it is generic on how it will be played out because that computer has rigged its results and game play.",hearthstone,1

If he succeeds, he'll be a genius who found a way to make a big tournament without being at the mercy of the sponsors... He wouldn't be the first seeing that other companies have already done similar stuff, but he would be the first significant effort in Hearthstone. 

However now that he's not gaining the traction he hoped he was wrong to try because he's changing things to a tournament format he technically owns?

"Thanks to mother sunlight for the miracle she did for me. +27810950180 My husband has been cheating on our marriage yet I though he was been deceived by his mom. Unknown to me that he has been a womaniser. When I contact sunlight, the goddess told me about this I doubted. Then she asked me where is he? I told her, he's about to be going to a meeting that was 9months ago. Because he told me meeting because of sunlight words I tried to ask him the kinda meeting he was going but he never tell me nothing. Then goddess sunlight told me what to do to find out the truth. After he left, with his car that night, I also took my car then I followed him he didn't know because he never thought I could do something crazy like that. When he get to the hotel he packed the car and went inside. I have a spear key for his car so also he has mine that night, I also, drove in then I packed my car in the hotel and drive his car home. The next morning he came and I asked him. Honey where is your car? then he told me was attacked and was serious beaten by arm robbers I looked at him with tears he thought I felt sorry for the story he just told me then, he kissed me and said at least I still live it's okay. Then I deep my hands in my pocket and brought out his the spear key and I took him to the back of the house where I packed his car. When he saw the car he was confuse then I called my younger sister to drive me car home from the hotel. When she drove in with my car he was so surprised that the car he saw last night was mine. Just as the goddess said. I did everything and it was more like a dream. I never really believe that my husband has been cheating, all I thought about was, maybe it's the mom deceiving him. That morning I angrily went into my room and mailed mother sunlight everything that happened she laughed. Then I ask how I can forgive him because I don't feel like and because of my children if I just tell him that, he is forgiven he might play another drama on me. Then goddess sunlight now cast a spell and told me some spiritual words to say and told me somethings I need to do. She told me not to look at the mirror once I am done. I should just go and meet my husband. Then did everything she instructed me to do. Once I he sees me, he was moved by the beauty he sees in me then he knee down and said, you are so beautiful. normally my husband has never told me that ever since I gave birth but today the powers and the charms of sunlight that has cleaned him he swore never to live me alone again. He was fully charmed. And he was changed to my satisfaction. Then Right in my eyes I fall inlove with mother sunlight because of her powers and truthfulness. I've never see someone like her in my whole entire life. She is compassionate, kind, merciful and she is so caring and loving. Pls join me brethren in praise.

"I used to browse reddit but I made a post just to comment on this.

The reason aggro decks attract such utter disdain and hatred from streamers is because the streamers are skilled players. 
Aggro decks have 0,zeroooooooooooooooooooooooooo skill requirement. draw well and smorc.
i never ran combo decks but they are very skill intensive because of the aggro cancer..if you survive and draw your pieces,you win. Now drawing is not the challenge...what is the challenge? surving. why? SMORC!

I am not mad at people using it to climb ladder. but it is people like you who try defend it to sound like it is a feat.

""reading potential pressure (from the aggro side) and potential clears or pending high-value trades (from the control side, if applicable)""

are you kidding me???????
It is only tense from the receiving end and you need to MAKE PLAYS. aggro player does not need to MAKE PLAYS, YOU SMORC.
Board clears do not come into the picture as aggro decks win by turn 5-6., board clears come into play after that and if aggro doesnt win by turn 8 or so,they are done for.

""Aggro decks have not always been strong enough to compete""
Face Hunter,Aggro Shaman,Midrange Shaman.
sounds familiar,bro?

> Play around a third Fireball, get fucked by Counterspell or Spellbender.
If a Mage plays a secret from conjurer you have at least a chance to figure it out. You have a 12/12 on board, Mage is at 10HP. All it plays is a Secret. Chances are: 1. Bluff, 2. Vaporize, 3. Ice Barrier, 4. Ice Block. From there you can branch out into different lines of play to try and figure it out.

What I'm saying is that often times, players will start behaving a certain way if they picked a card valuable (ping a 5 health to prepare for a flamestrike, burst you down ignoring your minions if they have lethal with a fireball) etc. Again, I'm not saying it's infalible or that you will *always* predict it, but that you *could* do it with enough info.

"Remember when Naxx launched and it could take [up to something like 5 minutes](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/710060-hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/69701944) for [every action to process](http://www.hearthpwn.com/forums/hearthstone-general/general-discussion/21517-why-is-there-so-much-lag-today)?  Or when GvG launched and only a few people were actually able to [log in at a time and were frequently kicked out](http://www.hearthpwn.com/forums/hearthstone-general/general-discussion/24647-so-im-still-unable-to-log-in-to-battle-net) while trying to buy packs?  Or how EU players frequent complaints that the [servers are down](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/search?q=eu+down&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all), to the point where blizzard pushed back the start time for Tavern Brawls in EU to keep the servers up.

It's funny that you mention reno specifically, as the reason Reno didn't have the active glow at first was because [they didn't have an efficient way to do it](https://twitter.com/bdbrode/status/665688652199034880).  They apparently came up with a solution since it works now but it wasn't always that way.


Multiplayer games don't update every millisecond and aren't performing as many calculations as you think.  Looking at Planetside 2, [world record holder for most players online in a single fps match](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/1/planetside-2-gamers-aiming-for-fps-battle-world-record-this-weekend-370414), with 1158 players in a single battle.  After some digging it seems that the actual population cap is around 6000.  Planetside 2 also updates 5 times per second, or once every 200 milliseconds.  Hearthstone has 30,000,000 players last I checked, and if only 1/5th are actively playing (the same ratio as when the FPS world record was set) then that's still a 1,000 times more players.  That's a lot of additional room for a more complex game, especially since programmers ""cheat"" by skipping frames when calculations start taking too long.


As for Hearthstone, the game has 968 collectible cards, plus tokens, with some cards having multiple animations (summoning another minion, entrance, choose-one, etc...) and we easily have a good 1200-1300 animations.  (And this isn't even including boss only cards, but there isn't a timer during adventures to we can ignore them.)  With a cheap comparison algorithm (using animation IDs instead of names, optimized table, hash mapping) let's say that checking each item on the table takes 2 processor cycles (1 to get the value in the table and a second to compare it, this is generous)  Taking the Hearthstone 30 million total players, even if only 1 million people are playing at once (1/30th, less than the 1/5th ratio we used above.), each card played could take 742ms to find the correct animation time. (A 3.5GHz processor takes ~.2857 nanoseconds per instruction, 1200~1300 items in the table each taking 2 instructions is .742 microseconds per card played, and 1,000,000 players)

What I just calculated would **ONLY** be the lookup time on the table, which would be on top of processing the game, running AI, and regular network latency (80 milliseconds).  While it probably won't crash the servers, it could significantly impact the responsiveness and smoothness of playing the game.  [Here is a video demonstrating just a 300ms delay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjUpiwvIa5A), it's just enough input lag to be irritating.

Again though, all of this is moot since there could just be a flat animation time for every animation and it would likely even out over the course of the game, and be infinitely cheaper in terms of processing power *AND* development time/overhead.",hearthstone,1

Because of HS lacks absolutely all complexity compared to Duelyst or MTG it attracts the biggest playerbase of inbred braindamaged 5 year olds. Team 5 also doesn't help by refusing to improve their game and releasing lazy and unimaginative design like Carrion Grub or Flamewreathed Faceless which are honestly just sad cards. They refuse to take advantage of their card game and make actually good stuff which requirest thinking, but even if they did it wouldn't see play because in HS the agressor is always in a better position and Taunt is just a bad mechanic, a pale shadow compared to Block.

See thread.

""Of course, some cards should be bad, especially basic cards with simple effects like Taunt who get better variants (Pompous Thespian). Start with a few weak cards to learn about value and replace them with better ones as you get gold. There's also the odd bad card like Majordomo Executus that sees play because it defines a unique and fun kind of deck. And I'm sure many will keep playing Yogg for the fun of it, even though he got significantly nerfed.""

"&gt;Except you don't when the best thing you can do with this lead is play a 3 drop and the worst case is a totem the following turn. 

You don't have a strong lead by having a 7/7 and other minions on the board by turn 5 while your opponent has nothing? The list I am running almost guarantees that you will have board control by turn 4 allowing you to get out of control but I'll get on to that later.

&gt;Doing 7 damage to the opponents face doesn't matter in the long run if you just get wiped off the board in the next turn when your 7/7 and totem gets removed.

Doing 7 damage to face is actually huge. That a little less than 1/4 your opponents health. Also what is just outright clearing a 7/7 and other minions on turn 4/5?

&gt;And what if they had some minions on the board already (like ya do) and just clear up your totem/Tuskarr (since that's your best option)?

You are almost guaranteed to have board control by turn 4 with things like Spirit Claws, Tunnel Trogg, Totem Golem, Flame Juggler, etc.


&gt;If your Flamewreathed gets Hexxed/Executed/Fireballed you get so far behind you pretty much lose the game. There's a reason why myself and so many other Shaman players cut it from our decks because as it was previous said, it's a liability more often than not.

Having your 4 drop have removal spent on it saves your actual lategame from getting removed. Even when it gets taken out it is still good.

http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/643721-mid

This is the list I have been running. I may end up cutting one of the Tuskars for an Unbound or a Thunderbluff if the nerf to them really is that big but the free totems help with the TFBs and spell damage totem is always nice. You're almost guaranteed to have board control by turn 4 allowing you to play the 7/7 uncontested and then proceed to roll out of control from there.",hearthstone,0
"I'm assuming that if you get the ""Oh no! We can’t enable Twitch Prime on your account.""message and if you done Step 4 properly, it is because your Amazon Prime has not been activated?

"A liability? How? Worst case scenario you play this on turn 3 (with coin) or 4 and it eats removal that would have gone toward your actual lategame. A solid 7/7 on turn 4 to follow up the mess of minions you spew out beforehand is gamewinning.

If an average control warrior game takes 15 minutes, you need 45 hours of playtime to reach it. But if an average mid range shaman game takes 10 minutes, you need 33 hours to reach legend.

"ANOTHER PSA: Problem with verifying? If you use pre-paid credit card like me and it's empty, transfer some money to it. Amazon verifies your card by temporarily charging some amount of money from your account.

It worked instantly for me and did NOT charge a single dime from my account, so it's safe.",hearthstone,0

"Although balance does include buffs, I really don't think it makes sense to do so in 90% of the cases of imbalance in the game.  The game is waaaay faster than it used to be, and buffing cards so that they could be played as the game exists today would be a case of power creep.  It's going to be much better for the game if they just slow down the vast majority of cards that are printed in the future.

Also, it's clear you haven't put much thought in this since you're calling comparison to balance changes within a week of release of something.  There's essentially no situation in which a card will be printed and should be changed within a week of its release.  Period.  That's absolutely ridiculous.",hearthstone,0

I'm not *apologizing* for it; I didn't write it. I'm saying it'd require a great deal of work to fix. It's a problem I've actually thought about for a long time as I've learned and worked with the Hearthstone protocol itself, and it's honestly not an easy fix. Network code is sensitive. Something as core as how the game's entities are laid out at the protocol level and described to the engine is super sensitive.

If it's expensive and doesn't synergy with Auctioneer then we can just play it without Auctioneer, if the card is strong enough to justify its own deck, like Oil.",hearthstone,0

Control Warrior wins vs Freeze Mage 82% of the time  

So yeah, CW vs Freeze Mage is more lopsided than CW vs Midrange Hunter, but the difference is smaller than many people think. Mid-range hunter vs CW is not a soft counter, it's a hard counter.

Well,I enjoy playng priest.My first deck when WOTG came was a cheap C'thun priest that I still have to this day and play with it.I am not a good player(rank 13-15 each month) but I have a lot of fun with my cheap decks as a F2P player.Heck,I don't even own COTW or most crazy shaman cards.Tyrande looks like quite good to me and I would really enjoy her as my main priest hero.It would make me feel really special!

"&gt; The thing is, your version of what happens is a possible explanation that is currently consistent with how Yogg operates, it isn't founded in any previously existing rule in HS.

Yes, they most likely had to hack together some rules/code for Yogg specifically.  
  
&gt; There is no such thing as summoning a spell in this game, but I assume you mean cast because that is the language you use later on  
  
I used that language to differentiate Yogg ""casting"" a spell from a Hero actually casting a spell. Ownership of spells wasn't a concept that had to exist before it became a question with Yogg/Servant of Yogg. Ownership of spells may not be a game mechanic per se, but it does work as a description of how Yogg operates - and explains why his spells wouldn't trigger on cast effects while still seeming to be cast by you (Drawing, Discarding, etc).  
  
&gt; YOU cast the spells but they don't count as ""spells cast"" because Blizz decided that would be too crazy.  
  
This is a possible explanation as well.",hearthstone,0
