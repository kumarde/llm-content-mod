"I used to masturbate onto birds at a local park. Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven't done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me.",LifeProTips,1

"Why is she alone at 101?  That's sad.  If she was a bitch to people in her youth I feel no more sadness though.  I am looking forward to a few people in my family being alone and getting yelled and ignored when they get older.  I've even considered pretending I forgive my mom and have her come live with me so I can commit the same level of abuse on her in her old age that she inflicted upon me growing up.  

I was initially mad at your comment, but then I remembered I have an aunt who went blind in her 60's.  She rolled her eyes when I asked for help with mom abusing me, and she knew about  many of the abuses going on and chose ignoring it as the better option.  Even defended her when I found out mom was stealing my credit!!  So I left her a really nasty voice mail gloating when I heard the news, ""Ha bitch, you ain't rolling your eyes no more, huh!""  Holy balls did that feel good because FUCK HER.

"Some things, especially political stuff, are too controversial for people to feel confident/safe speaking out publicly against.

There are still ways for their ""voice"" to be heard, even if not broadcasting to the world how they feel. They can vote. They can boycott. They can divest. And in terms of social relationships, they can even ignore and distance themselves from others.

Using the example of Trump because it's current and relatable, but this principle transcends a lot of this: it deals with friends, professional relationships, social circles, and obviously politics. It doesn't have to just be politics, it can be anything that is difficult to talk about:

It was the perceived widespread expectation that Trump would lose the election, and by a lot. It wasn't even a contest. Then Trump won. He won by a landslide according to the electoral college at least. People did speak up, by voting.

At that point, you would think the liberal mainstream would get some perspective and understand that their thoughts were not as popular as they thought. Nope. They protested, convinced that the election was rigged. They continue to protest, convinced that they are the majority view.

Meanwhile, although they unequivocally have the loudest voice, they are still not the majority. Except for a few, the media was projecting a stock market dip if Trump won the election. Nope. Investors spoke up by buying into the market and driving prices skyward - expressing their confidence in Trump. Again, the loudest voice was not the majority. The market is still high as I write this, meaning that the confidence in Trump from institutional & individual investors and businesses has not wavered - despite the media projecting a sense of widespread hatred for his administration.

"Left sources outnumber right sources considerably. 

Right sources are basically Fox News, Drudge Report, and Breitbart, although no one listens to Breitbart.  They do have a monopoly on talk radio, but it's the same crowd that already goes to their websites.  WSJ is right leaning, but the bulk of the people who read that are there for the financial news, not the political ones (granted, much of it is intertwined).


Left sources, on the other hand are ALL of the broadcast news outlets, plus all of the non-Fox cable outlets.  CNN can be argued to be moderately left, but that's just recent that they took a turn to the right.  Let's face it, they're not nicknamed the ""Clinton / Communist News Network"" because of their fair reporting.   

The kicker for the left is also the rest of Hollywood.  All the award shows - left commentary.  All of the sitcoms have comments about typical left policies.  This is also the case for tv talk shows that when they delve into commentary, it's left leaning, such as Ellen, The View, Oprah, etc. ",LifeProTips,1

Similarly for lunches, I make a chicken tortilla soup that will last almost two weeks and freeze the portions after cooking.

"Most important tip: Proofread. Proofreading is the dirty dishes of admin. It's never done and yet you must keep up with it. Particularly with numbers. It will feel like you don't have time for this but really, you must. You can even proofread as you work, to save a bit of time.  Second tip: use your calendar to schedule appointments for tasks that will trigger a reminder until you've got the routine pinned. Third: After printing something, don't ever bring it straight to your boss. That's right: proofread it again. Sometimes what is right on the screen is wrong on paper. The truth is though that high accuracy takes time. It just doesn't happen over night so don't be too hard on yourself. Usually a new job takes a month or two to feel familiar with, I find. Just pay attention, ask yourself your reminder questions every day (did i do xxx?) employ your calendar, and PROOFREAD (did i mention proofread?) Good luck - and don't beat yourself up!

"If you ""realized you didn't need it anymore,"" you actually solved the underlying problems that led you to smoke in the first place. Which is better than having to come up with what basically boil down to bandaids that will keep you from smoking.

I actually don't advocate ""stepping down"" except in cases where withdrawal would be scary - alcohol, opiates, and gambling are three terrifying withdrawal addictions and you will suffer from quitting cold turkey rather than controlling your intake down to 0. Alcohol and heroin can kill you if you go into withdrawal too severely.

However you can't just quit cold turkey, you have to either have the original problem under control or find solutions that will ""stop the bleeding"" and treat the symptoms of the problem you describe. If your problem is that you are overstressed and thus you smoke, you need to find other outlets for that stress rather than smoking (which is more difficult in terms of stopping smoking than simply leaving the stressful situation).",LifeProTips,0

Also, the thing to bear in mind is that most of the uncertainties in life are going to arise from issues that don't really impact our day to day existence. Is climate change real? Is Hillary Clinton the devil? Is Russia the most serious threat to U.S. global power? Does gay marriage destroy the fabric of morality? Is gender a choice or a physiological fact? Does Trump have an IQ over 100? Are GMO's bad for us?

Now ask yourself, do any of those things really matter to you when you hear your alarm clock go off in the morning? When you stumble into the shower? When you have that first cup of coffee in the morning? When you're stuck in traffic? When you make love to your partner? When you're taking a crap? When you're having a family barbecue? When you're dying of cancer?

You want an LPT on what to trust? Okay, here it is: trust yourself, and trust the people you surround yourself with. That's really all that's going to matter at the end of the day.

Opinions and perspectives about things that don't directly impact your day to day existence do not matter. Not really. They are food for conversation and fuel for imagination at best. It's the stuff of leisure. Life is best lived with a narrow focus. At least for most of us. Broaden your gaze too much and the world starts to look pretty bleak and grim. Love your family. Love your friends. Try to be a good person. Have faith in yourself. Trust your judgment. Anything beyond that is mental masturbation.",LifeProTips,0

"Two reasons, but first I want to clarify, primary care and emergency care are very different, distinct fields of practice, and just because they did a rotation in primary care does not mean they'll be all that knowledgeable during an emergency. 

Reason one, they probably have no idea what I have available equipment/medication wise, and may make suggestions that are irrelevant because of a lack of proper equipment or meds, but it's also a distinct possibility that even if they had at one point been trained in the exact right thing to do, they received that training 5, 10, or more years ago. 

The other relevant concern, assuming an ideal scenario where the physician is an ER doc and knows exactly what to do, is once that physician takes over patient care, if they do something outside my scope of practice in the field, they need to physically hop in the ambulance and explain to the receiving doctor what they did (otherwise it'd appear as though I was operating outside my scope, or worst case if they did something wrong, I'd be responsible if they didn't tag along). 

Trained and untrained bystanders can be very helpful on emergency scenes, but they need to be willing and able to take directions from the official responders on scene, or it'll quickly devolve in to chaos. ",LifeProTips,0

"This is specific to issues related to research, but I regularly use scholar.google.com to find health information and the like because what's in the media is so contradictory and misleading.  In fact, abstracts to research papers are often easier to read than lengthy news stories anyway, and in some cases you can get the full article and read more in depth if you want.  

For example, one thing I used this for recently was to figure out how to get rid of mice - many news stories talk about how mint can repel mice and/or how mint actually does nothing to get rid of mice.  Reading research articles however, it seems capsaicin, rather than mint, has been studied as a mouse deterrent and there's some evidence it works. Haven't tried it myself yet, but it provides at least some useful info.

You can also use it to look up legal decisions - having a bit of a legal background I've often seen the media do some pretty atrocious/clueless reporting on cases.  Many times information is taken directly from one side's lawyer and therefore is completely biased and misleading.  Unfortunately decisions can be a bit hard to read because the format the legal world has decided on for decisions is pretty useless for quickly getting a summary of the decision and what the case involves.

On the night before our wedding my ex texted me, basically wanting to reconnect.  I just let her know I wasn't interested and that was that. Without the filter of hormones and loneliness, she just seemed pitiful and I think I dodged a huge bullet.",LifeProTips,0

"Excellent advice, there are a few heuristics you can add to that:

-anything nutrition/supplements related is most likely bogus. The truth is that we don't know much about nutrition because it's extremely difficult/impossible to make controlled studies 

-""hot"" issues are always overblown. Right now, terrorism is trendy. Fear sells. 

-learn about biases, they are incredibly common and hard to detect even once you're aware. Regression to the mean, law of small numbers, ""if a is true, then b is true. If b is true, then c is true. We know a to be true, thus c is true."" 

I found these books to be incredibly helpful at learning about how we think, and how easily our brains can be manipulated/tricked: ""thinking fast and slow by Daniel kahneman""  and ""bad science by Ben goldacre"" ",LifeProTips,0

"If have problems forgetting your stuff, it's because you don't routinely check for it...  So what you are saying is that  if you can't remember to take your stuff with you because you have a hard time making a routine to check for it, make a routine to check for it. What?",LifeProTips,0

"Lived in Florida all my life. Best bet is to evacuate if you're not sure. Go visit family or friends during the hurricane and take valuables with you just in case. If you absolutely must stay, stock up on clean water and non-perishable food. Get a radio and portable battery in case the power goes out. Doubt you have the money for a generator, but those are neat too. Board up windows. If you can, go be with others as it sucks to deal with it all alone.",LifeProTips,0

"In which case you could try food banks. In my city there's one central group that does most of the processing and distribution to the streets side locations(meaning you only meet fellow volunteers who aren't homeless or at least noticeably so). There's usually one or two desk jobs, but warehouse workers only do as much ""heavy"" lifting (ie a bag of potatoes or a box of cans). There's lots of work there and always open positions in virtually every department.",LifeProTips,0

Kinda late to the party but I work as a trail builder in the Hudson Valley)(paid volunteer). We are always looking for volunteers to come out and help build/repair their favorite trails. It's a very thankful job and every person has a new appreciation for the trails they frequent after finding out how much goes into making trail. It really is a feel good activity and you help your parks out big time! Nynjtc.org if you're interested ,LifeProTips,0
