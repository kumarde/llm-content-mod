In a November 22nd, 1944 letter to U.S State Department officials, regarding visits to these alleged ""death-camps"", the Red Cross said; ""(We) had not been able to discover any trace of installations for exterminating civilian prisoners...""

>Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It? by Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman (2002).

Lol... Michael Shermer, the guy who back-stabbed David Cole (a JEWISH revisionist) on the Phil Donahue show back in the 90's. He had conceded to Cole, prior to the show. Admitting, that neither himself, the Auschwitz museum, nor his many intellectual buddies could provide a rational response to David Cole's ""38 Questions"". Yet, Shermer cucked after supposedly getting scolded by Phil Donahue himself over it (this was Shermer's first time on television, I believe) Shermer would later call David Cole to apologize and again agree that he was correct... David Cole recorded that conversation. I'd share the videos with you, but I'm sure you've seen them, ""EVIDENCE-DENIER!!!"" Lol 

He was on Montel Williams in the 90's too. Then the Jewish Defamation League put a $25,000 purse on his head, of which I believe they were exposed for, leading him to go into hiding and change his name. He would later be exposed and have his life RUINED a SECOND time... for asking questions. Hmmmmm

>Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory by Deborah Lipstadt (1994).
>History on Trial: My Day in Court with David Irving. by Deborah Lipstadt (2005).

Deborah Lipstadt does nothing more than witch-hunt for ""anti-Semites"" and advocate to throw them in prison on shit premises. Disgusting... As Martin said, ""When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you're only telling the world that you fear what he might say."" 

Also, could she possibly be a little bias, as a Jew, who seeks to lock up anyone who questions a Jew???

David Irving, regarded as the most renowned historian on the subject, sued Deborah Lipstadt for libel after she tried branding him a ""Holocaust-denier"" in her continuing witch-hunts. This term is simply a communist-inspired silencing-tactic, much like ""anti-Semite"", ""racist"", ""bigot"" and others are.

Lol (How to politely call someone a racist, in response... Silencing-tactic.)

""In In Hitler's Shadow, Evans strongly criticized Nolte for statements which implied that perhaps there was something to Holocaust denial.[11] In addition, Evans took Nolte to task for his claim that the victors write history, and that the only reason why Nazi Germany is seen as evil is because Germany lost the war rather than because of the Holocaust.[12] In addition, Evans attacked Nolte for claiming that a letter written to Neville Chamberlain from Chaim Weizmann on 3 September 1939 promising that the Jewish Agency would support the war effort was a ""Jewish declaration of war"" on Germany that justified ""interning"" all Jews in concentration camps as an attempt to justify the Holocaust.[13] Writing from a functionalist perspective, Evans took Hillgruber and Hildebrand to task in In Hitler's Shadow for their intentionalist theories about the Holocaust.[14]""

"Very well written and very well said.  While we - historians and non-historians alike - may wish to look back at a nineteenth century conflict through a twenty-first century prism and reduce the actors' motives down to a single narrative, such a deterministic approach fails to recognize the humanity of the individuals involved.  In truth, what induced the Southerner to the Colors is so deeply complex that it would be unjust to paint the ""principles behind the cause"" with a single narrative's brush.


Instead, I suggest examining the question not from the macro to the micro - ""the Confederacy fought for X, so the States seceded because of X, the individual must believe X"" - but from the other way around.  Put more succinctly, from the perspective of the individual (man or woman, solider or not) and their motivations for supporting the cause, how those individuals' motives influenced their states, and finally how those states created the identity of the Confederacy.  


This is, of course, still an oversimplification of the interplay of the myriad of factors that brought about and sustained the conflict.  However, I do think it's helpful to illustrate the futility of the deterministic narrative and thereby suggest that an examination of motive is best made at the level of the individuals involved.  Upon such examination, I think it will be clear that no single reason is pervasive; instead, that the motivation to fight came from many and varied sources as the conflict began and as it progressed.

As you have so well put, there are several overall themes that can be pointed to as sources of motivation for war - societal (slavery and the stratified class structure), economic (planter/yeoman vs. industrialist), political (expansion of slavery), etc.  Though these themes are well supported, they are created by historians looking through a prism and essentially categorizing their observations.  I suggest that the Southerner's rational is even a step further complex - that the participants were not only induced by their own individual reason or reasons but that those motives were fluid and changing over time.  


Take, for example, a volunteer making his way to Richmond in the spring of 1861.  Sure, he may be aware of some of the geopolitical concerns at play, but is that why he's enlisting?  It could be, but more likely it's because war is some grand adventure and all the local boys joined his town's unit.  Now contrast him with a draftee in the winter of 1864.  He almost certainly holds some notion of a need to preserve the Southern system and possesses some vague hatred of Those People, but that's not why he's fighting. He's fighting because he has to.  Now what if this recruit and this draftee find themselves in the same trench outside of Petersburg in the winter of 1865?  There is no pretense for why they're there - they're there because the invaders are there.  What motivates them then? If their lines break, there is noting to stop the Army of the Potomac from marching to their hometown.  If they fight they'll likely freeze, starve,  or catch a Federal ball.  If they desert they'll likely freeze, starve, or catch a provost's ball.  Many such men stayed at their posts throughout the war, many deserted, and some who deserted even found their way back to arms.  But the reasoning behind each such decision and action of such soldiers - though potentially influenced by pressures from society, family, and duty - were uniquely his own.


In conclusion and tangential, longwinded, response to the overall question, boiling down the ""Southern belief"" to the alternatives of states rights and slavery does a disservice to the humanity of the individuals involved.  Acknowledging the complexities of the factors that the conflict encompassed is certainly more correct and just, but still does not get to the root of ideological motivations.  However, with these factors in mind, it is possible to go a step further and examine individual actors to determine their individual motivations.  This can be accomplished in part by reviewing diary entries and letter exchanges between ordinary soldiers and their families, which are often contained in the plethora of memorandum published after the War.  However, it is wise to exercise caution when considering the text surrounding the four corners of letters contained in such publications - the recollections recorded therein are often influenced by the ""Southern Myth"" which I will not get into as it is discussed well above.   Even with (or, perhaps, including) such post war influence, I think it will be apparent that Southern motivations were unique to the individual and were subject to change over time.",AskHistorians,1

Nazi? You mean Wehrmacht? Nazi units were a small percentage of the actual fighting force and had higher casualty rates compared to the actual Wehrmacht. 

During WW1 the Wehrmacht was considered the best equipped and trained on the battlefield. The Prussian culture at the core of the Wehrmacht was strict and efficient and much respected. That could have been the origin of the opinion. 

Another take is that the engineering of tanks and or other large mechanized was very good but in terms of field repair, the high engineering standards of german armor was not easy to repair. Allied tanks were worse in terms of protection but could be repaired way faster than german armor. Mass production and fast turnaround on repairs helped the allies in ww2.

"MA in Medieval History here:

It would be problematic to say that the aristocracy and nobility were incapable of monogamy. However, I would say that adultery was not an uncommon activity. Yes, adultery was seen as a sin but it was not a capital crime like heresy. 

Religion was a very personal belief to the average medieval person, as it is today. Many people had their own internal relationship with God and did not have training in canon law or theology. There were many mixtures of pagan rites and holdovers from the Arian heresy in Europe. Mass was given in Latin which many lay people did not really understand because the languages had shifted to the vernacular versions. They knew the basics of Christianity but were really guided by the town clergy. Church attendance was not super common until the passing of Lateran IV in 1215 when the Church (at this time, there was only one) began to use life milestones (such as marriage) to insert itself into the lives of its parishioners. It used church attendance as a way to levy taxes. Parishioners were then required to attend mass at least once a year on Easter in order to be counted for a census for tax reasons. That isn't to say that you didn't have very devout Christians. You can find examples of devout Christians all over history and since you mention ""The Tudors,"" Catherine of Aragon was famously very pious. 

Fornication of any sort, if discovered, was typically punished based on gender, social status, age, religion. The older the offenders, the more they were thought to know better. If a person of higher social class wanted to rape a peasantwoman, it was thought to be permissible. Historian Vern L. Bullough stated in his article ""Prostitution in the Later Middle Ages"" that ""If a nobleman desired a peasantwoman so strongly that he could not resist the temptation, he was free to rape her on the spot since a courteous approach would only be wasted on a woman who could not possibly feel love."" If you are curious about medieval sexuality, check out Vern L. Bullough's stuff, it's really enlightening. Sexual relations before marriage were extremely common. Once a couple were betrothed, they often engaged in sexual intercourse. It was not uncommon for a bride to walk down the aisle pregnant. A woman who was promiscuous before she was betrothed could spell disaster for her reputation, especially if she was a noblewoman. This was usually because if a woman then got married, it could be difficult for her husband to prove the progeny were his. Unmarried men did not have the restrictions that women had.

If the fornicators were married individuals, obviously it was seen as a greater sin than those having sex outside of wedlock who were unmarried because it went against the sanctity of marriage and could produce illegitimate children, complicating the inheritance process. 

Did it happen? Absolutely. In general, marriage, especially in the upper classes was seen as a business transaction. Dowries were given by the bride's father to secure her marriage and was quite often a political move. Historian Pieter Spierenburg would argue that people did not really start marrying for love until the Revolution of Love in the 18th century. In that case, it was seen that some people would fulfill their marital duty but also take lovers.

In regards to the clergy not maintaining celibacy, you have to understand that a vow of celibacy was a relatively new thing to the Church in the medieval period. Lateran IV in 1215 made the vow of celibacy a mandatory practice within the Church. Prior to 1215, a priest could have taken a wive and fathered children but due to inheritance laws, children of priests were inheriting Church lands. Therefore, this was problematic to the Church and therefore, was eradicated. 

When it came to nobility, there was a very different set of rules for kings and queens. If a queen was found to have cuckolded her husband by taking a lover, it was often seen as treason for which she could be beheaded (see Anne Boleyn). By contrast, a king's mistress was often seen as a coveted and powerful position. In fact, there were even levels of mistresses at some courts with the main mistress as having a significant amount of power.

Here are some famous examples that you may be familiar with of different situations that occurred in the late medieval/renaissance that have been portrayed by popular culture:

Sir Thomas More: Was a wealthy, well-connected man who held high political office in Henry VIII's court. He was a very devout Catholic and noted to have had two happy marriages and no known mistresses.

Henry II of France - Henry II was famously known to have fallen in love with a woman who was 21 years older than him, Diane de Poitiers. Henry loved Diane so much that Diane would force him to lay with his queen, Catherine dei Medici, in order to produce heirs. This relationship is shown in the TV show Reign.

Pope Alexander VI: If you have seen the show The Borgias, you know about Rodrigo Borgia or Pope Alexander VI (fantastic performance by Jeremy Irons, highly recommend!). Pope Alexander VI famously had a decades-long affair with a thrice-married woman, Vannozza dei Cattanei, with whom he fathered four children. He also had an affair with another married woman, Guilia Farnese.

George III of England: This 18th century English king is the famous king that ruled England during the American Revolution. Another fun fact about him is that he never took a mistress and had a deep love for his queen, Charlotte of Mecklenburg with whom he fathered 15 children. He was also noted to be mad however.

To answer your question simply: Yes adultery happened but it is also so much more fun to watch it magnified in a period piece. Hope that helps answer your question!

  The Hudson's Bay Company (English, under the direction of Lord Selkirk) did absolutely employ a private military force in an effort to crack down on their rivals the Northwest Company (Scot/French).

  The inland headquarters was occupied by the regiment without a shot being fired. The NWC were aware their non-military employees would lose severely in a battle with prepared troops, and agreed to travel to Montreal for trial (Which proved wise, as they would be acquitted, and eventually countersue for losses.) During the occupation the entire fort was under the control of the HBC, with all returns, good, movements and buildings being scrutinized by the HBC. This led to disruption of trade for the NWC, and eventually a merger between the two ailing concerns.   
  In earlier, wilder years murders and such were not unheard of, with NWC partner Peter Pond being implicated (though acquitted through lack of evidence) in two.

"u/gilgamoshpit - Firstly, there are no such things as 'Counts' in the English system. The equivalent would be an Earl. But Earls didn't rule over the counties in the way you might think. By the time they came into being, they were administrative units of the kingdom administered by a number of civil positions.

But the United States *did* have a government with feudalistic roots pre-1781 - the English one. And the modern use of the term county is part of this legacy. The British used the term county when administratively dividing colonies. It was the way the English divided up territory at home and, by and large, it was the way they did it abroad. Even in Virginia, where the term 'shire' was initially used, the 'shires' were replaced with counties a short time after.

u/JustALumpOfCanadium - Australia and New Zealand did have counties when they were first settled, though these were largely used to denote the location of land. These have since been reformed, to a range of local government areas pre-1901 in Australia, and to Land Districts in New Zealand in 1989.",AskHistorians,1

The beaches were mostly defended by conscripts from Eastern Europe, who were not of the highest quality. It's likely that the British and Canadian forces on the beaches further East could have diverted enough forces to encircle the defenders at Omaha.  
However, there was one major risk. Omaha lies directly between Utah Beach and the other beaches. This was something the Germans recognised, and they attempted to drive a wedge right down the middle of the beachhead during the actual battle. It actually failed because of reinforcement from the beaches, but had a failure at Omaha prevented that, the German counterattack between the two might have succeeded.

"Not sure I understand the question. Military aircraft still are camouflaged, usually a form of Air Superiority Grey.

The two exceptions I can think of are the all-white bombers of the 50s-60s, and the bare metal aircraft such as US Army in WW2, or early Soviet cold-war.

The white, anti-flash paint was found on Britain's V-Force. The concept was simply to protect the aircraft from the effects of the A-Bombs the aircraft dropped.

In WW2, with the lack of a threat of enemy aircraft flying overhead, especially over friendly air fields, there was little purpose in green camo, and massive formations were not going to be camouflaged no matter what color it was painted. However, paint added drag and weight to the aircraft, up to several hundred pounds for a bomber. Thus in Feb 44 it was ordered to stop painting the things. This appears to have carried on to the 1960s. I have not seen anything official on the Soviet side of things but the logic would appear to continue to apply.

"It was a very long process rather than a quick switch, but it happened around the time of the Civil War. It's pretty common knowledge that the Irish were discriminated against, as were most immigrants, by nativist political parties such as the Know Nothings. This was especially true for the Irish due to the perceived threat that Catholicism posed for the largely Protestant traditions that were incumbent in the United States at the time. Nativists believed that the Irish were, for all intents and purposes, ""not white."" Their race was not simply about skin colour, but also cultural identity. Because of this, Irish immigrants were forced into the lower class (socially, economically), which they shared with other minorities.

Author Noel Ignatiev (How the Irish Became White) argues that the Irish ""became white"" following the Civil War by embracing racism. The Irish forced Black Americans out of the manual labour positions for which they competed, as well as out of their neighbourhoods. They amassed political power in the United States (through increasing population) which they used to fight abolitionism. 

The Irish appealed to the ever-present atmosphere of racism which defined the postwar era, and this helped them gain power in politics and labour movements. By treating Black Americans as the common enemy which threatened lower-class whites and politicians alike, the Irish ""became white"" and slowly made rank in American society.",AskHistorians,1

They often courted for years, as they could only marry when they had saved enough money to set themselves up as independent farmers, artisans, etcetera.

It was, however, quite common for the bride to be pregnant when marrying. Young people were pretty mobile in their search for work, and often lived in a different village or town than their parents.

"It is an over simplification, but it does have some merit. This idea is probably based in the fact that Rome spent centuries dealing with ""barbarians."" Whenever Rome expanded, they had to deal with tribes of people defending their territory. Rome often conquered these people and incorporated them into their culture. This worked in many cases, but the expansion of Rome angered many tribes who successfully managed to successfully attack. Along with this, as the Huns ravaged 4th century Northern Europe, the Romans were forced to take in people of Germanic tribes. (These are probably the immigrants people refer to.) For the most part, these people assimilated but they were treated in brutal manners by Romans. When looking for examples I found this written by Evan Andrews of History.com


>  The Romans grudgingly allowed members of the Visigoth tribe to cross south of the Danube and into the safety of Roman territory, but they treated them with extreme cruelty. According to the historian Ammianus Marcellinus, Roman officials even forced the starving Goths to trade their children into slavery in exchange for dog meat. In brutalizing the Goths, the Romans created a dangerous enemy within their own borders. When the oppression became too much to bear, the Goths rose up in revolt and eventually routed a Roman army and killed the Eastern Emperor Valens during the Battle of Adrianople in A.D. 378. The shocked Romans negotiated a flimsy peace with the barbarians, but the truce unraveled in 410, when the Goth King Alaric moved west and sacked Rome. With the Western Empire weakened, Germanic tribes like the Vandals and the Saxons were able to surge across its borders and occupy Britain, Spain and North Africa.


So Rome partially fell because of immigrants, but it was mostly because they treated the immigrants poorly. Rome consistently incorporated people into their way of life, but people has a prejudice towards what they viewed as barbarian tribesman. 

Bigger contributions to the fall of Rome would more likely be an over reliance on slavery, political instability, and splitting the Empire in half. Although the Eastern half of the Roman Empire didn't actually fall until 1453.",AskHistorians,1

It goes beyond just unbalance - a lot of NATO nations rely heavily upon the US and its armed forces to keep its own military capabilities affordable and even viable.

I want to provide an excellent example if I may, I'm only a duffer but one of my hobbies/obsessions is the [Antikythera Mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism). This device from BCE contained differential gears and is considered the wor'd firt analog computer. Possessing engineering technology that would not be replicable anywhere on Earth for almost two millennia, this device is speculated to have kept track of the position of the five known planets at the time in addition to being a lunar/solar clock. While there are some controversial instances of gliders, steam-driven apparatus, chemical battery, and other technologies, the Antikythera Mechanism is an unquestionable 'lost tech' in that the knowledge to create the base tech for the tech, if you will, was not known to exist in the interim. 

In addition, I feel it is worth mention because many of the other technologies 'lost' by various civilizations were just not useful for those civilizations. Or their utility was not understood/embraced. I actually don't think there are that many examples in history of technology's fragility, although of course the threat has always been real.

"Alright, I can actually answer this. All information is gleaned from liner notes of albums released by musicians mentioned and by study of prewar and postwar regional blues recordings.

There wasn't much of a musical change in African-American blues music following the ""Great Migration"", it was rather more of a performative alteration. To explain briefly, the shift occurred primarily as a matter of amplification: in the rural South (and consequently in prewar commercial recordings) a typical blues singer was accompanied upon an acoustic guitar. However, this format did not translate well to urban environments following the African-American demographic upheaval towards urban manufacturing centers in the war years, and it was necessary to take advantage of electric instruments and amplification in order to be heard. However, most uprooted Southern blues musicians still retained their styles (compare the first recordings of John Lee Hooker, Howlin' Wolf, and Muddy Waters to their prewar equivalents). Consequently musical changes did not really occur until the mid-1950s with the development of Chicago blues, which emphasized more of an instrumental approach based around a group musicians backing a frontman (typically a guitarist or harmonica player) rather than a singer accompanied by a single instrument typically played by the singer themselves.",AskHistorians,1

"There are a few major things which are often overlooked, when considering this battle:

1. The Byzantines were exhausted

They had been fighting the Sassanids for the last 30 years straight, the most recent (and last) episode in nearly 700 years of conflict (if you include the Roman-Sassanid and Roman-Parthian eras as parts of the same overarching conflict). This last war was especially devastating, however. That also plays into the next piece:

2. Morale

Byzantine troops were very demoralized, in sharp contrast to the Muslim armies, who were fresh and particularly pious, ready to zealously defend their newly formed faith. 

3. Landscape

The Muslim armies had camped on the higher ground, preceding the battle, which also happened to be the only elevated ground in the area, as the battle took place on a plain. This gave them excellent means to survey the battlefield and plan beforehand. Planning actually brings us to our next piece:

4. Logistical strain 
Not only is commanding such an enormous army very difficult (especially at the time), but the Byzantines had not organized a large army together in one location like this for multiple centuries, instead preferring to spread their forces throughout a campaign (Perhaps al-Walid knew this, and took advantage of it, as the Muslims purposefully sought a large and decisive battle). This already provides with the foreshadowing of a Pyrrhic victory *at the least* for the Byzantines. Not only this, but supplying this army was a logistical nightmare, and they suffered some degree of attrition before the battle even began. 

5. Disagreeing Generals

Deep-seated tensions and rivalries plagued the Byzantine generals involved, not only in the context of power struggles within the empire but also given ethno-religious disagreements, seeing as the Byzantine generals involved came from a mixture of Greek, Armenian, and Christian Arab backgrounds. Note also: the Byzantines were using 7 generals to command an army of ~150,000, and the Muslims were using nearly twice as many generals to command a force of ~20,000 (well-cooperating generals from a uniform ethnoreligious background, no less [if memory serves]).

The Byzantines were aware of the enormous issues at hand, and actually attempted to seek a diplomatic solution with the Muslims before engaging in battle. By this, and the Muslims intentionally amassing their armies in one location, one thing becomes clear: the Muslims wanted this battle, and the Byzantines very much did not. That should tell you something about the morale and mindsets of each involved side. 

It was all of these factors, and more, that led to one of the most disastrous battles in history and the capture of the Levant. 

**TLDR**: Lack of Byzantine planning, poor morale and in-fighting between generals with undersupplied troops vs fresh Arab armies with high morale, excellent coordination, and genius generals. ",AskHistorians,1

By 1900, 34 states had compulsory schooling laws; four were in the South. 30 states with compulsory schooling laws required attendance until age 14 (or higher). As a result, by 1910, 72 percent of American children attended school. Half the nation's children attended one-room schools. In 1918, every state required students to complete elementary school.[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_the_United_States). 

There are plenty of articles out there outlining the advancement of education, but the point is, I'm wondering if the question isn't one of how federal guidelines and federal control of educational content and accreditation has effected education?

At no point in any of the events leading to 1867 was the US' independence day taken into account as far as any recorded material suggest. 

It would also be truly unlikely because, despite a few flashpoints in the 19th century between the British empire and the US, such as the war of 1812 and the Oregon boundary dispute, enmity between the two countries was rapidly fading. Trade between the US and the UK exploded in this period, far above anything seen in the colonial era, and the UK was at the peak of it's power despite the loss of the thirteen colonies.

"So your second question is whether the US was the only country whose slavers sent slaves home rather than to overseas colonies? Well, okay, I first have to say that the US was that overseas colony for a long time, but you know that. Anyway, the answer is no. Spain and Portugal sent African slaves to the Iberian peninsula. After a while, though, African slavery became associated with the colonial plantation economy and slaves were no longer sent to Europe as often, and it wasn't until then that Britain and France (and the Netherlands, etc.) became involved in the slave trade. Some enslaved people did end up in England and France, but it wasn't a systematic sort of thing like the transatlantic trade was. Eventually, the Somerset decision in Britain and a similar decision by the king in France (I forget the specifics of this, sorry) restricted slavery in those empires to the colonies. 

So my understanding is that the British always thought of American slavery as a cruel and barbaric institution, even when they tolerated it in their empire. Nobody in Britain of any importance actually defended slavery, but prior to American independence, people thought of it as just sort of part and parcel of New World empire. Christopher Brown argues in *Moral Capital: Foundations of British Abolitionism* that the loss of the thirteen colonies allowed the British to separate slavery and empire and think of Africans as possible imperial subjects rather than simply exploitable sources of labor. It will probably not surprise you to find out that British writers picked up on the irony of American slaveholders arguing for freedom, hence the famous quote from Samuel Johnson: ""How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?"" Because we contemporary people accept the notion of natural rights, we wonder how high-minded rights-of-man types like Madison and Jefferson could have reconciled their philosophy with holding people in bondage, and we conclude that they must have been hypocrites, or blinded by racism, or just men of their times, or whatever. That's not what British conservatives were doing. They didn't think the Americans were hypocrites; they thought they were wrong. They argued that the idea of natural rights was crap and even Madison and Jefferson didn't believe it, since they continued to hold people in bondage -- they were just using this rhetoric as a smokescreen as they illegitimately attempted to grab power for themselves. But just as slaves were useful rhetorically during the American war of independence, they were useful militarily, too. Most famously, the governor of Virginia, Dunmore, offered freedom to enslaved people who served among the Royal Forces. Brown argues that these developments allowed the British to begin seeing slavery as a system supported by political arrangements (that could be dissolved), rather than just some unpleasant fact about the New World. 

So anyway, after the loss of the thirteen colonies, there was kind of a crisis of confidence in Britain and a worry that empire was making Britain greedy and sinful, and that losing the war might have been God's punishment. This, Brown argues opened the door for ameliorationism (the idea that slavery should be made more humane) and finally for the abolition of the slave trade and the abolition of slavery altogether. This would show the world that it was really Britain that was on the side of the angels and that the US was just a crappy little renegade province run by power-mad anarchists, not the last great hope of mankind.

I'm not an expert on the history of Britain, like at all, but my understanding is that slavery was like THE THING that defined the US in Britain during the nineteenth century. I've seen a British children's book about the countries of the world that illustrated the United States with a picture of two crazed white men on horses, trampling and whipping a crowd of black people. Lectures by American abolitionists were incredibly popular throughout Britain prior to the Civil War -- many prominent former slaves active in the abolitionist movement time in Britain writing and doing the whole nineteenth-century lecture circuit thing. They write very movingly about racial tolerance in Britain and being treated as equals by white people for the first time.

"Just as a start, The Battle For God by Karen Armstrong covers the period pretty well from a religious history perspective, although she's a religion scholar and not a historian. It does a very good job highlighting the importance of the rise of Pentecostalism as a new movement mostly attracting lower-class people in the South. The revivalist culture of the early 20th century is not exactly an obscure thing (the highly religious United States' Secretary of State in the 1910s, William Jennings Bryan, refused to serve alcohol at state functions for religious reasons, much to the chagrin of many foreign diplomats) and Protestant revival culture's role in Prohibition can be seen in books like Daniel Okrent's Last Call: the Rise and Fall of Prohibition.

By the 1920s, that wave of religiosity had mostly run its course and was becoming a subject of ridicule (see the popularity of Sinclair Lewis' novel Elmer Gantry, a book mocking an ultra-pious Protestant minister who was secretly an adulterer and a drunk). The Pyrrhic victory of the religious types in the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial, which turned William Jennings Bryan and the evangelical set in general into figures of ridicule, is a pretty good marker for the end of the Third Great Awakening.",AskHistorians,1
"It should also be noted that the Hudson Bay Company remains a prominent icon of Canadian commerce to this day-- it is a significant department store chain that can be found in all major Canadian cities and many small towns. It is a [publicly traded enterprise] (http://web.tmxmoney.com/quote.php?qm_symbol=HBC) valued at nearly $8bn Canadian. I am not exaggerating when I say that in my Canadian house, sitting on my HBC bedspread *as we speak.*

A little more on HBC's role in Canada. One of the most significant products produced by HBC is the iconic [point blanket] (http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/faq/pointblanketfaq/default#1), first made and sold in 1780. The blankets are made of a rich, thick wool, which made them incredibly valuable in the harsh Canadian winters. 

While the blankets are still fairly ubiquitous as a symbol of Canada, they have taken on a particular value in the culture of the Indigenous peoples of the prairies (Cree, Saulteaux, Metis in particular.) In modern Canada, great pains are taken to involve Indigenous peoples in decision making, ceremonies, research, and so on. Most institutional decision making involves consulting with Elders-- respected older people within their communities. To appropriately address an Elder when asking advice, the standard protocol is to offer [tobacco or cloth] (https://carleton.ca/aboriginal/resources/guidelines-for-working-with-elders/)-- ideally thick cloth, like [blankets.] (http://www.provost.ualberta.ca/en/~/media/provost/Documents/CAI/Elders.pdf)

HBC blankets are widely considered the starting point of this ceremonial tradition; Indigenous people traded beaver furs caught with their superior hunting methods for, among other things, blankets. However, the history of the HBC blanket is a double-edged colonial metaphor. There is a widespread hoax that in the 18th century, HBC blankets were deliberately infected with smallpox by British General [James Amherst] (http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/amherst_jeffery_4E.html) and distributed to Six Nation people in what is now Ontario and Quebec to sicken and kill them. This story has been dismissed as apocryphal, but given the tenuous and often fraught relationship between Indigenous people and colonial Canadians it has sustained itself as a story.

As a minor anecdote-- during a meeting between the Saskatoon Tribal Council and myself, in Saskatchewan, Canada, one of the Elders got a glimpse of my HBC [phone case] (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2d/5a/c3/2d5ac389f1ebcd1ce4e668f8ced0882d.jpg) which looks like the blankets and I *did not hear the end of it.* Whenever we met on policy issues, they called me Miss Hudson Bay and joked about when the smallpox would be arriving.",AskHistorians,1

I am going to assume that you are a student, and that you have decent access to academic resources. 

I will start with a strong advice: most ""experts"" here are not academic historians. They may be trained in history, but very few are working as an academic historian. So I strongly suggest that you take all advice here with lots of salt, mine included. Have you asked your academic advisors for advice tailored to somebody aspiring to be an academic historian? At what stage are you at this point? 

Have you read the [Monday Methods series on grad school](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4z0poh/monday_methods_so_i_heard_youd_like_to_go_to_grad/)? /u/commiespaceinvader has posted a series of threads. 

>Is it possible (and, if so, common) to have two separate focus areas? 

Never say never, but at the same time what is possible is not always what is wise. Name some of your favorite academic historians and tell me which ones have two focus areas. How far apart are they? 

>How long of a time period do historians usually focus on?

For what area of history? It depends on the depth of the focus, geographic span, availability of research material. Tell me some of your favorite PhD theses and tell me the span of their time periods, geographic span, subject focus. 

If somebody purports to write a PhD thesis on ""History of the East Indies, 1500-1850"", I expect that thesis to be at least 800 pages long. Somebody who writes a PhD thesis on ""The evolution of the Chinese tributary trade in Manila, 1500-1850"" can probably get away with a more reasonable 300 pages.

It's not at all.

"All of the following information comes from [the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on homosexuality](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/homosexuality/).

>I also haven't really seen any definitive stories of violence against people in same-sex marriages until recent years--at the same time, I haven't heard of much violence or even explicit legal discrimination against homosexuals/bisexuals/etc. until the 20th century, either.

Homosexuality and bisexuality are recent categories. However, plenty of violence and legal discrimination were directed at ""sodomites"" before the twentieth century:

>The latter part of the twelfth through the fourteenth centuries, however, saw a sharp rise in intolerance towards homosexual sex, alongside persecution of Jews, Muslims, heretics, and others. 

>For the next several centuries in Europe, the laws against homosexual sex were severe in their penalties. Enforcement, however, was episodic. In some regions, decades would pass without any prosecutions. Yet the Dutch, in the 1730's, mounted a harsh anti-sodomy campaign (alongside an anti-Gypsy pogrom), even using torture to obtain confessions. As many as one hundred men and boys were executed and denied burial (Greenberg, 1988, 313-4).

But of course, the laws, their penalties, and their enforcement varied across time and place:

>At times, even with the risk of severe punishment, same-sex oriented subcultures would flourish in cities, sometimes only to be suppressed by the authorities. In the 19th century there was a significant reduction in the legal penalties for sodomy. The Napoleonic code decriminalized sodomy, and with Napoleon's conquests that Code spread. Furthermore, in many countries where homosexual sex remained a crime, the general movement at this time away from the death penalty usually meant that sodomy was removed from the list of capital offenses.

You seem to think that religion is the force behind discrimination. It is important to recognize that secular forces have helped to construct our understanding of sexuality. ""Homosexuality"" is a medical term. And, while doctors argued that it makes no sense to criminalize homosexual attraction or behavior, they also argued that homosexuality was pathological. But, that being said:

>is it really something that has been consistently looked down upon since the birth of Christ?

The early Church fathers disliked all forms of sex. Eventually, their stance softened into an opposition toward just non-procreative sex, which then lent itself to severe persecution of sodomites:

>What is clear, however, is that while condemnation of same-sex attraction is marginal to the Gospels and only an intermittent focus in the rest of the New Testament, early Christian church fathers were much more outspoken. In their writings there is a horror at any sort of sex, but in a few generations these views eased, in part due no doubt to practical concerns of recruiting converts. By the fourth and fifth centuries the mainstream Christian view allowed for procreative sex.

>This viewpoint, that procreative sex within marriage is allowed, while every other expression of sexuality is sinful, can be found, for example, in St. Augustine. This understanding leads to a concern with the gender of one's partner that is not found in previous Greek or Roman views, and it clearly forbids homosexual acts. Soon this attitude, especially towards homosexual sex, came to be reflected in Roman Law. In Justinian's Code, promulgated in 529, persons who engaged in homosexual sex were to be executed, although those who were repentant could be spared. ",AskHistorians,1

One of the main thrusts of denazification was to literally punish party leaders as criminals. The Nuremberg Trials were intentionally made transparent and widely accessible by tv/news outlets to highlight the criminal acts of the Nazis and to display western intolerance for the party, it's leaders and its beliefs. Leaders found guilty of war crimes were executed. There was no quarter, there was no negotiation. 

The relentless hunting of Nazi party leaders, in conjunction with the very public trials can be considered counter-propaganda by the allies against the Nazi system. The last thing the allies wanted was a Nazi Renaissance down the line, where the party reformed and tapped into the entire generation it indoctrinated. 

The results of denazification were positive. The allies were able to install pro-democratic leadership in west Germany. Moreover, the leadership began to instill anti-Nazi ideologies in the public through laws and regulations. Many of these laws/regs can still be seen in modern Germany. It is illegal to be a Nazi, positive references cannot be made about Nazis, swastikas are prohibited, etc. All of these measures can be traced back to the efforts of the allies and their plan of denazification. So, to answer your question very generally: it was impossible to be a Nazi sympathizer after the war. Sympathizing with the party or attempting to reform it would carry with it severe penalties. 

In sum, denazification was a necessary countermeasure by the allies to ensure Nazism was dead and buried. The Nazis spent millions of dollars and close to twenty years poisoning the public and creating within it a ""superiority complex."" Left unchecked, that mentality would have inevitably reared its head again and brought the world to the brink of war. 

A brief side note: many people will claim that Operation Paperclip flouted the tenets of denazification. While true, these people also seem to forget that just as we buried our greatest enemy a new one arose (USSR) almost immediately thereafter. We needed to ensure our dominance in military technology. Without the efforts of Operation Paperclip, the results of the Cold War may have been vastly different.

"Clearly the later ""real"" weapons were of a slightly different design, and usually higher quality than the original ""prune on a stick"".

There were several factors to the use of these weapons: they were available, they were of a design known to and recreatable by the average blacksmith, they were relatively cheap.

They were good enough to worry about.


*Did they differentiate between improvised peasant weapons and ones made for combat?*

I do not exactly understand what you mean here, differentiate in what way, naming, price, usage?




*Did the quality of armament matter, or was the person holding it more important?*

The quality of the armament, although important, is but a single factor. The person holding it can have good or bad weapons-training, a good or bad physical condition, good or bad morale, discipline etc etc, in the end I would rate the warrior probably more important than his or her arms, if only because a warrior has more factors than a weapon. But it's an age-old question without a clear-cut answer, there are arguments to be made for either premise.




*Were these ""light light infantry"", fodder, or more-or-less as good as anyone else on the field?*



In most cases the former, the other people on the field being knights, men-at-arms and mercenaries, all professional soldiers compared to the peasants and citizens. But that didn't make the knights and such automatically victorious, as we can see in instances such as [the Battle of the Golden Spurs](https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-the-Golden-Spurs).

"There are multiple reasons why the medieval era is often referred to as the ""Dark Ages"". Know that the term is applied to *western Europe*, and not other areas of the world who were doing quite well at the time, such as the East and Middle East. In popular use, the ""Dark Ages"" connotates a drop in the quality of life, which is lwrgely supported. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE, the Gauls, Romans and Germans were all scrambling around with little unification. Some tribes like the Franks took advantage of this and conquered much of continental western Europe. Britain also saw an invasion of Germans, the Anglo-Saxons, from the fifth to the seventh century. More invasions from the North would be underway in later centuries during the Viking Age. These military threats largely caused the adoption of the societal structure of feudalism, which made territory divide into hundreds of localized kingdoms with little communication between them. When unification did come, it was in the form of corrupt absolute monarchies who were politically wedded with the also corrupt Church, which helped make economic growth and technological innovation stagnate. But the ""Dark Ages"" also comes from historians not knowing as much about that era, as people had less time to write for those reasons.",AskHistorians,1
"Now I sadly have no sources to provide on this since it is from my history class. But I'll try to explain it. You people are free to correct me. 

The reasons are mainly geographical, diplomatic, and economical. 

What is rarely mentioned is that the Islamic nations are among the main reasons the Americas were discovered in the first place. The Islamic nations controlled large portions of the silk route and as result European traders hat to pay high taxes for trade with China. As a result there were tensions between Europe and the Islamic nations, tensions that also led to sea blockades I think. Europeans discovered America because they were searching for another way to China so that they didn't have to pay the taxes. 

Now coming to the development of sea travel, in these terms many Islamic nations were behind compared to Spain or Portugal. And exception to this would be the Ottoman empire, but at this time the ottomans were too occupied with their conquest in europe to travel West. 

Then among the last points is that they were simply too late. In this time travelling took a long ass time and for information to travel to another nation (especially one you weren't on the best terms with) also took a while. When the Islamic leaders then finally turned their eyes to the Americas, most of the known territory was already owned by the British, Spanish or Portuguese.

"Simply snatching someone else's ID documents probably wouldn't work unless they were very close in appearance, weight, height, eye color, etc., especially if the ID included a photo. In the days before the Internet and computer databases, the most common way of assuming a new identity was to do a little research in the local cemeteries and find the graves of babies who had died around the time you were born. You would then apply to the local hospital for a birth certificate, use that to apply for Social Security number, and with those two things you could then turn into that person. 

Someone who understood that process could do the same thing after the war, taking the name of another soldier that they knew to be dead. Once you were back home under your own name, there would be almost nothing to stop you from relocating away from your home town and adopting the name of that dead soldier, requesting a birth certificate, Social Security number, etc. You would have to know enough about that soldier to know his home town so you'd know where to get the birth certificate, so your new identity would likely be someone you knew. There would be a few difficulties, in that the person had lived a portion of his life, and would possibly already have a Social Security number. They were new back then, so perhaps he joined the war before being assigned one.  

There could be other potential complications, but many soldiers joined straight out of high school, and didn't have much of a foot print before the war. So if you were to adopt his identity and use it on the other side of the country, it would be very possible that you would never be found out, provided you chose a name that was fairly common and not some name that was unusual in some way. Your old identity would simply vanish from disuse, and people would assume that you went missing during the chaos of war. Without mass communication like we have today, it would be very difficult for someone to investigate and track your movements around the country.

"Well my question is more about the definition of ""bad discrimination"" itself. It seems pretty early on in our history, most educated people recognized that certain uncontrollable characteristics of a person did not determine their actions, habits and who they were as people. 

My question is, when did we decide, that similarly for most religious people, their religion does not significantly determine their actions, habits and who they were as people? In other words, when did we as a society quietly decide that, #1, most religions are inherently similar and #2, most ""religious"" people place their culture's morals above their religion's morals.

We as a soceity did not always believe these two things, which is why religious discrimination was tolerated for so long.  

>  The First Amendment, for example, protects an individual's right to ""exercise"" their religion,

But isn't the First Amendment is just a protection of your civil freedoms from the government? It has nothing to do with preventing discrimination from individual people. Of course the Founders were all familiar with religious persecution but I don't think they ever thought of preventing discrimination on a person-to-person level.

Another angle to this to consider is that Russia was exploring and trading in Alaska in the late 1600s and had established Ft. Ross in Northern California by 1812.

"Well, I'm probably at risk of joining the invisible comments here because I'm having a hard time getting good sources since I'm not on my academic network currently, but nonetheless here we go:

We have basically no primary sources from Iron and Bronze age Britain, because the pre-Roman Britons were essentially illiterate; so it's difficult to say with any real certainty. However there is evidence of trade between the British Isles and Mediterranean cultures going back to the Bronze Age, most particularly the Phoenicians and their descendants (namely Carthage), largely based around the export of tin from the uniquely rich deposits in the southwest of the isle. We later have writings from Greek and Roman sources that indicate similar trade relations with the Britons. 

Pytheas of Massilia, a Greek merchant from a city on the southern coast of what is now France, wrote of his journey through the isles, which includes discussion of the extensive tin trade. His original writings have not survived, but he is referenced by later scholars.

Diodorus Siculus in his *Library of History* speaks of the Celtic passion for Italian wines, an observation later reiterated by Julius Caesar in his own writing on his conquests in Gaul (who also notes their interest in cattle).

Additionally there is archaeological evidence in the form of shipwrecks and pottery shards from throughout the period which corroborate at least the wine and tin trades.

With such an extensive trade network it is extremely likely that the pre-Roman Britons at the least had an awareness of Rome and its geographic location, though bearing in mind the relative inaccuracy of ancient cartography that awareness was likely quite vague for all but those few merchant which plied the trade routes themselves.

This is an interesting question, because depending on how broad you take it, the answer could also be: Not at all, since the Soviets would have won without help (or at least with lend-lease only).

Today, most western people hugely underestimate the share of German military the Soviets fought against.

For example, Glantz argues that the importance of lend-lease should not be underestimated, but that the war was probably already pretty much won for the Soviets, when it got really going. Meaning that it only shortened the war (a lot).

Europe developed their notion of the mandate which we call divine right much later on. 

The other reason was inheritance. Let's look at the Frankish kingdoms for example: king dies, and has X children. Well then the land is divided between the kids. This leads to tons of infighting and wars that weaken the dynasty. Chinese emperors had many concubines and wives and hence many kids, but there was only ever ONE heir. Infighting went on while the emperor was alive to determine who that heir would be, but as it stands the empire was bequeathed to one person. 

China also had an efficient bureaucracy that helped run the empire, it wasn't feudal despite what American history textbooks will tell you. Most were eunuchs and so had their sole loyalty to the emperor. Not the case with medieval Europe. 

In terms of Rome, it's the current historical consensus that the empire created the emperors and not the other way around. Essentially the republic got too large and needed the efficient leadership of one man. The issue is that the succession was never fully ironed out. Keep in mind that this whole paragraph is a basic answer. For more info I'd recommend Mary Beard's SPQR. Excellent read.

"> When did we, **ordinary citizens**, begin to conceptualize it?

Your question seems to ponder when the laymen could afford to get involved into political discussions and have access to such ressources, am I correct?

Building off this assumption..
Before the 'state' was recognized as a philosophical entity the average layman and even nobility, clergy, and the like, had differing philosophies to uphold to. One of the first that comes to mind is patronage. Others would be faith or familiar ties. They could uphold these low-communication required modes of loyalties due to their low requirement for much communication(i.e. the farmer did not need to know what was happening past his farm and their patron).

Before the introduction of mass democratization and social rights the average laymen could not afford to participate in politics. This left 'the state' being a tightly closed circle of relatively few individuals to govern the state, which required, relative to early modern times, very few modes of communication. The low number of political participants made it so there was no economic incentive to distribute political pamphlets or information. The media market was thus mainly left for propoganda, or economically viable sources like advertisement or retail brochures. The laymens could not afford political philosophy books, nor would they have a reason to do so; why read about politics when you can't get involved in it? A layman could thus live his life through patronage and not need 'the state.'

Once individual laymen could better involve themselves into politics(with the laxing of the class Vs politics laws) then there began an incentive for the laymen to educate themselves for their new voting duties and for the politicians to educate the masses(which usually resulted in an increase of mass propoganda). This along with publishing becoming more widespread and urbanization becoming the norm, made it so the communication of politics was more essential and accessible. Once the rights to vote were granted to laymen, and thus social policies enacted, the layman had gained a sort of patronage to the state.

So to answer to your question: When did we begin to conceptualize it?

We never really had a starting point. There can be no date attached to the answer; it is much more of a speculative answer than a concrete one. It was all progressive and interdependant on many factors. From social to technological to economic to political, each of them had a respective factor in the equation. Some could argue that the military, science, ecology, and every other 'history' also played a factor. These people are not wrong.

In short, once state politics became accessible and available to the public then they became involved in it too.

Faults of this thesis:

Let's crank out some faults in my answer. First we'll recognize a lack of sources. Shame me. I shouldn't be writting when away from my source databank.
Second, my answer is philosophically based rather than concrete facts(i.e. the lack of showing the price drop of publishing over years, or showing the progression of social state policies, or the increase in sales/availability of state philosophy, and any other correlations tied into those latter subjects and the like). I blame my lack of available sources and my recent readings on Bertrand Russell for this.
Third, my answer is very Occidental focused.
Fourth, there are no dates correlating my statements, although I would have to innacuratly estimate it as an ever increasing significant force from 1800's-present, but there have been definitive signs of 'state patronage' before this time and as such the date is simply misleading.

A police officer generally wouldn't need more than the six rounds of a revolver for typical street crime, where it is rare enough to need to fire your weapon and rarer still to need more than 3 or 4 shots.  A soldier in a battle on the other hand might use his firearm to shoot dozens of rounds, and so high capacity and low reload time was paramount. If a police officer encountered that level of trouble, they would call in teams with rifles and other weapons more powerful than a handgun.

Next is cost. Revolvers, with a simpler mechanism, were/are cheaper to produce than semi automatic pistols.  There was simply not enough of a benefit in that time period to having street cops armed with semis as over revolvers.",AskHistorians,1

"Well that really depends on what kind of medieval soldier you were. For instance at Crécy in 1346 (and many other battles of this period) prepared positions of dismounted English men-at-arms flanked by archers withstood charge after charge of French cavalry. However, these were extremely experienced soldiers who were trained to fight on foot and maintain cohesion. They were heavily armored and had swords and lances. Men-at-arms were basically knights, squires and other elite warriors without the lands and lineage to sustain knighthood or gentility. Furthermore the cavalry suffered grievous losses from the archers on the flanks of the men at arms. This strategy was incredibly effective and led to the end of the cavalry age of medieval warfare. Ironically during this time armies also became almost entirely mounted, so the men-at-arms and archers would travel on horseback and then dismount to fight. This also allowed men-at-arms to remount their horses at the opportune moment and charge the enemy formation, as happened famously at Poitiers in 1356 when Sir James Audley and the Captal de Buch launched flanking cavalry charges against the French army and won the day. 

On the other hand, inexperience soldiers were completely vulnerable to cavalry. Without the proper training or equipment, cavalry charges could easily destroy much larger infantry formations, as happened countless time, for instance during the 1358 Jacquerie.

"Most academic historians don't really deal directly with questions of morality. You'll see other responses indicate that they do - and sure, personally, most historians probably feel like people in the past did terrible things. They're also in the past, and have no ability to justify or argue for their actions. In essence, we're able to judge them, but they have no recourse. As historians we're generally careful about doing such a thing.

The colonization of North America took hundreds of years, involved millions (if not tens, or hundreds) of individuals, in addition to likely hundreds of state, tribal, and non-state actors. Describing every person involved in such an event as 'immoral' to me is somewhat unhelpful. Individuals are moral, not groups numbering in the tens of millions. Talking about individuals is similarly unhelpful. One can say, something like 'Christopher Columbus didn't act in accord with his professed Christian values', but what does this tell us? That he was a hypocrite, like many other people? That's not a very interesting historical argument to make - that some people are bad and do something different than they say. A three year old can tell you that. Historians tend to look at questions without such easy answers. For instance, many historians have taken for granted that nearly all land in the colonial period was simply stolen from native groups. Recent research into this conventional wisdom has actually turned this on its head - much of the land was purchased (I recommend *How the Indians Lost their Land* by Stuart Banner). Does this mean historians morally excuse such actions. No. But it means that a simple moral answer ('people stole land from Indians') actually obscured a more complex reality.

"It seems to me that even though the Kingdom of the East and West Indias was thousands of times larger and more populous than an Irish tuath, and had much more refined state functions, a ri ruling a Tuath was just as royal as the King of the East and West Indias.

It seems to me that if the title of the ruler of a northern or western European polity was usually translated into Latin as rex, he was by definition a king.  The king of England was not accepted as a king by Germans, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Italians, etc., because he used the title of king in English, but because his title was given as rex in Latin documents including those by non English persons.

So if medieval Irish documents in Latin normally translate ri as rex, you will have to accept that a ri was a rex, and thus a king in English.

It seems to me that it is easy to assume that all kings were like modern European kings, the sovereigns of modern European states that covered large territories largely equivalent to national homelands and had large government bureaucracy.

And during the 1800s and early 1900s when a European country became independent it selected a king or its duke or prince was promoted to king. This created the popular image of a kingdom as a sovereign and independent nation.  But even during that era that idea was contradicted by the German Empire that contained four kingdoms from 1871 to 1918.

Such ideas that kingdoms have to be large national states with extensive state apparatus and bureaucracy are wrong.  The vast majority of kings through history have been very different from those unusual modern European kings that should not be considered typical kings.",AskHistorians,1

The Carolingian Dynasty had no direct connection to the preceeding dynasty, The Mirovingians, but took power though a gradual power struggle and appointment by the pope.

The Emperor was effectively an elected 'president' of the territories, and the territories had the practical ability to choose their allegiance.  Most banded together in the HRE for the mutual protection it gave each principality to invasion from surrounding countries, the support of similar-minded princes/local lords, or the central governmental structure provided by the Emperor's administration (such that it was).

This complication and uncertainty was exactly what led to the 30 years war: the Emperor thought he could dictate his desires to the member territories, and a large number of territories disagreed with him.",AskHistorians,1

"Good point about ""vulnerable"" economies. I'm sure that when trade systems of one empire became severely disrupted, it affected the whole trade system of the Eurasian world to a degree. This was certainly the case for the internal economy of the Roman Empire, with its contiguous parts that relied and were dependent on each other for far-flung trade, so that areas like Britannica were relying on goods coming from as far away as Roman Syria. With the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and state authorities to ensure security and free movement of goods and people, this trade system naturally went down the drain. Compare it to the state of things in the Early Middle Ages, when the kings of France were fearful of straying too far from Paris in the threat of being literally kidnapped by rival nobles for a ransom. This changed dramatically with the enhancement of the central power of monarchies across Europe during the High Middle Ages. Even ""balkanized"" areas like northern Italy saw a flourishing of trade between city-states and republics thanks to the maritime routes around the Adriatic, Ligurian, and Tyrrhenian seas within the Mediterranean, once the persistent threat of Arab and Berber raids were finally squashed by the Normans.

"To my knowledge, the longest pikes ever used in war are the Late Hellenistic phalangites' *sarissa* pikes, which could be over 20 feet in length. However, these were still meant to be wielded by one person. When pikemen made a comeback in the 15th century AD, the pikes they used were significantly shorter.

The problem with a 2-man pike would be that it severely reduces the mobility and flexibility of the men carrying it. This is already a problem with the *sarissa*; anyone who could get beyond the pike's point could no longer be harmed by the pikeman, and anyone who could get at a block of pikemen from the side or rear would render the pikemen completely helpless. For protection, men wielding long pikes must rely on wide, dense formations, which in turn are vulnerable to disruption when moving across a battlefield. A field wall, a ditch, a slope, even a single tree can cause major disruption in a pike formation. Unless the battlefield was prepared in advance, pikemen could be easily thrown into chaos. All of these problems would be massively worsened by the use of pikes that need 2 men to wield them.

Meanwhile it's hard to see what advantage could be gained from yoking 2 men to a single pike. They wouldn't be able to do anything more than a single man could do, and if each man has one pike, those 2 men also have two deadly weapons aimed at the enemy instead of one.",AskHistorians,0

"As sunagainstgold says, the Gawain poet used a version of the West Midlands dialect. This would have been (relatively) far removed from the influence of the main nobility and aristocracy based in London. Chaucer, being based in London and part of the ""clerical bureaucracy,"" would have been writing in the courtly dialect. 

Now keep in mind I'm not a linguist but rather just a literary scholar of the period but the context you likely lacked in determining the genesis of the dialects of the Gawain poem vs Chaucer is that after the Normans invaded in 1066 the language of the nobility became heavily influenced by the French language. This is what eventually gave rise to Middle English. First the nobility and then the common folk assimilated bits of French grammar, syntax, pronunciation, etc. The further removed from the political centers, the slower the dialect in that area morphed.

To really drive the point home here is a short passage from the Anglo-Saxon (the language spoken in England before the Normans invaded) poem ""Exodus"":

*Folc wæs afæred; flodegsa becwom*

*gastas geomre, geofon deadðe hweop.*

*Wæron beorhhliðu blode bestemed,*

*holm heolfre spaw, hream wæs on yðum,*

*wæter wæpna ful, wælmist astah.*

As you can see, SGGK is more similar to this earlier language of England than Chaucer is. Now I will caveat all of that by saying that it is not uncommon for modern editions to modernize the language and spelling. So the passage from Chaucer may have looked a bit more similar to SGGK in its original manuscripts (can't say for sure. Chaucer was a bit late for my focus) but even then, just based on what words are used in the two poems it becomes obvious that SGGK was written in a dialect that retained more of the older vernacular than the dialect of Chaucer.

(The passage taken from Exodus starts at Line 447. I used the Exeter Press Edition, Edited by Peter J. Lucas. It is a scholarly edition meant for mid-level Anglo-Saxon students and so much of the spelling and punctuation has been standardized to make it easier on modern readers. Also, I just picked a passage basically at random. If you want a translation just ask but it has no relevance to the current discussion outside being an example of Anglo-Saxon.)",AskHistorians,0

Among the more horrible deprivations (for Italy at least) of the wars of the triumvirs was the near-total stranglehold Sextus Pompey had on the grain supply from Africa. Following his proscription in 43 Sextus Pompey assumed total control over Sicily and Sardinia, cutting off the grain supply from those two vital provinces--by 40 he had invaded Corsica and was making landings in Bruttium at the south of Italy in support of Lucius Antony's Perusine War. Sextus Pompey cut off the grain supply from Africa and Sicily so effectively that despite the Pact of Brundisium the triumvirs were forced in 39 to recognize Sextus Pompey in their schemes as governor of Corsica, Sicily, Sardinia, and Achaea in Greece with the Treaty of Misenum. He was never able to fully extend his control over Africa and lost Corsica and Sardinia in 38, but his last years of control in Sicily were some of the most horrible for the city, as Sextus Pompey's fleet actively pursued a policy of blockade and was fairly successful for a time at preventing Agrippa from decisively defeating him. I can't think of any time at which Antony cut off the grain trade from Egypt (which would not necessarily have been particularly successful), although there might be something I'm forgetting--what you're describing seems to suggest more an attempt to make reference to the disruption of the grain trade by Sextus Pompey, who as I recall is not actually in the series at all",AskHistorians,0
"History is literally the study of everything that has ever happened with human beings associated with it. It is the study of change over time, the study of cultures, the study of individuals. It is the study of ideas, of war, of politics, of economics, of science and technology. It is the study of why things happened, it is the study of what could have been different. It is a detective game at times, searching for elusive clues to puzzling riddles, for new sources of evidence and insight. It is an exercise in interpretation of a vast amount of different kinds of data and evidence. 

At times it involves a form of radical empathy and extreme subjectivity, in our attempt to inhabit the minds, bodies, and worlds of the long deceased. It is at its heart an empirical narrative craft: we take our interpretations, data, and so forth and turn them into stories that resonate, reveal, and require creativity and art to construct. 

At its deepest level, our study is the human condition. Who are we? How did the world end up the way it is? And, let's be honest, we are all somewhat interested in this in part because it lends insight (though not certainty) to the always pressing questions about the future: Where are we going? What kinds of change is possible and desirable? 

History is not the only way to study these kinds of questions, or to produce these kinds of works. But it is far more broad in its approaches, more honest in its fallibilities, and more pluralistic and synthetic in its methodology than any other field of study that attempts to answer comparable questions. It happily benefits from insights provided by fields such as archeology, linguistics, literature, philosophy, anthropology, economics, sociology, psychology, and even the ""harder"" sciences. But it skirts atop all of them, picking and choosing, and producing something (the narrative) that tries to be rich, deep, and plausible. 

These narratives can have an ""overstuffed couch"" quality to them (comfortable but unwieldy, with dubious and uncertain bits and pieces hanging out) especially when contrasted with the colder, harder output that many of these fields desire. But when they work well, they strike something deep in the human mind — narrative is, it seems, the major way that our brains have evolved to understand the world, one of the few cross-cultural givens.

Anyone who thinks any given historical narrative will, by itself, last forever is fooling themselves, because historians know that we, the historians, are embedded in history as well. We accept that, and know that the next generation of historians will, with exquisite care and ability, show why our narratives are ""wrong"" and theirs are ""better."" That's fine. The best historians understand that the knowledge we create is of a different sort than the hard sciences, but that doesn't diminish its importance, usefulness, or value.

I am dreadfully, obviously biased, but to study history is to study humanity in its broadest spectrum of forms, with the broadest brushes. To write history is its own magisterial endeavor, a form of empirical creativity that rewards depth and contemplation. It sits at a very comfortable intersection of the arts and the social sciences, but dips a toe in nearly everything else. It rewards the synthetic thinkers, it rewards the dogged searchers, it rewards the storytellers. 

History has something for everyone, if you search for it. Those who bore of history are bored of life! Unless they are specifically bored of history _class_ which, we can all acknowledge, is an entirely different thing. 

(None of the above should be interpreted to endorse history as a good career move. What is worth doing, and what society values, are two entirely different things, alas! And none of the above necessarily describes how a historian spends most of their days, which can vary depending on what kind of job one really has and where one has it.)",AskHistorians,0

"Could you expand further on what it means to ""minimize"" the Holocaust as a Holocaust denier? I remember seeing a political cartoon comparing the Holocaust to modern state oppression classified as being a Holocaust denier. To me, that seems to go a step too far, to making the Holocaust as some sort of Holy icon that stands above all other moments in history. If you cannot compare the Holocaust to other events, historic or current, then it loses its importance.

So could you expand on ways to compare the Holocaust to other events without minimizing it?

Edit: (adding context) The cartoon was from an Iranian contest about a decade ago, the contest was in response to a Dutch contest to draw cartoons of the prophet Mohammed. Iran held its own contest for cartoons of Holocaust denial. So the label of denier was applied by the artists themselves.

The winning cartoon depicted the Israeli army using the Holocaust to justify modern oppression. I tried to find other entries to the contest, but could not. Maybe they were too offensive for Western media, or maybe the Iranians never posted them online.",AskHistorians,0

"I think the short (or at least technical) answer is no. I don't think anyone could argue against Christianity being incredibly important, even fundamental, to the history of the Byzantine Empire, but you could argue either way as to whether it is a theocracy.

I suppose it depends what you mean by theocracy. If you mean that the state is ruled by religious figures, then no. The Emperor was the ruler of the empire, supported by a bureaucracy of civil servants and had authority over the church. However, (s)he was not a church official (bishop, patriarch etc).

If theocracy is a state ruled by the laws of a religion (or church) then definitely no. While many Byzantine laws (certainly in the later empire) were influenced by religious considerations, the majority stemmed from the secular (or even pagan) principles of the Roman Empire/Republic. The church certainly didn't have an official role in creating or enforcing civil law.

However, you could argue that Christianity was so entwined with and fundamental to the Byzantine Empire's character and history that it is a theocracy. Without their staunch Christianity, the Byzantines history with the Muslim invasions, Crusades, Iconoclasm, heresies and the church councils would read very differently, if at all.

And I suppose with that, there's a possible line of saying that the Eastern Roman Empire wasn't a theocracy but that the Byzantine Empire was. At that point, though, we're debating the point at which the Eastern side became it's own rather that just the Roman Empire (or at least part of it) and I think that's leading us away from a meaningful answer to your question.

"I'm extremely skeptical that this is true; I'm searching for supporting information on this but am not finding any references in reliable sources (in either English or Japanese).

I'm not suggesting that Ishii never proposed such a plan, but the idea put forward by the referenced TIL post and wiki article that the Japanese were actually planning to implement it in September 1945  only to be stopped by the end of the war stretches credibility to the extreme.

To see why, we only need to look at the supposed means that were going to be used to carry it out. Three I-400-class submarines had been completed by the end of the war: I-400, I-401, and I-402. But I-400 and I-401 had left Japan in late July and were near the Caroline Islands when the war ended. And I-402 had already been converted into a tanker submarine (and was undergoing repairs from an early August air raid when the war ended, in any case). There was one more under construction when the war ended (I-404), but it had been seriously damaged in an air raid in late July. In short, there were only two submarines available to carry out this operation and the Japanese had already dispatched them elsewhere.

ETA: I tracked down one of the wiki article's sources (John Geoghegan's *Operation Storm: Japan's Top Secret Submarines and Its Plan to Change the Course of World War II*), and it completely contradicts the article's contents. It gives Operation PX as the name of the operation and states that it was killed by the army in March 1945.

"The biggest problem was a lack of flexibility. The plan was detailed to individual train schedules, troop densities and scheduled lines of advance. The lack of flexibility meant that once war began the German General Staff couldn't mobilize against just Russia (although France and Russia had mutual defense pacts at the time only Russia was at war with Germany when the mobilization order was given, but the plan couldn't be altered to reflect that - to answer an imminent invasion by Russia France must be invaded), or avoid invading Belgium despite diplomatic realities. The timeline was unalterable without throwing the entire mobilization into chaos. 

Another problem was the German General Staff thoroughly underestimated the diplomatic reaction that their invasion of Belgium would cause. Many German military leaders believed that the Belgians would not contest the invasion and would allow the German Army to pass through unmolested, and that Britain wouldn't support Belgian neutrality by going to war when presented with a fait accompli of a total German victory in the west. 

In reality, the Belgians fought back and slowed the advance, the British declared war and the BEF was key in the Battle of the Marne which ended the battle of movement (i.e. the final point of failure of the Schlieffen Plan) and began the static warfare which characterized the war on the Western Front for the remainder of the war. 

So, the Schlieffen Plan was predicated on several assumptions and could not be altered or adjusted in the event. If any of these assumptions proved incorrect (in 1914 essentially all were incorrect) it risked the plan as a whole.",AskHistorians,0

"From an [earlier answer of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2s8b1n/according_to_wikipedia_ludwig_ii_of_bavarias/)

The question of Ludwig II's mental health is a very grey area with no clear answer. Ludwig II had exhibited a number of erratic and odd behavior which his deposition concluded he suffered from an advanced state of insanity which many have since construed as schizophrenia. The Third Reich would further popularize this alleged madness as the Wittelsbach were not friends of the new regime. However, the lead physician of the deposition, Bernhard von Gudden, never once consulted the actual patient. *Der Spiegel*'s article is correct in that von Gudden's report met in secret and many of its interviews were secret. It goes without saying that a deposition of a monarch is a highly politicized affair and Bismarck warned against a secret deposition that it could look like a palace coup. 

Ludwig II's instability and violent outbursts are a matter of record. There were a number eyewitnesses of him dressing as Louis XIV and or boxing the ears of servants that displeased him. Modern psychiatrists looking at the evidence collected by von Gudden tend not agree with the diagnosis of schizophrenia or extreme delusions. Förstl et. al argues on the basis of Ludwig's autopsy and the deposition evidence that Ludwig may have been schizotypal. Haffner argues that some of his eccentric behavior may have stemmed from brain injuries due to meningitis contracted as a child. Christopher McIntosh, one of Ludwig II's biographers, puts forward the theory that advanced syphilis would have explained his behavior. 

You have to keep in mind that these diagnoses are all conjecture and replicate much of the same original sin of von Gudden of relying upon hearsay evidence. Ludwig II towards the end of his life did act in an unusual manner and this behavior alienated a number of people within his household. It is impossible to say whether or not they exaggerated or told the truth during the deposition. 

It is also important to contextualize Ludwig II's castle mania with wider political developments and the new Reich Bavaria became a component of. Nineteenth-century monarchs sought legitimation through building projects and Bavaria was no exception. Ludwig II's grandfather, Ludwig I erected two quite famous neoclassical monuments, [Walhalla](http://europeforvisitors.com/germany/regensburg/walhalla.htm) and the [Befreiungshalle](http://www.schloesser.bayern.de/englisch/palace/objects/kelheim.htm). Ludwig II's castle-building was expensive and somewhat unprecedented, but it was his erratic behavior that caused concern. Prior exercises in the ""cult of monarchy"" via pageantry associated with celebrating new buildings or anniversaries of older ones were not viable when Ludwig II made himself a recluse from wider Bavarian society. Ludwig II was absent the celebrations of the Wittelsbach's 700th jubilee, leaving his uncle Prince Luitpold to chair the festivities. The King's reclusive nature, along with his erratic behavior in private, became a real problem for the Wittelsbach court because it meant the state paid an excessive amount of money for these projects without receiving any commiserate benefit. This was particularly troubling because the unification of Germany put the various German monarchs in an awkward position. They were nominally part of a federal dynastic union, but the Prussian-centric system erased much of their actual political power. Moreover, modernizing trends such as universal male suffrage and industrialization made the various princes and kings look like anachronisms. Other contemporaries of Ludwig II reacted to these developments by cultivating a common touch with their subjects and other such forms of ""bourgeois monarchy"" such as materials emphasizing the middle class domesticity of regal home life. Ludwig II's reclusiveness made such a legitimization strategy near impossible and gave impetus to deposing him. The scandals surrounding Ludwig I's mistress Lola Montez and the popular unrest against the monarchy in 1848 were still within living memory in the 1880s.  Tellingly,  Prince Luitpold as regent did cultivate a common touch such as as participation in *Oktoberfest* and wore local costume to present himself as a truly Bavarian monarch. The success of Luitpold's efforts at presenting himself as a monarch/regent of the people helped a good deal to recover the popular legitimacy of the Wittlelsbach dynasty and eased questions about Ludwig II's deposition and death.

"It's worth noting, as comes up occasionally in /r/askhistorians, that the editors writing and/or camping out on Wikipedia pages are often NOT historians, that Wikipedia does not allow original research (i.e. a historian cannot use their trained ability to interpret sources in writing a Wikipedia page; only things already claimed by already-written sources, regardless of their recency or assessment by current professional historians), and historians posting to AskHistorians have claimed it's just not worth their time getting into a war of attrition with an editor who has decided to camp out on a page, regardless of how wrong-headed that editor may be, and Wikipedia does not care if you are an expert in your field -- they only care if you can find a given claim in writing in some ostensibly-respectable source (even if it's 50 years old and long since considered disproved by professionals).

"Although Bismarck kept a revolving door of talented men as secretaries and servitors, he seldom used them for very long and discarded them when they were no longer useful or had crossed the Prince in some manner. The German diplomat Friedrich zu Limburg-Stirum likened Bismarck's use of these men with a tart analogy: 

&gt;Bismarck is to his ministers the way Don Juan was to his lovers. First he cajoles them, and when he catches them, he lets them go without caring about what happens to them.

This pattern of using and discarding men was partly a function of Bismarck's own habits of rule. As a good *Realpolitiker*, he kept many irons in the fire and pursued multiple channels of action simultaneously. This meant some men were useful one day, and then of less utility if one scheme did not pay off. The important thing to Bismarck was that he was the spider at the center of the webs he wove. In an 1885 note to Baron August von Firks-Samiten, Bismarck explained why he did not need a successor: 

&gt;As for why I have not yet provided a successor, dear Firks, that question has often been asked of me. The answer is very simple- I would have to be already dead  in my own lifetime.

For Bismarck, the system he created was indispensable without him, only he knew all the details of how it worked and functioned. Having no official successor meant he could not be dismissed summarily and made him even more essential.  Bismarck's own vanity meant he never really saw his contemporaries as equals and his acerbic qualities made him many enemies in the court and among elite circles despite his prestige as the unifier of Germany. 

There was one exception to Bismarck's utilitarian approach to his subordinates: his son Herbert. Unlike other servitors, family could not be dismissed so easily and Bismarck trusted his own blood more readily than any fellow Junker. Herbert had some aptitude for diplomacy and entered into the Foreign Ministry at a relatively early age and quickly ascended up the ladder in the agency, becoming State Secretary in 1886. There was talk within elite German circles that the elder Bismarck was grooming his son as an heir. Between 1888-89, Herbert acted as the Chancellor's personal representative besides Wilhelm II, and some of Bismarck's enemies clucked that what the father was for Wilhelm I, so Herbert would be for the great Kaiser's grandson. But Herbert by this time was something of a broken man. He had fallen deeply in love with the Princess Elisabeth von Carolath-Beuthen in the early 1880s. The Princess had two major strikes against her. First she was a divorcee ten years Herbert's senior, thus undercutting the prestige of his son. Second, and worse for the Lutheran Bismarck, the Princess was a Catholic. Bismarck threatened and cajoled his son against the match, even bringing Kaiser Wilhelm I into the fray, and Herbert acceded to his father's wishes. But the experience made Herbert cynical and encouraged his alcoholism. He served his father faithfully, but after this episode, could never step outside of his shadow, often admitting only his father knew how the system worked. Herbert could have had a vibrant career in the post-1890 political world, the Bismarck name still carried a lot of weight,  but he chose to resign along with his father. In the end, Herbert's promising career became collateral damage to his father's fall from grace.

"As a follow-up. What about Bermuda? 

Given its (relative) geographical proximity to the Carolinas, one would think that the geographical considerations of that prevented the Caribbean islands would have been essentially a non-factor. Further, what about the demographics of Bermuda? 

My understanding (which is quite tenuous) about the Bermudan situation is that they were basically politically aligned with the colonies, and were economically diversified enough that they weren't excessively benefited by the Sugar Act and similar protectionist legislations. 

One would think also, given Bermuda's reliance on American foodstuffs, that they would have starved with a de facto cessation of trade with Bermuda from the colonies and would have, if only to avoid famine or similar unrest, would have been forced into the American camp.

And when it comes to slavery, while as I understand it Bermuda was very much a slave economy in the agriculture sector, given its 'tendrils' across the Atlantic and Caribbean, the economy doesn't seem so beholden to it that the Whites-to-Slaves ratio would be favorable to the Bermudans, at least in so far as the ratio would have been no worse than places like the Carolinas or Georgia in the Americas, where they *did* join the Revolution, and further unlike Jamaica or the other Caribbean islands, had no major slave revolts that necessitated the placing of a neutralizing garrison on the island.

Thus, the question: what was it about Bermuda, specifically, that kept it from joining the revolt? Was it more Caribbean - that is, protectionist, isolated, and the slave threat such that a large (British) garrison was required - than I'm giving it credit for?

Was it that it didn't revolt because the island knew of its strategic importance in the event of a revolt on the mainland? Did it realize that it would be the first stop of the Royal Navy in order to secure a stable supply line to the Americas, especially given the Bermudan maritime tradition and its history of being a hotbed of privateering when Britain required pirates-for-hire in the region against Spain and France?  

And touching on the garrison and Royal Navy questions: given the island's importance as a naval supply point for the Atlantic and Caribbean, even discounting the slave threat, was the British military presence such that people knew there was no hope, even if they were ""merely"" protecting their military bases? 

It's not like being occupied from Day 1 in the majority or entirety (South Carolina and Georgia come to mind, if I recall) stopped them from gaining independence in the end.  Even though Bermudans knew that signing on with the colonies would mean independence as a matter of all for one and one for all, to quote Dumas, why didn't the Bermudans, who from what little I've read on it seemed to be pro-independence simply sign on with it and hope to basically wait it out for everyone else to carry them to independence? Were there plans to send a delegation that simply couldn't be sent due to Royal Navy operations, and they gave up after that point basically, or am I missing something else?",AskHistorians,0

"Like I said, I'm not an expert in this area so I can't say for sure.

My point is that it's easy to say ""Germany should have done this or that"", especially in regards to their material output, but everything they could have done would have taken from other areas. If Germany pushed more into war production, could they have kept the population complacent? Could they have maintained their grip on their conquered territories? In regards to a question about how Germany could win the war, this is important.

There's also the problem that no improvement to the supply shortage that the Germans could make would really reverse the war. It's arguable that Germany was doomed from the start, and certainly the moment they invaded the Soviet Union. They would need easily twice the supplies they had to even maintain many of their areas, like the Stalingrad pocket, and that still raises problems because the Russians were still going to massively push past all expectations and go to the limit to stop the Germans.

There's also issues like, even if the increase in supplies somehow saves the German eastern front from at least collapsing, that still leaves England, the USA and so many other areas Germany really had no hope in. ",AskHistorians,0

"Muzzle-loaders of the 18th-19th c. are muzzle-heavy, and if the buttstocks are long enough to fit a typical man's arms, they are too long for the average woman.  Most women today find the modern reproductions of these very awkward to hold and aim. What about surviving guns from the period?
The survival rate for American guns , rifles from the 18th c.,  is rather low: they mostly got worn out. However , later ones, muzzle-loaders circa 1820-1860 had only a few decades of use before they were made obsolete by breech-loading cartridge guns, and a good number of those do survive. Among them are indeed found some lighter pieces with shorter buttstocks. These have sometimes been called boy's rifles, but given the fact that a rifle was not cheap and that a boy would soon grow too big to use a small one, it's most likely that they were made for women, and now they're usually called ladies' rifles.  I doubt anyone has ever done some sort of survey to come up with a percentage,  to say if the average woman would own one, but it's pretty safe to say that the average surviving period rifle is more often sized to fit an average man.  This is different from saying whether the average woman on the frontier c. 1820-1860 would be ABLE to load and shoot a gun if required, of course- but if she was average-sized, she'd be looking for something to rest it on.

Looking around online for an example of a ladies' rifle, I have only found [this](http://ehcnc.org/decorative-arts/historic-trades/the-kentucky-rifle/) .  If you scroll far down to Fig 69, the Cofer rifle is a good- though overly fancy- example.",AskHistorians,0

"There are lots of dimensions to this question. Firstly, there's the simple fact that Stalin was not very interested in spreading world revolution because of the principle of Socialism in One Country. The failures of communist revolutions across Europe between 1917-1922 convinced Stalin of the futility of aiding in the subversion of European states towards communism. Stalin felt that it was more beneficial/sensible to construct socialism within the Soviet Union and shore up its own defenses against perceived aggression from capitalist powers. 

Stalin's army was also not nearly as well-equipped as Hitler's or Mussolini's and therefore the assistance that Stalin could offer the Spanish Republic was limited. There were also additional diplomatic concerns- if Stalin offered overt military aid to Spain, this would anger the Western powers who, while not fans of Hitler, were equally distrustful of Stalin. Stalin understood that victory against Franco would need the help of Western allies like France and Britain. If he overplayed his hand in Spain, he risked alienating them. Conversely, he also had to worry that if he showed too much support for the Republic, Germany might also be compelled to invade the Soviet Union. Germany had signed the ""Anti-Comintern Pact"" with Japan and a number of European states, which sent a strong message to the Soviets that Hitler was prepared to undermine the Soviet regime by military efforts if necessary (which, as we know, he eventually did). 

I think that we have to realize that Stalin had a myriad of priorities within the Soviet Union that prevented him from throwing full support behind the Republic. He was concerned about the preservation of his own regime and state, and to that end he felt that an excessive entanglement in foreign affairs could risk making too many enemies that might seek to undermine the Soviet Union. As long as he kept out of their affairs, or, as long as he offered limited support, he felt that he was playing enough of a diplomatic game of chess to keep different European powers satisfied.

"I can answer that one a little bit, at least for parts of Europe (mostly Britain). Coinage across Europe was influenced by the coinage of big empires. The earliest Gallic and Britannic coins we have found are traceable in form to the coinage (namely the gold *stater*) of Macedonia under Philip of Macedon (359-336 BC). On one side of these coins, there was the head of Apollo, on the reverse was a two horse chariot. Interpretations of this coin design persisted up to the Roman invasions of Britain and Gaul, when British coinage begins to incorporate Roman elements and imagery, namely signifying titles like *rex* (lit. *king*), as well as the names of rulers, and Gallic coinage is largely replaced by Roman money. 

**TL;DR large groups of Celts, especially in Gaul and subsequently Britain, adopted round coinage with heads on one side from Macedonian designs, and this was only reinforced by Roman styles in the 1st century BC.**

"The term ""The Holocaust"" in its most common usage in popular culture and academia is generally understood and defined as the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews and up to half a million Roma, Sinti, and other groups persecuted as ""gypsies"" by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. During the time of the Holocaust the Nazis also targeted other groups on grounds of their perceived ""inferiority"", such as the disabled and Slavs, and on grounds of their religion, ideology or behavior among them Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses and homosexuals.

The focus of this definition on Jews and more recently so-called gypsies as well as the common association of the term Holocaust with the murder of six million Jews in Europe results from the difference in persecutorial practice and the totality of the planned annihilation of the Jews by the Nazis.

It was the Nazis' plan and policy to kill every Jew and every ""gypsy"" they could get their hands on, regardless of who they were, what they did, their gender, age, nationality, class or political conviction. They built an entire administration, bureaucracy, and infrastructure to that specific end and used all the tools the modern state has at its disposal from the rail way to the army in order to achieve this goal. What the Nazis referred to as the ""final solution to the Jewish question"" was genocide in its most encompassing and most extreme form.

The Nazi regime subjected millions of people to violence, starvation, exploitation of labor, imprisonment, and murder but no other group was targeted so systematically and with such totality than the Jews and ""gypsies"". These key differences become apparent when we look at how this was put in practice. While the Nazis did indeed start killing handicapped and disabled Germans before they started killing Jews, they did not pressure foreign governments to hand over their handicapped for example as they did with Jews. The fact that the Nazi government exerted diplomatic pressure on the Imperial Japanese government to hand over the 18.000 Jews in Shanghai demonstrates that for the Nazis even a comparatively small number of Jews thousands of miles away from any of their territory represented such a danger to them in their minds that they had to die.

Similarly, the Nazi regime imprisoned and shot thousands upon thousands of Soviet and Polish citizens, yet they never built camps that only existed with the sole purpose of murdering all Poles or Soviets they could get their hands on like they did with Jews. Camps such as Sobibor, Treblinka and Belzec were nothing but a modicum of infrastructure surrounding a gas chamber. In Treblinka, a camp barely the size of two soccer fields, up to 900.000 Jews were murdered in the span of a year.

This all does in no way minimize or trivialize the horrors and cruelty of how the Nazis treated their non-Jewish victims. Soviets and Poles, handicapped and mentally ill people, Communists and Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses and homosexuals, all suffered tremendously under the Nazis and unimaginable numbers of them were killed. They all need to be remembered.

Yet, when we describe what the Nazis termed the ""final solution"" some structural and ideological differences become apparent. I have previously mentioned death camps and diplomatic pressure but another example would be that the Nazis indeed did try to kill every Jew, including babies and children. Even within the gruesome and savage history of Nazi atrocities against so many people, the description of SS troops invading a hospital and killing Jewish babies by smashing their heads against walls or setting up a whole state apparatus concerned with the systmeatic gassing and shooting of men, women, children, and the elderly evokes a special kind of terror and revulsion.

The term Holocaust is in the historical field first and foremost intended as a term that acknowledges and contains the description of this difference, without attempting to moralize this difference or make any sort of statement, which was ""worse"", because when you deal in the category of Nazi atrocities against all its victims ""worse"" is not really a category that can cover it anymore.

That the term has become so ingrained within popular memory and culture and that popular memory and culture associate the Nazi regime with its murder of Europe's Jews (and sometimes tends to forget about the other victims of Nazi murder and oppression) has to do with the fact that the genocide against the Jews challenged the Western Meta-Narrative of History. As /u/agentdcf describes [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4tln3x/steve_king_the_contributions_of_western_civ/d5ibayl):

&gt; the Holocaust (...) struck right at the heart of the narrative of Western Civilization. See, the narrative imagines the West to be uniquely rational, scientific, prosperous, inventive--in short, active and progressive. It posits that the West has been the driving force of capital-H History. The Nazis are The Problem for the Western Civilization narrative because they used so many of the elements of the West that its proponents saw as good, but in ways that were so obviously terrible: democracy, since Hitler and the National Socialists came to power at least partly through elections; science, as the Nazis built a foundation of what we now call pseudo-science but that was really the culmination of 19th-century scientific racism, in order to marginalize, attack, and attempt to utterly destroy specific groups of people in Europe, in the West (this sort of thing had happened before in imperial encounters but could be excused as occurring against non-Western Others); industrial technology, as the Holocaust itself used essentially factory methods. How, then, could the West be the home of a civilization that should be the best for everyone, when it created the worst as well?

In short the Western imagination of itself had experienced atrocities and horrors inflicted against political opponents, ""deviants"", and colonial subjects but it had never experienced that all it used to define itself as good and progressive – the modern state and its bureaucracy, industry, science, the police – was used to murder an entire group of European peoples. This is why, the originally descriptive term of Holocaust has turned into a symbolic and signifying term and why, when we hear Nazi atrocities, we tend to immediately think of the murder of six million Jews.",AskHistorians,0

How comfortable are historians at assigning personalities to historical figures prior to all the first-hand documentations of the 20th century?

Is there a way to tell what descriptions of personality is real and what is propaganda from chroniclers a long time ago? Could some actions be thought of as irrationally aggressive from someone easy to anger, while inactions be though of by weak and indecisive people? Or should historians just focus on recorded and confirmed events and actions and forget personality?

Related, should actions by historical characters always be thought of as rational or at least justified from a certain of view, or should we consider decisions being made a certain day just because the person was having a good/bad day due to the weather.",AskHistorians,0

"It actually played a major role, if not the defining factor, in Hitler's life. It was after all in Vienna that he first encountered Jews in a proper sense (I say this because I can't recall if he ever saw them in Linz), and noted in *Mein Kampf* this: the chance meeting where he met a Jewish man and his first thought was: ""Is this a Jew?"" which morphed into the idea of ""Is this a German?""

Stalin was only in Vienna a short while, and had grown up in multi-ethnic Tbilisi, which while in Georgia was governed by Russians and dominated by Armenian business. He had also spent more time in the oil-boom cities of Baku and Batumi, which were melting pots of foreign labourers (a lot of Persians in the former, Turks in the latter, as well as various Europeans and peoples from across the Russian Empire and Middle East). The effect this had on him is not something I believe has ever really been studied, though Stalin's worldliness gave him a certain credibility amongst the Bolsheviks as an ""expert"" on nationality, so much that Lenin asked him to write the 1913 essay ""Marxism and the Nationality Question,"" which came to dominate Bolshevik nationality policy for decades (Lenin by contrast, despite his years in exile, was never that in touch with national minorities, despite writing about them on occasion).",AskHistorians,0
"Cliometrics for the win!

Your analysis is very illuminating.

The difference between 35 men per 1000 koku and 60 men per 1000 koku is pretty substantial.  Any idea what the shape of the distribution was?

On the 30 Years War, most combatants army sizes varied greatly over the course of the conflict.  Wallenstien famously was able to ""field"" an army of nearly 230,000 men in 1631, but a in reality he was never able to bring more than about 100,00 effectives into combat at any one time.  The technology and social organization of the era meant that logistical requirements tended to increase logarithmically above a certain size.  An army of 50,000 could forage and be resupplied by a relatively manageable supply train, while an army of 100,000 men needed a logistical train nearly as large again as itself just to keep the people at the front fed and the horses supplied with fodder.

"Right. But you also have to remember, we're talking about a world where most people don't live in cities, where automobiles and aircraft don't exist, where telephones don't exist, etc. A lot of the people you interact with are going to be people you already know and people who live nearby. People aren't going to get coffee because that's just not a thing that is possible, instead people are going to come visit and share a meal, for example. Now, this gets more complicated when you get into the modern age where people still might have some aspects of polychronic time due to their culture but live in industrialized settings. In Hawaii, for example, people go out of their way to indicate what variety of appointment they're making with people, whether it's a monochronic time appointment (so-called ""haole time"") or a polychronic time appointment (""hawaiian time""). In a lot of the developing world most of the locals still adhere to a polychronic notion of time (for cultural reasons) which can often make them seem intensely flaky when monochronic folks interact with them (and, indeed, this can have some severe consequences if you call to schedule a cab to pick you up for a drive to the airport and they show up extremely late).",AskHistorians,0

"Baby boomer just describes the demographic of people who all had children at the same time (ie, after returning from WWII), and who had more children than their own parents because the sudden economic boom allowed them to support more children than previous generations. It has nothing to do with them being more ""straight"" than previous generations, it was just a matter of timing and money leading to lots of people having lots of kids simultaneously.

And I don't see why anyone would think straight men are more likely to be casualties during WWII than gay men. While technically being known to be gay was grounds for kicking someone out of the armed forces at the time, those rules were [**ignored or effectively suspended**](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/5/25/1094817/-Remembering-LGBT-History-How-World-War-II-Changed-Gay-and-Lesbian-Life-in-America) for the duration of WWII because of the desperate need for manpower.

"Christopher Matthews is a bit of a non-traditionalist who utilises ""physical re-creation, experimental archaeology, and ballistics testing"" to reconstruct the physical mechanics of phalanx combat. He works not far from where I study and has also taught at my University, though unfortunately I've never met him. He's a highly educated re-enactor with an obsession with something that can never be decisively determined, but as traditional classicists who focus on the literary sources to re-create ancient battles (like me!) are a dime-a-dozen, his approach is potentially very useful and worthy of consideration. He has multiple publications and is currently employed as an academic with a very specialist bent so I'd say his fairly qualified to put forward his somewhat controversial opinions (controversial as much due to his non-traditional method as anything else). I'm always skeptical of re-enactors and war-gamers (even though tabletop war-gaming is awesome), but this guy seems to be the real deal.

His work on the Hellenistic phalanx is clearly an extension of his previous work on the Greek phalanx. His book on the mechanics of Greek phalanx fighting in a previous work (Storm of Spears 2012) was reviewed positively by a fairly well-respected military classicist, Rosemary Sheldon, in 2014. She didn't necessarily say he was right on everything, but that he gives a fresh perspective that is worth consideration. She's quite a technical military historian herself so if she thinks it's worth a look then it probably is.

I haven't read this book and I didn't know it existed but I have to say that from what I'm reading right now, in my opinion (and /u/iphikrates who may have read Storm of Spears might be able to give a more nuanced view) it's worth a read, along with other views on phalanx warfare such as one might find in ""Greek Warfare: Myths and Realities"" (van Wees 2004) or ""Men of Bronze"" (Kagan &amp; Viggiano 2015). I can't comment intelligently on the state of the *othismos* debate (whether or not hoplites literally shoved each other en-masse like a footy scrum), but I can fairly confidently say that this book would be worth a look and I've just added it to my Book Depository wishlist (it's 54% off!).",AskHistorians,0

"I'm uncertain, and here's why.

The process of armistice was initiated by the Germans, not the Allies. 

&gt;The possibility of an armistice had begun the evening of November 7 when French soldiers of the 171st Régiment d’Infanterie near Haudroy were startled by an unfamiliar bugle call. Fearing they were about to be overrun, they cautiously advanced toward the increasingly loud blaring when out of the mantle of fog three automobiles emerged, their sides gilded with the imperial German eagle. The astonished Frenchmen had encountered a German armistice delegation headed by a rotund forty-three-year-old politician and peace advocate named Matthias Erzberger. The delegation was escorted to the Compigne Forest near Paris where, in a railroad dining car converted into a conference room, they were met by a small, erect figure – Marshal Foch.

Marshall Ferdinand Foch(why don't we name our kids Ferdinand anymore? They do such wonderful things when they're named Ferdinand!) was the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe during 1918, and gave the German delegation a list of his terms for the German surrender. At this point in the war, the Germans were retreating, and being pursued by the Allies, so Foch was well placed to dictate terms. When Foch had provided his terms for an armistice, he gave the German delegation 72 hours to ""obtain the consent of his government to the Allies’ terms, or the war would go on.""

The German delegation was encountered on the evening of the 7th November, and [the source](http://www.historynet.com/world-war-i-wasted-lives-on-armistice-day.htm) says that the armistice was to take effect within the deadline offered by Foch. It's not clear in the article how this works mathematically, but I think that the the initial meeting between Foch and the Germans occurred the next morning at 11am on the 8th November, and that the 72 hour/3 day deadline provided by Foch was to end on the at 11am on Nov 11. 

That way, the armistice was signed at 5am on Nov 11, 6 hours before Europe would have been plunged into war again.

"Short answer is ""yes"", Prussia was a member of the Holy Roman Empire until its demise under Napoleon. 

More detailed answer: The kingdom of Prussia was a collection of territories ruled by the Hohenzollern monarchy. This state had areas that were part of the HRE and areas that were not. The historical kernel of Prussia was the Mark Brandenburg with its capital at Berlin. Brandenburg was a part of the HRE, and the ruler of Brandenburg (who were the eventual Kings in/of Prussia) was an Imperial Elector, meaning they were one step below the Emperor. As the Hohenzollerns monarchy expanded, they came into control of areas to the east of Brandenburg, including ducal and royal Prussia (areas that were part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), that were not part of the Holy Roman Empire. They also expanded westwards and picked up lots of territory along the Rhine river in the western part of German speaking Central Europe. [Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Map_of_the_Holy_Roman_Empire%2C_1789_en.png) is a nice map of the HRE from just before the outbreak of the French Revolution. You'll see in the upper right that there are portions of the Kingdom of Prussia outside the borders of the HRE, yet the large blue area shaded in the upper right, labeled the Electorate of Brandenburg inside the borders. Over on the left side, you'll see other blue shaded areas near the border with the Netherlands (see for example the area labeled *Hzm Kleve*). All of those areas are part of the same state ruled by the Hohenszollerns and which historians refer to as the Kingdom of Prussia. ",AskHistorians,0

&gt;Since the bridge was completed in 1883, the idea of illegally selling it has become the ultimate example of the power of persuasion. A good salesman could sell it, a great swindler would sell it, and the perfect sucker would fall for the scam.

""Several times,"" Mr. Sifakis wrote, ""Parker's victims had to be rousted from the bridge by police when they tried to erect toll barriers.""

&gt;Another seller was William McCloundy, also known as ""I.O.U. O'Brien,"" who sold the bridge in 1901, ""for which he was convicted of grand larceny and served two and a half years in Sing Sing,"" The New York Times wrote some years later.",AskHistorians,0

'Tigers' is a bit vague, but your quote is talking about an entire year prior to the events of Fury. And we're talking about a tank which was notorious for being under supplied to keep fielded.

Tiger 1's were exceedingly rare for the Americans to encounter. Zaloga only found 2 or 3 verified- that is, American after action reports that agree with other evidence that Tiger 1's were found and fought, as opposed to anecdotes- instances where they encountered them- remember, German heavy armor wasn't concentrated in American sectors in France- and one of them involved a Tiger sitting on it's train car.

"This is exactly the sub for this kind of thing. Welcome. :)

Slavery was, in fact, the issue. Unless we read the other things often cited superficially, to the point of basically not reading them at all, they are all directly and clearly concerning slavery. (They also tend to evaporate, when not simply invented whole cloth by latter-day apologists, the moment slavery isn't at issue.) Nor does the history of sectional tension support any other thesis nearly so completely or convincingly. In the end, you still end up with a division of the slave states and the free states. If the matter under contention was not slavery, then that alignment is wildly improbable. Neither the free nor slave states are so uniform that you would expect it them to line up so consistently otherwise. 

Note, however, that while the cause of the Confederacy is slavery's preservation and advance, it's not necessarily so that this motivated a majority (or even close to one) of Americans committed to ending the slaveholder's insurrection. As is usually the case in the nineteenth century, the South has considerably more sectional cohesion around proslavery politics than the North does around antislavery.

That said, this is my area study. I wrote [a brief summary of past posts on the subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5799wo/was_the_civil_war_about_states_rights_more_so/d8qm6yz) a few days back which I'll rerun here:

&gt; The short version is that there are two sovereign rights of the states which the slave states where keen on: 1) The absolute right to hold slaves in perpetuity themselves. 2) The right to suppress any antislavery movements or legislation that come out of the free states, generally through the force of the federal government.

"The full name of the Scipio Africanus that beat Hannibal at Zama (202 BC) was Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, and he is never referred to as ""Cornelius Africanus"" but rather ""Scipio Africanus"". His father had the same name, minus the ""Africanus"". It was Africanus' defeat of Hannibal that earned him the *agnomen* Africanus. As per Roman naming conventions, an agnomen could be passed on to one's heir. So Scipio Africanus that beat Hannibal had a son with precisely the same name, who unfortunately died of illness and never had children. 

However, another Roman of a similar name, usually referred to ""Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus"", was born of another family, the Aemilii, but was adopted by the son of Africanus who died young, hence the cognomen denoting his original family. People often get confused here because Aemilianus, before being adopted by the Scipios, was the nephew of Africanus' wife: that is to say, he was born with a different name as the son of Scipio's wife's brother, who was also a famous general (Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus who knocked the Macedonians over in 168 BC). Scipio Aemilianus was the man who finally destroyed Carthage in 146 BC, establishing his own claim to the agnomen ""Africanus"". He actually ended up with several cognomen/agnomen, but once he was adopted he could technically have been called Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus (among a few other options, 'Aemilianus' probably being more helpful) but suffice to say his name was Publius Cornelius Scipio and one of his agnomen was Africanus. So you can see how flexible (and confusing) these naming conventions are.

There are two options for what your history teacher is talking about. He could be referring to is Publius Cornelius Scipio who died fighting the Carthaginians in Spain in 211 BC, and his son, the famous Publius Cornelius Scipio later named ""Africanus"". However the father was never named ""Africanus"". So he may have been talking about the Publius Cornelius Scipio *Africanus*, the famous one, and either his son who died young or the Scipio Aemilianus his son adopted and who therefore had claim to the the name Africanus himself. Scipio Aemilianus, famous, longer-lived and later referred to as Africanus (among other names) due to his exploits, was also later referred to as *Scipio Africanus Minor* to differentiate him from his adoptive grandfather, the original Scipio Africanus. I assume this is what your teacher means, but basically your teacher is a bit confused. And who claim blame him?

**To answer your question in the title though, there was only one Scipio Africanus in the Second Punic War: the one that beat Hannibal. There was however an adopted Scipio Africanus in the Third Punic War. So you might say there were two Scipio Africanus' in the Punic Wars. They were not father and son however.** Scipio Aemilianus only really earned the name Africanus himself when he sacked Carthage, which thereby ended the Third and final Punic War, but he had the name nonetheless. The former was the latter's adoptive grandfather, not his father. There were, however, two Publius Cornelius Scipio's in the Second Punic War: the father who died in 211 BC, and the son who became the (main) famous Africanus.

"I'm looking for a reliable commentary or source on exactly that (cold-weather footwear, if any).  Haven't found one yet.  Mackenzie talks about a ""clumsy sandal"" worn by a (low-status) moTswana companion in passing, compared to his finer footwear (p.208), almost as though we're supposed to just know what that is. It's weird that it doesn't seem to figure anywhere, but I will keep my eyes open.

[edit: got a nibble, sort of. [Thomas Morgan Thomas, of the London Missionary Society, was just north of the Limpopo among the Khumalo Ndebele nation of Mzilikazi from 1859-1870](https://books.google.com/books?id=_AFWAAAAcAAJ).  As the amaKhumalo considered themselves ""Zulu"" despite their flight from Shaka, and the origin of this nation involved an accretive swath from kwaZulu through the central Highveld all the way north from 1822 on, it may be of help to know the practices.  Thomas references sandal-making as being important, and the ""native sandal"" as having a sole of animal leather--though he frustratingly doesn't describe them in detail!  There is a ""traditional"" Zulu sandal--if you look it up, pictures of the current iteration abound--and the word *imbadada* (pl. izimbadada) for them appears in dictionaries going back to the late 1870s.  Nevertheless, the sandals aren't shown in drawings of combat situations, hunts, dances, or other assembly or formal events, which may indicate that wearing them was a very situational matter. In any case, it's not insulating footwear aside from its relation to the ground itself.]",AskHistorians,0

As for why someone might say the US was established in 1775, I suppose there are a couple of good reasons. The most obvious is that armed rebellion/resistance first broke out on April 19, 1775, with the Battles of Lexington and Concord (this is the time of the famous ""one if by night, two if by sea,"" and Paul Revere's Ride). The second is that the Second Continental Congress convened on May 10, soon after the battle.

"It's complicated. From ""Arabic Avant La Lettre. Divine, Prophetic and Heroic Arabic"" in *Approaches to Arabic Linguistics* by Stefan Wild:

&gt; With the Qurān , the mantic voice behind the voice of the Prophet
Muhammad became in the believer’s ear the voice of the one and only
God . Muslim dogma and the consensus of the unlearned considered
the Qurān to be the direct, undiluted Arabic word of God.

...

&gt; the Qurān seems indifferent to the linguistic
shape of preceding revelations . In the Qurān, the only language used is
Arabic . Arabic is also the only language mentioned by name. The Qurān
does not specify in which languages Nūh , Ibrāhīm , Ismāīl , Mūsā , Īsā or
other prophets and messengers spoke to their peoples or in which languages
their holy books might have been.

&gt; God speaks Arabic to Adam and his wife, Satan whispers in Arabic
(Sura 20:120), the angels and the jinn speak Arabic (Sura 72:1–15),
Moses addresses the Pharaoh , Joseph addresses the Egyptian minister’s
wife in Arabic, Jesus speaks Arabic from his cradle, Dū l-Qarnayn and
the People of the Cave —they all use Arabic. Every single soul is made to
speak Arabic at the Day of Judgment , animals like the ant (Sura 27:18) or
the hoopoe (Sura 27:22), even inanimate entities like Hell (Sura 50:30)
speak Arabic. Everybody and everything that speaks in the Qurān must
necessarily speak Arabic, because Arabic is the only language used
throughout the Qurān.

&gt; But the intention of the text is in no way to convey that all mankind
throughout history shared and will share the same language. I do not
know of any exegete who concluded from the Qurānic accounts that
the language used between Mūsā and the Egyptian Pharaoh was Arabic
or that the language used between the Egyptian notable’s wife and her
lady-friends must have been Arabic, or that the Messiah spoke in Arabic—just
because the Qurān reproduces their words in Arabic. It is a
different matter for Adam and Ismāīl (see below).

Most directly to your point:

&gt; A second important element in the Qurānic linguistic outlook flows
forth from this esteem of other languages. In the course of history, God
sent each messenger (rasūl ) to a specific people (qawm), and this messenger
brought the divine message to that people in its language.

&gt; *""And We have sent no messenger save with the tongue of his people that he
might make all clear to them
wa-mā arsalnā min rasūlin illā bi-lisāni qawmihī li-yubayyina lahum*
(Sura 14:4).

&gt; The primary raison d’être of the Qurān is that the Prophet Muhammad ’s
message was in Arabic . Whereas the other prophets and messengers had
been sent earlier with a message in the languages of their peoples, who
did not speak Arabic, Muhammad is sent to the Arabs . The Arabic language
vouchsafes the understanding of the Arabic-speaking audience.
For a great part of the Qurān, the fact that this revelation was in Arabic
was the most important difference between Muslim revelation and all
previous revelation.

&gt; These Qurānic elements influenced a theological-linguistic scenario
that gave rise to a particular image of linguistic history . The claim that Arabic as the language of the Qurān had become a divine language,
led to the construction of a religious pre-history of Arabic.

...

&gt; The basic divide between Arab philosophers and theologians concerned
with the origin of language was whether it rested on human convention
(ist ilāh   , tawādu) or on a divine act of revelation (ilhām , wahy , tawqīf ).3
The Platonic controversy whether human language was what it was physei
or thesei, by nature or by imposition, here took a new form. A further
problem was whether, theologically speaking, Arabic had a special linguistic
status that set it apart from all other languages.

&gt; An important part of tradition seems to be in general agreement that
Adam , who is in Islam a prophet, was the first human being to speak Arabic
. The ‘revelationists ’ based their view mainly on the early exegesis of
Qurān 2:31 wa-allama Ādama l-asmāa kullahā “and He (God ) taught
Adam all names.” Weiss explains: ‘According to at-T abarī , the majority
of early exegetes , including the noted Companion and tafsīr -authority
Ibn Abbās , interpreted this verse as meaning that God taught Adam the
Arabic names of all existing things. This meant that Adam’s language
was revealed by divine teaching. It also clearly implied that God taught
Adam language in its entirety.4
 According to Ibn Jinnī (d. 392/1002),
most Mutazilites , on the other hand, taught that all languages including
Arabic rested on convention, not on revelation .5

&gt; The most widely accepted historical model that explained the existence
of languages other than Arabic was built on the supposition that
Arabic had been at a certain time the universal language. The idea of
a universal common language can also be found in Gen 11:1, where,
however, this language does not have a name. For most Arabic scholars ,
Arabic was the earliest existing language.8
 But this universality had at
some point in history come to an end, and decadence, corruption, and
confusion (fasād , tahrīf, tabalbul) had set in. This statement was hard
to reconcile with the Qurānic assertion that God himself had created
the variety of human languages (Sura 30:22). The reason for the development
of other languages was nevertheless frequently seen either in
a divine act of punishing Adam or mankind, or in a general confusion
(balbala ), which ‘mixed up’ what had been one common human language
in a gradual process of ‘corruption’ (tahrīf ). Tahrīf and tabalbul
were sometimes expressly linked to a punitive act of God, sometimes
they seem to be seen more as a general tendency of history. According
to Ibn Asākir ’s chronicle, Arabic was Adam’s language in Paradise until
he disobeyed God. Then God deprived him of Arabic and he started
speaking Syriac , evidently considered a lesser language or a corrupted
form of Arabic. When Adam repented, however, God gave the Arabic
language back to him.9

So yes, forgive me for summarizing some of that with the idea that ""God speaks Arabic"" ([which is not a phrase I invented](https://books.google.ae/books?id=E673AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=god+speaks+arabic+gellner&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3mbGwgOTPAhXDOo8KHUk5CuoQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=god%20speaks%20arabic%20gellner&amp;f=false), and which passage captures the spirit of what I was trying to get across more so than holding me to the declarative statement itself), but Arabic is decidedly not merely the language of Muhammad and his people in a particular historical time period which then happened to produce the perfect record of God's speech in the form of the Qur'an.",AskHistorians,0

"I heard pretty much this type of comment very frequently back in the 1972 - 1974 timeframe.  Today I still encounter people who think that Nixon was unfairly railroaded.

This is anecdotal, but I remember the Watergate era very well (better than I can remember what happened last week, sometimes!).  But at that time, there was a cultural war going on between the pro-establishment public (those whom Nixon called ""The Silent Majority"") and the emerging youth/counterculture (championed by George McGovern in 1972).  

There was massive civil unrest in the US unlike anything the country had seen since the Civil War.  The Kennedys and M.L. King had been killed, and the majority of Americans thought these were the acts of political conspiracies.  Riots and protests were common.  The 1968 Democratic Convention was marred by bloodshed committed by the Chicago police against primarily youthful protestors.  There was a million-person protest in Washington DC (the ""War Moratorium"") that practically shut the city down.  There were countless bombings, active domestic terror cells, and even a rash of airplane hijackings.  US soldiers had committed unspeakable atrocities in Vietnam (Mai Lai, etc.).  Unarmed college students were shot by the National Guard at Kent State (which Neil Young sang about, at about the same time period he sang about Alabama in ""Southern Man"").

Many conservative people, took the attitude of something like, ""my country - right or wrong"".  These were the people who were proud of the US victory in World War II (and, they thought, Korea).  There was a strong sense of 'realpolitik' regarding the ability or necessity of the Government to do unpleasant/dirty deeds in order to maintain order in society.  The Watergate burglary had been made public a couple of months prior to the 1972 Presidential election, and yet Nixon won in an overwhelming landslide over McGovern (taking 49 out of 50 states), and by proxy, the entire counter-culture movement.  So there was a very strong backlash against the counter-culture movement.  And many, maybe most, Americans were not very worried about a little burglary when faced with impending anarchy.

Also, that was the time when Nixon masterminded the ""southern strategy"" whereby the Republican Party took the Southern states away from the Democrats.  Ever since the Civil War, the South firmly supported the Democratic party.  After the Civil Rights movement, and following the resurgent 'conservative' movement led at first by Barry Goldwater (followed by Nixon and then Reagan), the White South started backing Nixon and the Republicans.  Lynyrd Skynyrd's lyrics reflect this attitude.

I believe the tide against Nixon turned during the televised Watergate hearings.  On a daily basis, people were finding out that nearly all of Nixon's staff were, indeed, 'crooks' and many of them were packed off to jail.  And, when the transcripts of Nixon's Whitehouse tapes was released, people for the first time were exposed to the private Nixon.  The private Nixon was a foul-mouthed Machiavellian racist, as is evidenced by what the tapes revealed.   That was when, in 1974, even avid Republicans turned against Nixon, and his own party voted with the Democrats to impeach him.",AskHistorians,0

"Not all of them, no. The 37th Congress contained delegates from several of the seceded states, including two from Louisiana, three from Virginia, and five from Tennessee. Most of the seats were vacant, however, and among the Confederate states only Virginia and Tennessee (until 1862) had any senators in office. 

The members of the 36th and 37th Congresses representing states that seceded withdrew from Congress at different times. As an example, Mississippi seceded on January 9, 1861, but most of its Congressmen served until January 12, and Jefferson Davis did not withdraw until January 21. Some stayed through spring. 

Senators of the 37th Congress who supported secession were expelled from Congress. [For example, Senator Wigfall of Texas](http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=W000447) withdrew on March 23, but was (among others) formally expelled on July 11, 1861.

"In the Sengoku at least, it's considered rude to address someone by their *imina*. You address them by their title, such as Lord of Mikawa, Court Minister, etc. But if you are close enough to the person you could address him by his *Yōmyō*. Official records of the Kyoto court would often add the *honsei* at the very beginning. That is the original clan, ie the Minamoto, Taira, Fujiwara, etc. As opposed to the *myōji* which is your clan that was an offshoot of those ancient families.

This is reflected in the communications. *imina* could be used by the person signing off, but usually only when using their full three-or-four set names. Often *myōji* and title is used to sign off, sometimes *yōmyō* too. Similarly, when addressing, we find letters usually using title, but sometimes *yōmyō*.

Just quickly scanning through the first few pages of the *信長公記* (Chronicles of Oda Nobunaga), the chronicler also seem to have used the same rules. Usually people are referred to by his *myōji*-title, or *myōji*-*yōmyō* for those too young, or *myōji*-title-*imina*/*myōji*-*yōmyō*-*imina*

So you don't really ""change"" your *yōmyō*, you just stop using it officially, but only with people close to you.

If you don't use his new *myōji* and title though, it means you don't recognize his claim. If you continued to call Uesugi Masatora as Nagao Kagetora, it means you don't recognize his position of *Kantō Kanrei*, which he got by getting adopted into the Uesugi clan. If you continued to address Tokugawa Ieyasu as Matsudaira Motoyasu/Ieyasu, then it means you don't recognize his claim as *Mikawanokami*, which he justified by reviving a dead ancestral main clan (assuming he didn't make it up) and adopting himself into it.",AskHistorians,0

[Map of Sulawesi.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Sulawesi_map.PNG) Confusingly South Sulawesi refers specifically to the south*west* peninsula and some adjacent areas. The city marked 'Makassar' there was the capital of 17th-century Gowa, while major [Bugis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugis) kingdoms are more east. 

My main sources for this are works by Leonard Andaya: specifically the recent(ish) ""Nature of War and Peace among the Bugis-Makassar People,"" but also his regrettably extremely dated article ""Treaty conceptions and misconceptions: a case study from South Sulawesi."" The sad thing about Southeast Asian scholarship (especially in English) is that there are so few academic sources that you end up having to rely on dated ones. As far as I know the most comprehensive Western-language source of the Java War remains a six-book series in Dutch written around 1900...

# War in South Sulawesi

For there to be peace, there must be war. So I'll spend quite a lot of the first part of this comment talking about the perception of war.

The peoples of South Sulawesi (the Bugis and the Makassarese) have been famed and feared for their martial prowess throughout the lands below the winds, as some call the Southeast Asian archipelago. The Dutch called the powerful Makassarese empire of Gowa ""the fighting cock of the east,"" while Bugis adventurers founded a royal dynasty in Aceh, 3,000 kilometers northwest of Bugis country. And when a Malay storyteller needs to show how great his hero is, he has the hero fight and defeat - of course - the peoples of South Sulawesi.^1

The Bugis and Makassarese themselves would probably have agreed. Warfare was a recurring event in South Sulawesi, and accordingly the region was quite militarized. Warfare had popular resonance, which is reflected in war songs (*osong*):

&gt; Sway, sway with the weapons, the clothing of the brave,

&gt; Let them shine, let them shine, 

&gt; There beyond the endless mountain chains 

&gt; On the marketplace of shields,

&gt; On the battlefield,

&gt; Where heroes like courageous fighting cocks clash.

But war in South Sulawesi was not simply fighting between men for practical reasons. Elite warriors (*pabbarani*) were so venerated that they were believed to have ""white blood,"" a marker of divine descent.^2 It was also an opportunity for the relationship between the ruler and the ruled to be renewed through the oath of loyalty (*mangngaruq*), an oath that gave courage to the troops in the face of death. From a Bugis chronicle:

&gt; [The king, seeing his troops flee, said] ""Are you not ashamed, my intrepid warriors, that you have let yourselves be put to flight? Do you not recall the unwavering oath and overstated words you uttered?""

&gt; Shame [the warriors] felt in their hearts, as they recalled the unwavering oath and overstated words which they uttered. They all wished to give their lives for the land of their birth. Together they attacked the [enemy] troops...

War among the Bugis and the Makassarese was also a war of supernatural forces. Banners and drums or the sacred weapons in a kingdom's palladium were all imbued with spiritual significance.^3 Troops meditated and studied magic before fighting, fortresses incorporated graveyards and sacred sites, and during a war against the Dutch in 1859, a Bugis leader called upon 40 organ-eating demons. 

But what was the purpose of wars? There were wars of conquest, to be sure, but they did not involve creating a uniform administration. In Gowa's wars of expansion, the vanquished accepted Gowa's authority but retained their independence. Heck, even an alliance specifically created to defeat Gowa was allowed to function under Gowa hegemony! In South Sulawesi, kingdoms were conceived as people and interstate relations as relationships between individual humans (family relationships or a master-slave relationship). Wars were events by which a state could improve its position in the interstate hierarchy.

# Treaties and Peace in South Sulawesi

Peace, then, also had to be more than just a cessation of hostilities. Rather, it established personal, familial relationships between kingdoms by which the signatories could gain security.  

Generally, there were no punitive indemnities the vanquished had to pay (the leniency of peace treaties is discussed in more depth in the next post). Rather, what was paid was a *sebbu kati*, a sort of fine embedded in the sacred number 3, such as three types of items or three of a specific item. 

Once this had been paid, relationships were formally reestablished through a treaty, or the giving of words of honor (*makkuluada* or *ma'ulukana*). As I briefly noted earlier, the relationship between victor and vanquished was defined in terms of a familial relationship common in Austronesian societies: brother and brother, older and younger brother, parent and child, master and slave. These settlements defined the status of the signatories. The aim of kingdoms in South Sulawesi was ""to maintain proper status differences"" through which a kingdom could gain protection, just as a child could be protected by his parent. Treaties held power because they were accepted by all to be the way to preserve the harmony of society, just as family ties preserved the harmony of society on a smaller level. Indeed, the empire of Gowa, facing collapse before a Bugis-Dutch alliance in the Makassar War in the 1660s, had this to say to its vassal:

&gt; Go home and seek your own welfare because Gowa is hard-pressed and can no longer provide you the wings under which you can shelter.

The treaties of peace that Gowa had signed following its wars of conquest obligated the vassal to help its ""father"" and Gowa to provide for its ""child."" Gowa was no longer capable of meeting these obligations, and the power relationships of Gowa and its vassals were broken. Like this, family ties could also change depending on the geopolitical circumstances. After the Makassar War the Dutch replaced Gowa as the parent of the Bugis kingdoms, the children.

The strength of family ties in treaties is shown by the behavior of the kingdom of Soppeng in the late 16th century. Gowa was becoming far too powerful, and the three Bugis kingdoms of Bone, Wajoq, and Soppeng decided to ally. But Soppeng was so weak that it asked to enter a parent-child relationship with Bone and Wajoq. Bone and Wajoq each gave up some of their territory to Soppeng so that Soppeng could be the youngest brother and not a child. The conception of alliances as family members was so strong that it made Bone and Wajoq do things which would not make sense in realpolitik. 

There is, however, a different type of peace. It is the *ceppa* or *cappa*, literally meaning ""to take part in something."" A *ceppa* is not an exchange of oaths (*sitelli*), a sworn word of honor (*makkuluada*), or even a promise (*ma'janci*). It is, very literally, something that the signatories participate in. This type of peace is rarely mentioned in the chronicles, but the most notable exception is the Treaty of Bungaya of 1667, which the Dutch and their allies forced on a vanquished Gowa. The extremely punitive treaty that the Dutch had enforced on Gowa was, perhaps, not a treaty that held the full range of ritual significance that words of honor had (I include the terms of Bungaya in my notes, it might be nice to contrast the lenient terms of normal peace treaties in South Sulawesi - explained in detail in the following section - with Bungaya).

"/u/commiespaceinvader has explained this pretty well, though I should note that there is some minor scope for confusion, based on the fact that Irving wasn't always a Holocaust denier, at least not openly, and was somewhat well-known before he became one openly (unlike most Holocaust deniers, who are known simply for being Holocaust deniers).

From his emergence in the 1960s to the mid-1980s, Irving seemed to at least tacitly acknowledge the Holocaust. After all, his thesis in the initial edition of *Hitler's War* (1977) that Hitler didn't know about the Holocaust until 1943 doesn't really make any sense unless there was a Holocaust for him to be uninformed about. This doesn't mean that Irving's books during this period were actually any good - from the start they were heavily attacked by serious historians as apologetics for the German side, and of low scholarly merit.

In about 1988, Irving shifted to a more openly denialist position, though he was ambiguous about this - as he still had some popular reputation (though not an academic reputation) as a historian, he occasionally appeared on mainstream media platforms, and in these appearances he generally cut back his denial to an extent. For example, in a 1994 speech to other Holocaust deniers, he claimed the number of Jews who died in Nazi camps was 600,000; just a year later, in an interview on Australian radio, he upped this to 4 million.

Following the Lipstadt trial result in 2000, where any remaining popular reputation Irving had as a historian was decisively swept away, Irving ditched the ambiguity and from then on denied the whole Holocaust the whole time.",AskHistorians,0

"I see it as beneficial to take on people with with those opinions. Show sources, question their logic, and expose their thought processes.

This is for those interested in discussion, though. I wouldn't expect someone who is averse to conflict to take these people on. But if no one does, those people are left to go unchallenged in their corners, convincing those who would otherwise not believe the denialists had there been evidence to counter them.

Refusing a platform to someone who you know to be a liar gives him credibility for not having the opportunity to lie and be exposed. The audience will only see that you fear what he might say, whether it be lie or truth, and doubt your credibility in the off chance it might be a truth.

With several units (especially late war as units were reorganized with an eye towards ethnic heterogeneity to tamp down any nationalistic uprisings as the fragility of the empire was becoming increasingly apparent), many, many, languages could be spoken - and indeed with something like 11 official languages, clear and concise communication within the Austro-Hungarian army was one of their major issues during the First World War.

My own Hungarian is pretty basic and rusty, but... Gondolok magyar nyelv van nehez egyserű. Sók szerencsét kivánok!",AskHistorians,0
"Oh, sorry, that's usually how medieval dialects end up getting discussed, because it's so hard to say where one ends and another begins. You'll find Chaucer's, for example, described in scholarship as London chancery, London clerical, Central Midlands, Midlands-Kent, etc.",AskHistorians,0

"Thanks for the reply! Of course I expect there to be a variety of views on the subject, and how the subject is taught in schools probably depends on the teachers as well. I was just wondering if there was a dominant view of the topic in Britain in itself. 

In Bangladesh the dominant view is certainly that the British were arrogant bastards who bled the subcontinent dry.

&gt;""The railway system?""

&gt;""Education?""

&gt;""Built the mining industry?""

&gt;""Alright, apart from the railway, the mining, education and public health, what have the British ever done for us?""

I can add that I have read very similar accounts of Jewish children being killed this way in primary sources from Southern Russia. I have also heard from a historian of the Auschwitz trials that this form of killing babies was described at that West German trial. ,AskHistorians,0

"From my anecdotal experience I have gathered that the Wehrmacht guy was most likely voluntary although grew up believing in the ideology (which was obviously only his circumstance.) 

So let's say a voluntarily enlisted young Wehrmacht soldier got out of Germany and escaped to the US with a false identity and was later discovered. 1946 sounds alright for this purpose. Would he be punished very severely or not much at all?",AskHistorians,0

"This assumes that advancing *into* combat is the natural tendency of melee combatants. Historians like Keegan, Hanson, Goldsworthy, and others have proposed that ancient warfare is, well, @^%#ing terrifying, and that the main issue officers had to deal with is with men backing away from the fight, not moving towards it. 

For example, Thucydides describes the tendency of the right wing of phalanxes to drift away from the enemy and become over-extended out of fear, because the right-most hoplite doesn't have a person covering his right side, and so unconsciously shies away.

While it's possible or even probable that the edges of engagements got fuzzy, I don't think it's in the way that you think, with soldiers being highly aggressive.",AskHistorians,0
