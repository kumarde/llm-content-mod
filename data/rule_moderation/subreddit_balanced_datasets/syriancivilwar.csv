Don't make things personal, it might bite right back at you. 

>IS is fighting hard here, more hard than in front of the YPG/SDF where they mosly retreat and harrass. They only fight this hard against SAA

IS uses different tactics in different regions, in northern Aleppo the known tactic is the extensive usage of VBIED's who scare the rebels really quickly, provoking a mass rout. This might be due to low morale or low motivation to fight IS or other factors. The SAA usually doesn't have close air support but just support through bombings all around the place, when Russia is involved like in Palymra it can be called CAS. 

>more hard than in front of the YPG/SDF where they mosly retreat and harrass.

There is no way to assess that, IS did fight really hard to recapture the Tishrin dam area but was pushed back after the YPG held their lines, the extent of support is a different question. 

>they also have way more firepower than rebels.

Not at all, whilst the YPG and SDF are a very good force, they are so with very little weapons and armor, for example in Afrin they have less than 10 armor pieces. The issue here is that Turkey will not accept more support for the SDF so firepower seen they are definitely inferior when compared to the rebels in northern Aleppo. ",syriancivilwar,1

"> It seems that yes. So much influence, so little intelligence

Sorry, but this is very wrong. Journalism does often attract some of the smartest students, also some of the most intelligent journalists are writing the best propaganda. They know what they do even if it is no good. 

Al qaida is no threat to western power what so ever. A threat to western civilians perhaps, but for western power they are useful, and only useful. They are useful against enemy states like socialist Afghanistan since 1978 and Libya/Syria 2011. They are also useful as reason for occupations.

Journalists are not stupid, but they just choose to work for western imperialism in imperialist media. They paint the ""reality"" as good as they can for this cause. Some of them are very good at what they do. For instance making americans believe Saddam Hussein was connected to al Qaida, for downplaying the role of the fascist Right Sector in the Ukraine Coup 2014, for downplaying the Russian friendly attitudes of eastern Ukraine in the following civil war, for downplaying islamists role in Syria and Libya 2011. For whitewashing CIA and Gulen movement in Turkey. List goes on an on.

Those ""journalists"" (propaganda writers) are very smart and knows their trade. MSM fake news have worked very well for decades and could probably continue if their imperialist basis was working. Problem is it just does not work. They are not winning their wars anymore, then people start talking about the facts(like Trump for instance dared to do regarding Syria).",syriancivilwar,1

"> Russia has zero ship building skills, they cannot build anything bigger than the corvette and they are decades behind schedule. Not only that they don't know how to install high tech electronics. 

Same old propaganda and bullshit on so many levels. The main problem is that USSR shipyards for big ships were created in Ukraine, so we lost access to them since USSR collapse, then it was a financial crisis and stuff and only in last decade Russia started rebuilding its shipyards. As to 'don't know how to install hight tech electronics'- yeah, I remember a shitstorm that our 'oceanographic vessel' created in western press a couple of days ago.

>That's why they asked the french to build on carrier with Russian engineers watching. So they could learn how to build ships, and why they wanted one done in Russia with french telling them what to do.

Not 'how to build ships' but how to assemble ships constructed in several major parts that are later put together. Russia historically builds ships in one piece and usually smaller, because our 'sea doctrine' requires the ability to sail in our northern seas. It's actually the reason why decision to buy French ships was so furiously opposed in Russia back in the day, because we actually had no use to them as they can be used in hot waters only.

Just a tip for you: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirov-class_battlecruiser (28000 tonnes)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral-class_amphibious_assault_ship (21300 tonnes)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arktika_(2016_icebreaker) (33540 tonnes)

So Russia was building before and builds bigger ships than Mistral now. Stop spreading bullshit.

>Despite the ""russia stronk"" crowed on this sub, the designer of the Bulava said Russia was 30 years behind the west in developing conventional arms. 

Out of context phrase.

>That gap is only widening, he also said Russia was 15 years ahead of the west in medium sized missiles, but that gap is closed every day.

Prove it.

>Russia is still living off the soviet union, lots of painted rust, and its only going to get worse.

Another bullshit. Most of Russian military forces are already reequipped with newest designs and by 2020 80% of army will operate complexes that never existed in USSR.

>Russia will cease to be Russia by 2050 with the demographic collapse they are facing. 

Another propaganda bullshit. Russia is growing in population for some years already (one of the best fertile rates in Europe). 'Russian cross' left behind decade ago.

>Factor in economics and Russia isn't going to be a regional power much longer.

https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2016/08/260813.htm

QUESTION: On Syria. The Russian ministry of defense says that in Aleppo there was recently a chemical weapons attack and that it was conducted by the Harakat Nour al-Zenki organization, which is an opposition group that has received support from the United States. Is the United States still supporting this organization?

MR TONER: So – unaware of that allegation. The only thing I’m aware of is the alleged chemical weapons attack on the town of Saraqeb. I don’t – I think we’re talking about separate incidents if I’m correct. I don’t know.

QUESTION: I’m referring to something in Aleppo.

MR TONER: This was – you’re talking about something in Aleppo. So haven’t seen those reports. Obviously, as we said with the incident that took place I think two days ago, allegedly, there were reports of chemical weapons being used in another town. But the same would hold true with this, is obviously we condemn strongly the use of any chemical weapons, and any credible allegations of their use in Syria we’ll investigate. And I believe it’s the purview of the OPCW that would carry out such an investigation.

As to your follow-up question about this group, I don’t have in front of me that we actually fund them. I mean, we – you’re saying we provide them with assistance?

QUESTION: Yes, as part of the so-called moderate opposition.

MR TONER: Yeah. I don’t know what --

QUESTION: Now, the group also --

MR TONER: Again, I haven’t seen the allegations yet, so I think it’s too early for me to (a) make that assessment and (b) make that connection.

"Which would be the best and which would be the worst for the people of Syria.

The best.

Regime 

Assad is by no means a perfect leader.  However Syria as a nation would be at least in tact if they were to win.  He already made some election reform allowing multiple parties back in 2011, and the real future lays in the establishment moving towards fair political transition.  Preserving the rights of all people in Syria is important, and you can work from where it was to a better Syria by using the existing infrastructure.  It isn't ideal, but no society is ideal, but this framework is something you could move towards a better ideal future.

SDF 

While the SDF has Democratic in its name there are still a lot of issues when this alliance of groups.  Some say the YPG is too dominant, and that has caused some rifts between the groups.  Although there are fault lines in the alliance there still is not enough cohesiveness to make it work.   It still in my opinion is the best of all the groups alternative to the regime, but it's lack of complete cohesion and defined structure makes it similar to the regime, but without the infrastructure.   It has a better model for success than other opposition groups, but its lack of true cohesive infrastructure makes it less desirable than the regime.   It has the right idea but should work on the political structure and cohesiveness. If I were to see them truly succeed it would be working with the Regime to secure the state and then creating a political party merging within the system.  To me that would be the best future for the SDF/Syria because what they are bringing in theory to the table in political views would be the perfect answer to the Bathist that could help steer Syria toward better rights for all including fair representation.

FSA

While many try and root for the FSA as the ""Rebels"" They have shown time and time again that there is little true cohesion.  Some lean/defect to Nusra, some to ISIS, some to the SAA.  It's a faction by name only with the only things that are binding them is ""We are anti-assad"".  There is no political structure to them and the fragmentation inside with the ""anti-assad"" position removed if they were to succeed would cause a loose fife dom of warlords all trying to secure their claim for supremacy.  It's Afghanistan all over again with no real structure except which area is defined by which group has what guns/weapons for protection.   In fighting will be rampant and the Civil War will continue for the unforeseeable future because nobody will agree on anything.

Nusra

Or what I like to call ISIS-Lite or ""Professional ISIS"".  They want the same thing as ISIS, but are smarter in that they don't publically declare their religious fascism in decapitation videos and mass shootings.  They had ties to ISIS are affiliated with Al Qaeda and are quietly letting ISIS get the brunt of the world condemnation and allowing ISIS to be taken out so they can seize power later.  They want the same thing as ISIS with a Caliphate/Emeriate and are already taking steps to cleanse the land from Non-belivers.  If they were to win the religious minorities would be exterminated, their religious sites destroyed, and imposing the Sharia on all.   After the dust is settled they would turn their attention to expanding their reach which probably would either be Turkey or Lebanon.  More than likely Lebanon where they would try to eliminate Hezbollah and pursue a takeover of Lebanon reminiscent of the the Lebanese Civil War where Syria tried to exert control over Lebanon, but this time with a Salafist movement running the show.  Turkey would be next where they already currently have large supply lines and contacts.  After that the Balkans and then Europe.   They might try and take Jordan if possible as well before Turkey because it would be less military resistance.  Either way if these guys win it would be a pain in the ass for every neighbor and any religious minority.

ISIS

Obviously these guys are assholes.  You don't have to see a burning cage of prisoners mass executed to know that they give zero fucks about brutality and totalitarian rule.  These guys don't hide it like Nusra and they would systematically murder anyone who didn't subscribe to their doctrine.  They would want Iraq back first and would probably go after Jordan next while keeping up their terrorist cells in countries abroad. ",syriancivilwar,0

"I already mentioned trust in the media, but what about the trust in US government by its citizens? It's been progressively diminishing and, at this moment, hovering around all-time low levels.  

http://www.people-press.org/2015/11/23/1-trust-in-government-1958-2015/

You say that the US is working on solving the real problems with its democracy, but not even US citizens trust their government to do its job adequately so why should we? Being honest here, would you take advice on portafolio investments from a broke guy or marriage advice from someone who's divorced more than once?  

I do in fact read the Washington Post and The New York Times. Their reporting is pretty good in many instances - they wouldn't be good propaganda outlets if they weren't subtle - but I also keep track of them pushing specific agendas or out-right hack-jobs. As a matter of fact - and I don't know if you've been able to tell by now I'm an avid news reader with an excelent memory - I constantly use their reporting as a barometer to get an idea of the general climate around a series of issues.   

That's how I know that that your assessment on the voter purgers is not acurate. I was specifically referring to cases that gathered lots of publicity in North Carolina, Alabama and Georgia just a couple of months ago. Here, I'm even going to link a NYT piece which tells very different stories:

http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/01/us/critics-see-efforts-to-purge-minorities-from-voter-rolls-in-new-elections-rules.html

These cases are reminiscent of another widely publicited voter purge in New York which resulted in the chief clerk of the New York Election Board in Brooklyn being sacked back in April. 

http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/officials-investigating-why-126000-voters-were-purged-from-ny-rolls/

A quote from the article:

&gt; The purge drew the attention of city and state officials and raised concerns in a state **already under fire for years over its election practices**. [emphasis mine]

It's a recurring trend. Here's a report by NBC that mentions purges in Kansas, Florida, Texas, Indiana, Mississippi (the deep south needs lots of verification, lots of potential work for USAID).

http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/do-voter-purges-discriminate-against-poor-minorities-n636586

And I'm not going to mention the more recent Ohio purge - this one in fact had to do with an interpretation of the law that allowed the state to punish those who hadn't voted in 8 years but since was struck down by a ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals a couple of weeks ago I'll let it pass. But I also haven't delved the big clusterfuck that's Arizona Secretary of State and the elections commission there or the many irregularities in California and other states all around the country... I think you get the idea. 

One last thing on the issue of voter purges. I'll quote a single line from your latest response which, I believe, helps to summarize one of the many reasons why the US political system and the way you conduct things over there is in not applicable to our own, even despite your best intentions (I'll give you the benefit of the doubt here). 

You said that people had not voted in 8 years and therefore the ""registration with their parties had thus lapsed."" We in Venezuela do not have to be affiliated to a political party in order to vote for any political position. I personally find it non-sensical that you'd have to and I'm actually curious to know if it does make any sense to you, since you used it as a justification for that particular point I brought up. 

I had already mentioned voter apathy and participation, add another score to the ways that Venezuelan election system is more advanced than that of the US (despite its failures and limitations, which exist of course, I can point out many other elements where this is absolutely true). 

The funny thing is that, since political parties in the US are private entities, they can do whatever they want and there's not even a way to challenge their actions. Poor Venezuelans are are forced to turn to folks like USAID and NED for the resources to support the basic tasks of civic mobilization and activity, but where do, for example, poor Coloradans turn to when all the RNC delegates are given to Ted Cruz without even taking a vote just because...? I just brought that single event as an example, but this entire election cycle has given us abundant examples of US parties' national comitees going full Machiavelli in regards to the will of the voters. 

I can probably spend many hours providing supporting for all the other things I wrote. I understand that some people in the US believe they have a responsability with the World to use their prominent position and spread the greater good all around. I still believe you're not in a good position to do it right now, you'd first have to do some deep cleansing in you own house in order to try to put your neighbors' in order. 

But since the truth is that the US does not care for anything else but their out geopolitical standing and their interests abroad I know that all this is just vacuous talk. It doesn't even matter is the entire US political establishment was crumbling... organizations like USAID and NED will alway play their rol abroad well.

It was an interesting exchange of ideas. Good luck in your endevours.

"Western media workers (I hesitate to call them journalists, since in my opinion most do not deserve to be described with that word) are not being told at gunpoint what to report, except maybe in very rare cases (although I'm not aware of there being any proof that it ever happens at all). However, I think that if you study the Western news media, you'll see that there are ""waves"" of reporting, and that a lot of the news content in a given wave will use the same sort of ideas and language as the other content in the same wave. For example, sometimes you'll see the same adjective pop up in seemingly unrelated sources on the same day more frequently than simple coincidence would seem to explain. And since it's all coming out on the same day, this can't be a matter of the media sources copying from each other — the only explanation I can think of is that various media sources take the same original source as their template. Such templates are not necessarily secret — probably, in some cases they are just the official government releases — however, they do seem to me to exist.

Not that I think Russian media is any better — likely the opposite. You can see Russian propaganda in, for example, the ludicrous use of the word ""terrorist"" to label all anti-Assad fighters. And I suspect that being an anti-establishment journalist in Russia is probably more physically dangerous than being an anti-establishment journalist in the West is. But yes, I do see evidence that Western media is propagandistic in nature.

Couple of interesting bits:

&gt;U.S. officials said the moves are part of an effort to rebuild U.S. intelligence capabilities that had continued to atrophy even as Russia sought to reassert itself as a global power. Over the past two years, officials said, the United States was caught flat-footed by Moscow’s aggression, including its annexation of Crimea, its intervention in the war in Syria and its suspected role in hacking operations against the United States and Europe.

.

&gt;Clapper and other U.S. intelligence officials have said that Putin’s renewed aggression against the United States appears to be driven in part by his paranoia that the CIA and other agencies have been behind public uprisings — including throngs of demonstrators in 2012, scenes that analysts say unnerved Putin before his return to the presidency.

&gt;“He assigns a lot of influence and agency to organizations like the CIA,” McFaul said. “He grossly exaggerates what they can do in the world and what they can do in Washington. But because he’s got that mind-set, he wants to win that war.”

"That clip is cut short and doesn't accurately portray what General Dunford was attempting to communicate. He was answering a question about what it would take to achieve total air superiority, not what it would take to establish a no-fly zone.

Dunford goes on to clarify:

&gt; That's not what I said chairman. What senator asked me was, to control all of the airspace....  

&gt;&gt;No, what he asked was should we have a no-fly zone to protect these people from being slaughtered. 

&gt; I answered that first.  

&gt;&gt; So that would not require going to war, full-scale, would it?
  
&gt; Not necessarily, Senator. I'm sorry but I tried to answer the first question first, and then I was responding to the second part of your question. **I did not mean to say that imposing a no-fly zone would require us to go to war**, that's not the question I was answering.

I realize that many will view this statement in the same light as the one he's purported to have made. But it is a very different question. Now that I know the question he was actually answering, I think he was being a bit condescendingly dramatic with his response.  I think he wanted to communicate his displeasure about being asked what he felt was a stupid question about military matters by a guy in a suit.

To use a silly but more accessible example, imagine your  aunt asks you to clean the crapware off her 15-year-old computer. You do so, and she asks, ""Great! Does this mean I have Windows 10 now?""  *No, auntie, for that you'd have to buy a new computer...*",syriancivilwar,0

What does this mean in terms of the lives of Syrians? This is a useless discussion.

Well the SAA is not going to vanish. Most pro-intervention people do not support vanishing of the SAA.

&gt;Finally, the stated goal of those who advocate the use of coercion and the select arming of rebel groups is not an improbable military victory but leverage and options in a political process meant to achieve a settlement that delivers political inclusion, minority rights, and security guarantees and also creates the conditions for the isolation and ultimately weakening of jihadi groups.

When he responded positively, the official invitation to Dugin was extended by the Eurasia Local Administrations Union, which is known to be close to the government in Ankara. This is how the relations that were almost severed moved toward restoration June 27 with the invitation letter sent to the Kremlin.

&gt;While other measures were being taken to restore relations between Turkey and Russia, Moscow took its first unofficial step toward Ankara, with Dugin arriving in Ankara on July 13 and meeting with advisers of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Undersecretary for Public Order and Security Muhammet Dervisoglu. The key subject discussed with Dugin’s Ankara contacts was Syria. The message Dugin delivered to Turkish advisers was about “Turkey’s cooperation for a solution in Syria and its taking concrete and quick steps to severe its logistics-political support to anti-regime elements in Syria.”

&gt;According to Pekin, Dugin returned to Ankara on Aug. 3 and had bilateral meetings with advisers to Erdogan and Prime Minister Binali Yildirim. Again, the subject was Syria.]

Only a political expert with an exceptional knowledge of every dynamic to the conflict including its religious, ethnic and political aspects could offer an ultimate solution. I would like to think it would involve the removal of Assad but that's just my personal opinion. 

What I can offer though is a momentary solution to the crisis in places like Aleppo and similar cities like it where the civilians living there have been intentionally put through unimaginable suffering and mass loss of life. 

The best policy towards Syria right now would be for the US government to incentivize a UN sanctioned no-fly zone over cities that are in desperate need of large scale humanitarian relief. Once approved by the UN, The US government should form a coalition with Turkey and the Gulf states in addition to the preexisting Coalition of the Willing to enforce the no-fly zone. This would put Russia in a corner and give them no choice but to back down. 

If this was successfully negotiated at the UN it would likely not be far reaching enough to prevent ground warfare between the two sides but it would offer a breathing space for further diplomatic talks between the regime and the opposition. It could also have the potential to open up channels for a humanitarian relief effort via aid convoys now that air cover is provided.

It could save thousands of lives amongst already depleted pockets of civilians in places like Aleppo and Homs. ",syriancivilwar,0

M-19 conducted kidnapping and executions of certain high class civilians and union leaders that opposed them. My family member was a union worker that was seeing how the company they were working for was being extorted and drained by M-19. The union joined forces with the owners and refused to keep financing them. So they threatened everyone if they didn't give in to the money demands.

M-19 started being liked by lower and mid class: They had a legitimate cause (election fraud that deprived Gustavo Rojas Pinillas (a strongman yet also progressive dictator in the 40s that won the democratic elections 20 years later after he was ousted from power)) from the presidency. They used to capture meat and milk trucks, routed them to poor zones and distributed the goods among the people, then let the trucks and the drivers go.

Then they started kidpnapping relatives of the elite class and politicians, then kidnaping them alongside union workers and executing them (they said that it was a martial court for their crimes against the poor people) and it ended with them receiving money, info and training from Pablo Escobar to perform the siege of the Palacio de Justicia.

Honestly.  Do you understand what is at stake for the people of Syria?

I'll explain this as clearly as possible.

If the Rebels win there will be an ethnic cleansing of the religious minorities in Syria.  That is what the SAA government is fighting against.

It's not about Assad.  It's about a secular Syria for all religions, all people.

If you don't understand I'll gladly explain it for you, but Assad is the only thing standing in the way of the murder and harassment of millions of people because of their faith.   This includes Christian, Druze, Ismaili, Alawite, Sufi, and Shia. 

You are standing with a religious genocidal doctrine, and I don't think you all know that.

Please, I am begging as a human being to research what the ideologies of these groups are.  What they actually believe, and realize that it's not about the bombs being dropped.  It's not about the civilians caught in the crossfire.  It's about the right to exist for all people independent of their faith vs a group hell bent to cleanse all others who don't believe their specific viewpoint on religion.

You can't leave Syria without permission from the security apparatus which is dominated by alawites.

There are a couple of alawite families in Syria that controls virtually everything. And to top if off: Syria's prisons are full of political prisoners. Many are people who simply voiced their opposition to the unjust rule of the Alawites. Only a few days ago, one of the ""leaders"" of the assyrian christians in Syria was released from prison.
