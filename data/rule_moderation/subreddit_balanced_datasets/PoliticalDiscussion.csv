And then you hear these things being said and have the GALL to get on your computer and type about how racism must be worse under his term because the racists are now speaking out the things that have always been under the surface.

Yeah.  Stay Rural, bruh.  Because the day you explain this theory to one of us in person, you might learn that not all minorities are as gracious as Obama.

"> Gun suicides make up 50% of all successful suicides in the US. This comes from the CDC which is as unbiased a source as you can get. Therefore reducing gun suicide meaningfully reduces all suicides.

In the vacuum that is your brain maybe, but in reality those people will find other ways like suffocation, the largest growing method of suicide.

>I don't know the numbers from those countries, but medical research from Harvard University and other institutions has shown that states with lower gun ownership has lower suicide rates. So gun control in the US has been proven to decrease suicide.

Hemenway is a known anti-gunner who can not be trusted to make good studies. The fact is many countries with less guns have more suicides.

>I don't know numbers, here, but it's a little disingenuous to compare the US to other countries with different cultures. 

Oh fuck off, in the next breath you will say it is legitimate to compare us to them when comparing crime stats though I fucking bet.

Culture has noting to do with suicide success.

>For example, in the US, a predominantly Christian country, suicide is considered a crime.

There are other countries with more suicides, like France, Finland, Germany, Austria, Russian. Are those Christian enough for you?

The first is the assumption that China's emerging middle class won't change their country socially over the next couple of decades. 

Ideas like environmental health, emissions standards, labor, minimum wages, workplace safety, and other ""costs"" to labor are going to happen in China whether they like it or not.

People there are already pissed about the horrible air quality and solid waste issues. Believe me, it's gonna change.

So they don't vote unless a candidate passes every single one of their ideological purity tests (which is pretty much impossible) and they will instantly give up on politics based on idealism (I.E. how many young people complain about Obama not shutting down Gitmo and completely gave up on him just because of that, despite the realities of the situation meaning it's quite reasonable that Obama failed to enact change)

Political parties realised this a long time ago, older voters are far more pragmatic and regularly vote, hence it's far better to court their votes. Courting young people's vote is borderline pointless, you can't even TALK to Wall Street without them freaking the fuck out and calling you the devil. So instead political parties simply concentrate on making sure that young people DON'T vote for the other guy. Just point out that a candidate is not perfect, and young people become apathetic and stop voting, and you can safely ignore them. 

It's compounded by the fact that...well...time moves forward. Everyone will one day become old, but people have already been young. By the time someone has the knowledge, the skills and networking to create youth based political movements, they're not young anymore.

Not by anyone with critical thinking skills.

1. One email account being compromised doesn't change the fact that there were hundreds of other unrelated Wikileaks about her tenure and the policies of the Obama administration. Not too mention her 20 year public record of statements contradicting one another or her campaign strategy of throwing her left-wing base under the bus. To think none of that effect the outcome of the election, and instead blame the Podesta emails for her loss is unfathomably idiotic. This theory also assumes that the polling was accurate all the way up until 6 hours into election Tuesday. His emails did not effect the outcome.

2. CIA claims are not credible. Let's just overlook the fact that the CIA has a long documented history of lying to manipulate political agendas and to over-hype threats as a means of protecting there budget. National Security director James Clapper is a known liar and has lied to the public and congress before under oath.

3. Any script-kiddie can tell you that the easiest way to spoof an attack from any country is to gain control a computer system inside the Geo-location of a certain nation and use it as a beachhead for intrusion. The methods for determining state involvement are based on guesses and models and are subject to be interpreted anyway the CIA wants it to be. In short they have zero proof of any official connection despite their claims. 

4. The claim of Russian interference has no link to reality and is clearly politically motivated. The claims were first made without the slightest bit of proof back when the Podesta emails first leaked. They were made to distract the public from the hypocrisy and election rigging apparent in the emails.

5. The official claim of election tampering is patently false. No hack of any voting equipment ever occurred and the count was never affected by an outside power. Also its a completely absurd claim that an election is made illegitimate when voters receive truthful information about one of the candidates. 

Taking in whole, this latest spat about Russians is a continuation of the Obama administration's war-propaganda effort against Russia and their allies.

"> For you to suggest that Trump is losing with every demographic and basing that off of polls 4 months before the election instead of basing it on the PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY VOTED FOR HIM, is completely nonsensical. 

I don't see how it's nonsensical at all. It's absolutely possible Trump won many demographics in the primary elections, that he's losing now that the voter pool isn't just Republicans.

Overall amongst the populace, he's losing with women, minorities, and now even college-educated men. 

And you say its 4 months out, but while individual polls might not tell the whole picture, a consistent and aggregated trend does. And he is trending downward HARD.

By the way, this is politicaldisussion. Not politics. If you're so convinced Trump will win with demographics show me actual polls and analysis of how and when he's going to do that. Because so far, it doesn't seem like it exists.

The only referenda allowed under Dutch law (and only since 2013) are non-binding referenda on specific initiatives, explicitly excluding things like EU membership. If a coalition were to promise a referendum, they'd have to create new legislation which would have to pass two chambers. The 2013 law already barely passed, and only with the support of the left wing parties - none of which would ever be in a position to have a coalition supported by Wilders. 

Which brings me to the second point -even the right-wing parties that fundamentally oppose all referenda (very different from the Tories) are very unlikely to join in a coalition with Wilders ever again. The one coalition propped up by the PVV was a short-lived disaster, and it destroyed the Christian Democrats and soured the relationship between the Liberals and the PVV. The PVV has become a toxic brand that all other parties have outright refused to be associated with again in the future.

While I can't invalidate the notion that ""most"" supporters dislike him for those reasons, I can explain why I personally have contempt for him. My support for Clinton is not a cause of it.

Assange/Wikileaks undermines diplomacy itself, and therefore undermines peace. The cable leaks embarrass the diplomats and world leaders by revealing their candid conversations and thoughts. Wikileaks just spread everything it got, regardless of whether there was even a whiff of ""corruption"".

If there's no corruption, there are just two reasons one might pretend to offer to justify this act. 1) The very existence of private conversations between officers of different states is somehow unethical, or 2) the leaks were necessary to reveal security vulnerabilities in the cable system.

1 is pretty damn stupid. *Everything* needs to be exposed to the light of day? John Kerry can't candidly tell Obama that some foreign leader is willing to play ball on a peace treaty but because he's so prideful we have to be extra careful to present the plan as if it was his idea? Endless exposure will inhibit honest conversations like these.

2 is circular idiocy. Leaks are good because they highlight the need to prevent leaks, which are bad?

"So here's a little bit of a Pakistani perspective, especially because somehow the country comes up whenever India is discussed. Just a side note, I've tried and source all my points with neutral articles, notice that I don't have a single Pakistani newspaper cited. 86 Kashmiri protesters have died at the hands of the Indian government, now is it more likely that this attack is related to them or related to some sort of Pakistani bogeyman? 

A large part of the current (misplaced) anti-Pakistan rhetoric is due to one man, Narendra Modi. Modi is the current prime minister of India and former chief minister of the Gujurat state. Before 2012 (I believe) he was actually banned from even entering the United States because of his alleged role in secreterian violence (https://news.vice.com/article/narendra-modis-shame-muslim-survivors-of-the-gujarat-riots-are-still-suffering). Modi continues to deploy such political strong arming in the disputed territory of Kashmir (the recent killing of Burhan Wani and the subsequent protests, http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-36762043) by sending in the military on Kasmiri protesters seeking the right to self-determination. Now Modi, continues to paint Pakistan in a bad light by claiming that the Pakistani province of Baluchistan is also disputed territory, despite the fact that much of the disrupt can be traced back to India (http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/man-arrested-in-pakistan-is-former-navy-officer-has-no-links-with-govt-mea/), with an Indian spy (or ex-navy officer) being arrested in the remote province with no valid reason for actually being there. He claims Wani was a terrorist, but Kasmiris claim him as a freedom fighter. Modi claims that Pakistan spreads terrorism, but the recent Zarb e Azr operation in Pakistan by the Pakistani military has killed over 3400 terrorists and resulted in the death of almost 500 Pakistani soldiers (http://m.economictimes.com/news/defence/490-pakistan-soldiers-3500-militants-killed-in-operation-zarb-e-azb/articleshow/52766005.cms) 

Has Pakistan in the past used militant groups to counter Indian influence? Yes. 

But here's the thing, the US has done that in South America and previously in Afghanistan. India is doing it now, as was Pakistan. Global politics are Machiavellin, and there are no good countries and bad countries. And there are no friends. The US and Pakistan were at one point much much closer than India and the US now, look how that relationship is going.

The ACA expanded Medicaid to cover more people and in theory it should've helped but a lot of red states opted out of the expansion. Coincidentally, a lot of poor people live in red states, so there are a lot of poor people who are still uninsured because their income is slightly over the qualifying threshold.

When there exists a cohesive identity, regardless of what that identity is, which distinguishes it from others so that there is a community of people with a shared identity, and a feature of that identity impels that community towards an action, we can with complete fidelity *attribute responsibility and ownership towards and of that community for those actions on the basis of their identity impelling it to be taken, even if not all members of the community took those actions.*

Examples:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine

That is not a result of Western in general attitudes towards bile and fever and waste elimination, nor specifically Latin ones, nor specifically  Grecian ones (these existed, and informed a now-defunct ""Western"" medicine that thought about 'humors' and 'temperaments' that altered the condition of the psyche and body in tandem)

There are no people whose cultural and intellectual inheritance derives solely from notions about phlegmatic dispositions or, say, germ theory, that can say they have claim and stewardship over traditional Chinese medicine. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_music

This is not a result of South Asian people's ideas about Carnatic tones or the Aeolian people's mode of diatonic scales. No one singing a raga or playing a Waltz as a result of their membership in such a training can _really_  say, absent such instruction in Hausa music, absent doership within that creative community or inherited tradition, that somehow, Hausa music is ""their"" music.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_East_Germany#Visual_art

This was not a result of Latino intellectual's attitudes about visual medium, nor the product of Japanese attitudes towards form and function in brand messaging or art.  Neither Frieda Kahlo, nor Izumo no Okuni, nor people whose tutelage in art and design derives wholly from the  (laaaaaarge) traditions of those two can say ""yes, I have a deep and real connection to the culture and attitudes of the DDR as goes the State production of propaganda.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goguryeo#Centralization_and_early_expansion_.28mid-first_century.29

These decisions about statecraft cannot be attributed to early colonial peoples from Britain or the Netherlands, nor their eventual American ideals of government or warfare.  D


They are _Chinese_ attitudes towards the body, they are _Hausa_ perceptions of sound and rhythm, they are German, and furthermore _eastern_ German, _communist_ German notions about ideological communication. They are old Korean principles of conquest and State.

**No one would make any kind of serious case for the absence of a nexus of people and result.**

No one would assume that, had the people who effected these things in the world _never_ to have existed, that they would've simply come into the world _anyway_ just as they did in the first place.

Curiously, curiously, when it comes to the _negative_ results of certain groups of people, there are some who would have us believe that there **cannot ever!** be any sort of connection whatsoever between identity and effect, between choice and consequence, between being and doing, between prior and posterior. 

Strange! 


Somehow, there is **no relation at all** to be found between a man exclaiming that Allah is the greatest in Arabic, who may have even left testimony of his desire to kill people he imagines to be 'kuffar' that do not accept Allah SWT is the only god, and Muhammad PBUH is his Messenger , and, say, the writings of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, or the historical conduct of Muhammad himself, or people like the Mahmud of Gazni. None at all. 


There are other examples of this, but they don't seem to involve truly _loathesome_ groups like ""White Americans"" (or, horror of horrors _White Christian Americans who vote Republican and are probably even straight taxpayers!_); no, they tend to involve outgroups with low capital.

Not financial capital, but who Bourdieu would say is 'social' and 'cultural' capital. 

Somehow, when it comes to the _negative results authored by people of those communities, impelled by principles common to their identity_, then there's just no relationship at all between belief and action. None. None none none none.

And if you question that, you're a bigot. I haven't quite worked out what the rules of the game are, but I think something might be up with this!

"&gt; In that case, it was fear. 

It's not stoking fear or playing on fear to acknowledge reality.  We can argue that the current focus on terrorism is overblown while also acknowledging the very real threat the Soviets posed.

&gt; The point is note that when the USSR collapsed, another ""other"" was needed.

This, again, implies that it's not events that create an ""other,"" but simply need for an ""other"" to exist.  The reason the ""fear"" or focus on terrorism exists is because of terrorism, not because of Republicans (or anyone else) acknowledging terrorism.

&gt; I'd be less likely to believe it if I could see any other reason anyone would have for supporting Trump. 

In no particular order:

* He's the Republican candidate.
* He's viewed as the outsider candidate.
* He holds a position people want on a specific issue, immigration.
* He's not viewed as corrupted by the system.

Is there a pocket of people who see their own hate projected onto Trump?  Without a doubt.  But Clinton has those people, too, and neither candidate is being driven by that particular segment.

&gt; The only reason he is a political figure at all is his years of birtherism. 

He's a political figure because he's accomplished everything else he wants in life except this, and people are willing to go along with it.

&gt; Sorry, but I've heard too many of his supporters and surrogates speak for me believe that racism and xenophobia aren't driving his support.

"**Donald Taxes only from 2009 to Present are under audit**. [Source](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-31/trump-s-tax-lawyers-say-2002-2008-returns-no-longer-under-audit)

His taxes from 2008 and earlier are not under audit.  **If Donald Trump wanted too** (and my guess is he does not want to release his 2008 and prior year taxes) he could reveal these previous years taxes, and still keep his 2009 and newer taxes hidden since those **""old tax years""** are not under audit.

Furthermore you can always release your taxes even if you are under audit.  The paperwork is turned in, you can't change it.

Donald Trump does not want to be transparent, and he is making excuses of why not being transparent is not that bad of thing, or it is someone else's fault.

Nothing is stopping him from revealing his taxes besides he may feel doing so may be personally or politically embarrassing.

"**Voting for a third-party candidate is basically equivalent to casting half a vote for the major party candidate you prefer less.**

The following simplified example illustrates the point:

------------------------

Assume there are 100 likely voters in the electorate, broken down as follows:

Clinton     Trump     Johnson     Undecided

40            40          10             10

Suppose that an otherwise loyal Republican (the ""Swing Voter"") decides to defect from Trump based on having the following preferences: 

&gt;Johnson victory (most preferred) &gt; Clinton victory &gt; Trump victory (least preferred).  

To bring about Trump's defeat, she can (1) vote for Johnson or (2) vote for Clinton.

-------------------

Let's say Swing Voter decides to vote for Johnson, her first choice.  This creates a one-vote differential in Clinton's favor:

Clinton     Trump     Johnson     Undecided

40            39 (-1)   11 (+1)      10

-----------

Now suppose that the same Swing Voter were to support Clinton rather than Johnson. This creates a two-vote differential in Clinton's favor:

Clinton     Trump     Johnson     Undecided

41(+1)    39 (-1)     10            10

--------

Now assume the 10 undecided voters are basically indifferent between the candidates. To make up their mind on who to vote for, these voters will roll a die. If the die comes up 1 or 2, they'll vote Clinton; if it comes up 3 or 4, they'll vote Trump; and if it comes up 5 or 6, they'll vote for Johnson (*i.e.*, there's a one-third chance they'll vote for each candidate).   

Under either the vote-for-Johnson or vote-for-Clinton scenarios, Johnson's chance of winning is zero. Even if the Swing Voter votes for Johnson, the most votes Johnson could ever get would be 21 votes, assuming the dice came up with ten 5s or 6s in a row (an extremely unlikely event with a .0017% chance of occurring). Since 21 is less than Clinton's 40 in this scenario, Johnson can't win a plurality. 

Yet, the probability that Trump will win (the least preferred outcome for the Swing Voter) is higher in the vote-for-Johnson than it is in the vote-for-Clinton scenario. 

To see this, consider that to win in the vote-for-Johnson scenario, Trump would have to net 2 votes more than Clinton among undecided voters to overcome Clinton's 1 vote starting advantage. There are lots of ways to do that as long as Clinton did not win 5 or more votes (an outcome we'd expect 21.3% of the time). Note that even if Clinton gets fewer than 5 votes, there are quite a few ways Trump can still lose (*e.g.*, 5 votes for Trump, 4 votes for Clinton, 1 vote for Johnson; 3 votes for Clinton, 2 votes for Trump, 5 votes for Johnson).

By contrast, in the vote-for-Clinton scenario, Trump has to net 3 votes more than Clinton, which requires Clinton to not to get 4 or more votes in total (an outcome we'd expect 44.1% of the time). So there are comparatively fewer ways for Trump to win. 

I don't feel like doing the math to get the *exact* probabilities of Trump winning in each scenario. As noted, these upper boundary probabilities represent Trump's chance of a *guaranteed loss.* For rational decision-making purposes, it suffices to show, as here, that voting for Johnson rather than for Clinton increases the chance of a less-preferred outcome (Trump winning) and does not improve the chances of a more-preferred outcome (Johnson winning). 

Voting for Clinton hurts Trump about twice as much as voting for Johnson or against Trump does.

Put differently, if one's main objective is to defeat Trump not voting for Clinton would be throwing away half the power of your vote to achieve that objective. ",PoliticalDiscussion,0

Well, it would unnecessarily escalate tensions in the area.

That would then cascade to the increase of other goods/services.  The question of War depends on a lot of variables, so it's really hard to speculate.

"Yeah I imagine we'll see a lot of older conservative Latinos voting for Gary Johnson or abstaining altogether. They won't vote for Hillary but they won't give Trump their vote either, which is in the end a net victory for Clinton.",PoliticalDiscussion,0

Is he better at connecting with people though? That video of him giving out turtles and the photo of him canvassing at a drive through are not great.,PoliticalDiscussion,0
"You and those like you would be the exception.  But imagine if Johnson was not running and those who -would- vote, would  have voted for either Clinton or Trump?  

The logic is that the vote that would have gone for one of the two other parties is now missing because they went with the third party.  This makes it easier for the opposing party to win because the other party is now missing the vote they would have otherwise had.",PoliticalDiscussion,0

"This actually offers some conclusive proof to collaborate the possibility of him not paying anything in federal income taxes.

Of course without his tax returns we won't know for sure, and its hard to say if this story will gain any traction. But I imagine it can't hurt at least in terms of ratcheting up pressure on him over his tax returns. ",PoliticalDiscussion,0
"&gt; but it will be interesting to see how this would affect Hillary if at all.

If anything it helps her.  They paid 34 something percent in taxes, all this does is shed light on how she contributes to society and he doesn't",PoliticalDiscussion,0

"I was born and raised in the city of Oakland, ranked choice voting gave us Jean Quan as mayor.  That was a disaster of proportions that are impossible to explain.

She was in 3rd or 4th place if you counted the first choice ballots only. 

In theory ranked choice voting sounds fine, i have seen first hand just how awful it can turn out in practice",PoliticalDiscussion,0

"They're giving them eight years' representation but yeah.

The maximum punishment (literally the one for crimes against humanity and such) is 2-4 years in removing landmines. Anything less than crimes against humanity is amnesty.

And yeah, they're being paid for ""reintegration"". It's a bit awful.

The point is we're tired of war. And the government did a pretty good job marketing this as ""do you want peace or war"", which is why it nearly passed.",PoliticalDiscussion,0

"I wonder too. Even though they reportedly made up after Power called her a ""monster."" I don't think Hillary would choose her for the current position or a position of greater import like Secy of State. They do have a very similar worldview and calculus when it comes to foreign policy matters and Hillary does want a gender-diverse cabinet.",PoliticalDiscussion,0
"&gt; To be fair, they were elected. 

yup, this is why the complaints of a family dynasty taking over America falls on deaf ears. We have people with money, and we have people elected into office.
