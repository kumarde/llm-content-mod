"You could argue that. Whether it'd hold weight is a different matter considering guys generally do not care about a gal's height as much as gal's care about a guy's height.

It's not 'bad' to feel confident. It is pretty deceptive in my opinion to intentionally wear something to give someone a false impression. I highly doubt he's wearing taller shoes for his confidence and more likely to appeal to gals who like height.

Personally I think it's a bit bias to claim rejecting someone based on their height makes someone not worth knowing as I highly doubt you don't have attraction preferences yourself. So to think your preferences/criteria is somehow 'better' than a person who has height in theirs is a bit skewed to me. People like what they like. To me it comes across like a guy approaching a gal based on his attraction to her yet getting pissy when he's rejected because she doesn't find him attractive.",creepyPMs,1

It is important to note that the great majority of pedophiles understand that their fantasies are horrible and wrong and do not act on them. 

From everything that I understand, pedophilia is effectively a sexual orientation. Be it from some sort of chemical imbalance, there have been plenty of people who have done AMA's on Reddit, it's pretty clear that nobody but the most depraved would actually chose to be a pedophile. However, it's also one of the most stigmatized problems in our society (and rightfully so), far beyond that of other mental health problems. 

It's because of that stigmatization, many feel like they cannot go to a therapist or seek support from anyone that it becomes a deeply compartmentalized piece of who they are. 

Sorry to write you an essay, but it's something that really does make me sad. On any side of the issue it is tragic, and speaks to the need for genuine mental health services. ",creepyPMs,1

This is what I was taught by my mother. I'm sure that most women do not like never hearing from a person they had sex with and felt that that created a bond. I condemn such behaviour from all sides.

"Sounds like he may have some kind of mental illness? I knew a guy who also just got obsessed with certain people... some of them he had had significant interactions with, but others were really just acquaintances or people like retail workers whom he'd only ever talked to once.

He liked to talk about them, wondering what they were doing, devising different scenarios and then asking what I thought various ones would do, and usually he'd be giggling because they would be weird things like ""What if someone just walked up to (dude's name) and burped in his face? Do you think he would punch them? Do you think he would inhale the burp and go, 'yum yum!'?"" Keep in mind that I only knew one or two of these people, most of them I'd never met. He introduced me to one of the ones I didn't know once, and it was pretty clear they weren't exactly on the same page as far as being friends and they were probably a little creeped out by him (he was obviously mentally ill to anyone who interacted with him, but that doesn't make it less creepy). He wasn't a bad guy but he had a lot of weird stuff going on up in the ol' noodle.

Sorry, I don't know if maybe that makes it seem even creepier... but I suspect that while the guy texting you may have an easier time living day-to-day than the guy I knew, it seems like the same sort of thing. I hope it stops though, because that sucks.",creepyPMs,0

that last picture is honestly a really good explanation for his behavior; he probably thinks that through persistence he'll win you over and get his happy ending because that's how movies go; conquer the obstacle (in this case, probably that ""anger"" he's talking about) and get the girl. In fact, I can almost see the basic plot in his mind: boy meets girl in school, boy falls for girl, thinks girl may like him back (for no real reason in the real world) and calls her his girlfriend. One day, the girl leaves for some ~*foreign country*~ and gets married, and the boy pines after her for years. Then, one day, through the magic of the internet, he finds out she's single, and suddenly he sees his chance to make TRUE LOVE prevail! But unfortunately, she's angry about something and refuses to talk to him. No matter; he'll keep trying to slide into her dms and eventually, he shall emerge victorious, girl in hand!
