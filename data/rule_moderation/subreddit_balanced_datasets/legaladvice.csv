"IANAL, so take what you will of what I am about to say.

I believe that your boss is likely discriminating against you, for your gender or sex (and all the issue that define that word). But you will need to be smart in how you address this issue.

If I were in your shoes I would expect my boss to put this policy in writing and to justify the policy. If they refuse to do this, I would then calmly inform them that you until such a time as they provide a written policy, that applies to all employees, and not just the two of you, you will ignore this, likley unlawful condition of employment. I would then continue to explain that you and your coworker discuss issues of wage and workplace conditions, and that is protected by the National Labor Relations Act. This is called [Protected Concerted Activity](https://www.nlrb.gov/rights-we-protect/protected-concerted-activity).

The Federal Government, in the form of the NLRB defines Concerted Activity as:

> Federal law protects employees engaged in union activity, but that's only part of the story. Even if you're not represented by a union - even if you have zero interest in having a union - the National Labor Relations Act protects your right to band together with coworkers to improve your lives at work.

> You have the right to act with coworkers to address work-related issues in many ways. **Examples include: talking with one or more co-workers about your wages and benefits or other working conditions**, circulating a petition asking for better hours, participating in a concerted refusal to work in unsafe conditions, and joining with coworkers to talk directly to your employer, to a government agency, or to the media about problems in your workplace. Your employer cannot discharge, discipline, or threaten you for, or coercively question you about, this ""protected concerted"" activity. However, you can lose protection by saying things about your employer that are egregiously offensive or knowingly and maliciously false, or by publicly disparaging your employer's products or services without relating your complaints to any labor controversy.

By framing the issue in this manner you add another layer of protection for yourself and your coworker.

How I would respond, verbally would be something like this:

""I'm afraid that I do not understand why this policy is being applied to just the two of us. If you would be so good as to provide this policy, in writing, with the reasoning behind why this policy only applies to just the two of us, I would only be able to conclude that it is retaliation for either my gender/sex/sexual orientation, or some attempt to deny us our rights under the NLRA.""

Or you could contact an attorney in your area and ask them their opinion.


Just be aware that due to this 'at will' employment clause, your employer could terminate you. But... if you were to respond in the manner I presented, you would likely be able to provide some proof that your termination was due to retaliation in response to you asserting your rights; either those afforded you under the the NLRA (Protected Concerted Activity) or retaliation due to your specific gender.",legaladvice,1

"Ok.  This is sort of a ""scam"".  Recently Florida has gotten very strict on monitoring opioid use.  Therefore, physicians are doing urine drug screens to cover their butts.  Usually the doctor does a qualitative test in the office that tells if a particular substance is present in the specimen. This looks for the drug prescribed as well as drugs not prescribed.  From there the doctor sends it to a lab for a quantitative test.  This test shows the individual drug and/or drug metabolite with high specificity and better sensitivity.  For that test, they charge a darn fortune.  However, there is good news.  Often the doctor has a ""deal"" with the lab that they will not charge over a certain amount and sometimes nothing at all except for what the insurance pays.  It is likely your mother's doctor has some kind of deal with the lab because if they are billing 11K to all her patients, she is going to be losing a lot of them.  I would suggest your first call would be to the doctor's office.  Not billing, ask for the clinic.  They know the ""sales rep"" from the lab and can work on your behalf.  Explain that your parents are indigent and you  need as much of this written off as possible.  Ask for the sales reps name if you don't get anywhere with the doctor's office.  If you PM me the lab, I may be able to give you more information.  This is big business around Florida right now BUT they are rarely going after the patients, just the insurance companies.

"Alright these things happen, take it easy. The problem here, guy, is that unless OP is an informant or cop or otherwise obligated to involve the law with this he's looking for trouble, with a family member nonetheless. It's a reckless recommendation that will destroy whatever is left of the family dynamic. Do you think every person who abuses their medication should have the police called on them by the people closest to them? That you defend BETRAYAL - from some moral standpoint nonetheless (oh it's illegal) speaks to the type of person you are. Hopefully your wife calls the cops on you next time you have a beer and drive home (incidentally a million times worse than diverting your own drugs).

This took place at a college in Maine. So a friend of mine's girlfriend had gained a lot of weight recently, like 10-15 lbs because of her antidepressants. So he offered to pick up the prescription for her and switched them out with his adderall and told her they had given her a generic form this time so the pills looked different. Only she got suspicious when the pills made her feel too good and she googled the markings on the pill (apparently you can do that?) She broke up with him and threatened to call the police. I'm not condoning what he did I know it was really really stupid but how much trouble could he get in for something like this if she called the cops? Could she prove it? He got his adderall back and had already tossed the antidepressants as soon as he got them from the pharmacy. Serious replies only.",legaladvice,1

"Just FYI, there are a lot of idiots/trolls in the thread, so be wary of the advice being given. A lot of people are jumping on the anti-rape bandwagon.

I see 2 basic ways to approach this. One is you treat it like a a case could developed, and two is you don't.

I can think of many times in life where something illegal was resolved by talking with the other party, and coming to a mutual understanding. In many of those cases, a LACK of just that could have escalated the situation.

So one strategy is to avoid this growing by trying to keep the ""victim"" calm, and showing you understand your mistake, and are sorry., and will not repeat that mistake or something similar with someone else in the future.

The other strategy, is to never talk to anyone about anything, including the police, and especially to call a lawyer if you are ever arrested.

The problem with society is that girls are the gate-keeper of sex, and sex is often the only place where they ALWAYS have more power. Sex is their domain. This leads to problems like this, where even simple things can be easily used against you.

My question is can the principal bar me from prayer in this manner? Isn't this against my religious rights?

You're misunderstanding OP's post and you are objectively wrong. No amount of blathering is going to change what is written in the post. OP want to physically go to a Mosque on Fridays due to his religion, the principal wants him to stay in a detention in a class at the school. OP might be more traditional than most Muslims and feel that going to a Mosque is preferable to praying alone. The detention is interfering with OP's ability to practice his/her religion. There is no real reason why the detention cannot be served on a day which is not Friday but the principal is insisting that it be served on a Friday.

"Cops can ask, but if they have no evidence of a crime in progress they need to either find one or frame you for one before they can arrest you.

Using the 5th amendment is in no way any admission of guilt. 

However, cops will break the law whenever it is convenient, framing you is standard operating procedure. America has more people in prison than any other modern nation. More people in solitary than France, Germany, England and Australia combined have in prison. Cops now take more than criminals using civil forfeiture laws to steal property without any crimes having been committed.

The law can theoretically protect you if you know your rights, but all cops are crooks. Don't piss them off and let your lawyer work it out afterwards.

They WILL shoot you. The WILL frame you. They WILL use intimidation. They WILL retaliate. They are almost never held to any accountability. Cops are indicted at nearly 0%, while same court indicts non-cops at nearly 100%.

"Story time.  I was 21 years old dating an 20 year old girl.  She drove into Manhattan to see me and we spent 20 minutes looking for a spot.  Finally, we found one and she started to parallel park... Except she didn't do a good job and kept making attempt after attempt at it.  I got out and tried to help her but she kept doing the thing where she turns the wheel after she started moving instead of before.

After her fifth attempt, she zooms off leaving me in the parking apace.  Her reasoning was that she wanted to come around the block again.  This made no sense as she didn't need to do that to reset from scratch.  Meanwhile, of course, someone else sees this parking spot with me standing in it and immediately attempts to take it.  I yell that my GF is right behind him and he ignores me and starts to back up.  I tell him I am not moving.  He still ignores me.  He then hits me with his car.  It was nothing but a nudge and didn't knock me down but I immediately punched my fist down on his trunk.

He came out of his car and started yelling at me.  A cop car happened to come by at that moment.  He told them that I had hit his car with my fist denting it and I refused to leave HIS parking space.  I then mentioned to the cops that he had used his car to nudge me out of the way.  The cop immediately told him that he was clearly in the wrong and to leave asap.  My GF got the space, but i honestly couldn't date her for much longer after that.  The fact that she left me and the spot we had searched so long to find, to drive around the block instead of just resetting the car (it was a 2 lane not busy road), made no sense.

Humans are TERRIBLE test subjects. We lie, we cheat, we grow slowly, we reproduce slowly, and it's very difficult to give us cancer or disease in a controlled fashion.

This same doctor (no longer practicing I assume) had done a hysterectomy on my mom some years earlier.

Before my mom's surgery she made a joke asking if he could take out her appendix too while he was at it.

In reality, you just need to satisfy to the CBP officer that you are a US citizen., If you are a US citizen then you can cross. In fact, if you are a US citizen, they have to allow you to cross. 

As crazy as this sounds, just two weeks ago I took a friend to San Diego from Baja. He told me he had a passport, halfway through the 5 hour jounrey he told me it was expired. As we were waiting in line in the car, he handed me a photocopy of his expired passport. I was thinking oh sh*t. This is gonna be a real problem. It wasn't. The CBP officer didn't even bat an eye. It was just a routine crossing. The funny thing is that this friend has told me that he once crossed with nothing, no ID whatsoever. I wouldn't have believed him if we didn't have such an easy time crossing with a bad photocopy of an expired US passport. I know some of you will downvote this because it is such an incredibly unbelievable story, but it really happened at the Tecate crossing. 

I've got another friend who crosses every few weeks and he has used his driver's license on several occasions. I know he did this for sure because he had applied for a passport and had to turn in his old passport and passport card. 

I have another person who I am helping to get her and her daughter passport cards. The daughter was born in Mexico and is 14 years old. The mother has had to enter the US but only has an old California ID card. I know that she has crossed the border with just that. She was not detained at all. They entered her ID card into the system and let her enter. She is half Japanese so she doesn't even look ""American""..whatever that means.

That's what happens when you leave a woman pregnant. Other men step up. I bet your ex felt pretty overwhelmed when you left, too.

You are *not* a member of *their* family. You are on the outside. Your determination to interfere to the point you won't ""allow them to be fully a family together"" does indeed sound awfully selfish.

"&gt; It was my roommates that I spoke with when I moved in. I have never met the owner.

Then your roommate is your de facto landlord. You have a tenancy relationship with him, and he has a tenancy relationship with the landlord. You don't necessarily need to worry about whether or not he's paying the landlord, so long as you keep receipts/records of what you pay him. (If the landlord has given him free reign over the property, he can charge you rent and pocket the money himself, for example.)

As landlord, this also means that roommate/landlord has to follow [all the laws of being a landlord for your state](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/overview-landlord-tenant-laws-new-jersey.html) *and*  in your city, whatever that city is.

Can he make you sign a lease? No. But the real question is, can he end your month-to-month tenancy if you do not? That's a maybe. New Jersey has [certain rules](http://www.state.nj.us/dca/divisions/codes/publications/pdf_lti/evic_law.pdf) [PDF] for such things. Rules that are uncommon elsewhere in the US. So he *might* be able to kick you out (using proper legal procedures of course) if you do not agree to sign a lease with him.

Another poster has recommended contacting the owner of the house. This is a tricky situation that could backfire on you, but if you're being faced with an eviction (legal or otherwise) it might be worth it to take that risk. Your location may have legal aid clinics for tenants, you can consult with them, but they are likely to ask some of these same questions, namely, what is the relationship between the roommate/landlord and the homeowner.

"[Here](http://www.newyorkrealestatelawyersblog.com/2014/10/surrender-of-lease-agreements-in-new-york.html) is a link to a lawyer in New York outlining that surrendering the key should be a standard requirement in the lease for vacating it. I don't know if the state law explicitly says they have to, but the state law certainly doesn't prevent it being a requirement in the lease. I suppose I could have worded my above response better, but the point is unless you're sure of the laws in Michigan which state a key surrender CAN'T be required, I'd be careful in telling op she definitely doesn't have to. 

Furthermore, I don't know if there's an actual law on the books, but (also in New York) I know when I sued my old landlord for my deposit, their claim was that I never surrendered the key on the day I was supposed to move out. The judge seemed to take this seriously, and I explained that the landlord's office was closed on the day I moved out so I left the key on the fridge. The judge found this to be an acceptable defense. 

E: here's another lawyer in New York who basically says ""if you surrender keys, your lease is definitely terminated. If you don't surrender keys, maybe, maybe not, consult a lawyer"" 

https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/upon-moving-out-landlord-is-insistent-that-i-sign--1539715.html

I don't think it's as simple as you're making it out to be. I think op should use one of the many, many options at her disposal to surrender the keys instead of playing games about it. She can mail them, she can leave them at the office, she can leave them in the house.

What about ADA requirements? All these things and more go into the determination of what is appropriate and LEGAL in your jurisdiction.

If he wins, his expenses in bringing the claim (like the filing fee) gets added to what you owe. Similarly, if he wins and has to file for garnishment, the fee for that gets added to what you owe. So its not really the barrier you are thinking to sue you in small claims.

If he sues you in small claims court, he needs to serve you with the notice of claim. You need to respond with the proper form

I realize proving negligence will be difficult so we are carefully documenting everything that happens and have a history of communication over the initial matter. 

Also, not sure if we should contact our realtor or home inspector to see what can be done. Not sure what we'd be asking from them to be honest, maybe the realtor company would have attorneys.

As to the days before the new tenant moved in, it seems likely that you were responsible for the time the apartment went unrented.

You could make your argument, he could make his, and a judge could decide.  

You seem to want to take the position he pushed you out early.  Another take may be that you agreed to leave early for your mutual benefit in terms of another tenant taking the property you were contracted for.  

As to the cleaning fees, those are the standard dispute.  You argue that the place was clean.  Landlord argues additional cleaning was needed.  A judge would have to decide who was right.

depends on whether the evidence shows that you vacated or not: had you turned in your keys, what did the apt look like, had you told them you weren't vacating?

but if you want to zing them with that, you will be liable to LL for failing to vacate. and that would mean at _least_ a month's rent for the original apt. if not more since you'd maybe now be held to the notice to vacate requirement which is probably 60 days. ",legaladvice,0

So take some notes and photos (if you have any bruises or other injuries), and keep track of your medical expenses and the replacement costs of your glasses and damaged clothes.   It will be helpful to have a concise statement of your damages.

"~~You're asking for complicated legal advice from people completely unqualified to give it.  You're best bet would be to speak to an immigration lawyer.  That being said, I'll do my best.~~ EDIT: wtf, I thought this was r/canada


First off, you did what you were asked to do by the CBSA.  Leaving on time and submitting the paperwork earns you a check mark.  If you want to return to Canada to visit your boyfriend for a couple of weeks, make sure you have a return ticket and enough funds to cover your stay.  You probably will get in just fine.


If you have a real desire to stay in Canada for good, quit the bullshit.  Lying at the border will only hurt you in the long run.  File in advance for the proper visas.  A quick check at immigration [website](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/eligibility.asp) shows that your best bet to get a long term visa is either through school or work.  You should either transfer to a Canadian school or get a job here.  Marrying your bf and having him sponsor you may also work, but I think the other two are better, they give you options if the LDR now NDR doesn't work.


In the end though, its all up to the guards at the border.  Answer any questions they give you truthfully and completely, but don't answer questions they don't ask.  If you bring up with prior issue but they hadn't even asked about it won't do you any favors.",legaladvice,0

"No. No one would care that you claimed it was a prank. No one would care (less than they otherwise would) if your victim got away or wasn't actually, physically harmed. Yes, it would be attempted kidnapping; yes, it would be assault; yes, it would be impersonating an officer; yes, in many states they would also charge you with attempted rape, since it's no secret that you're stalking this girl and have uncontrollable and unrequited sexual/romantic feelings towards her.

Stop it. What you feel isn't love, it's lust. Lust goes away. Love is something that builds up *between two willing and agreeable people* over weeks, months, and years. You have nothing here with this girl. She doesn't love you, she doesn't even like you -- and if you have any respect for her at all, if your feelings for her have any meaning at all, you will not do something to hurt her, and what you're doing now, even just thinking about her this way, is hurting her.

Be yourself. Get constructive hobbies. Learn to like yourself. Make friends with people who like you. When you do that, you will find someone who does love you without you even trying to look for them. Trust me, every teenage boy has felt the way you felt at some point or another -- you're just taking it way too far down a very dark path. 

I hope you listen to me because otherwise you are going to get in trouble, and you will get a bad reputation and then you will always be alone. You may feel powerless because this one girl doesn't reciprocate your feelings, but she's just one girl -- you have the power to be a better person who doesn't go down this path and who ends up in a good place.

I had a bunch written and then deleted it after rereading your post.

There is a contradiction in your OP.  Is he getting a modification aka HAMP, or a new mortgage and HELOC?

Either way, doesn't really matter in regards to your question tho, because you are not part of the fraud at this point.  Breaking the checks into bimonthly payments isn't going to cause you be apart of it and is a silly request.  Get it is writing, just in case, so he can't claim that you are not paying in full at the beginning of every month  (since that is the standard).

If he asks you to sign a letter, then come back, because depending on what is says that could fall into you assisting with the fraud.",legaladvice,0

"Former teacher here.  I agree 100% with this.  We had plenty of *parents like this* in a rural area, too.  

I'm annoyed, but not totally surprised, that OP thinks that if he/she doesn't sign the paperwork from the school, that this child can just go back to class.  The entitlement in the post is mind boggling.

OP, Your child is hampering the learning of others.  She has no right to disrupt a class by yelling ""at her teacher for quite a while"", and then assaulting another student.  

In four years or so she may be entering the workplace, where such behavior could easily bring police intervention.  If I were the parents of the child who was shoved I might consider calling the police tonight, depending on whether there were injuries.

I have no idea if she needs a special placement or not.  Before you spend any more money on specialists, OP, be sure that you are being supportive of the school that she is presently attending.  Instead of making excuses for her violent outburst, give her some *real consequences* at home, too, while she is suspended.
