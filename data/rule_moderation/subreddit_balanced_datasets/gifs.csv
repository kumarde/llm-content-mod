Their dumb little feelings had very little to do with it. The left was stupider though if that makes you feel better. The left thought they could run someone currently involved in a corruption scandal, who has a 30 year history of being involved in corruption scandals, and who is deeply unpopular, and that she would just win because that's what the DNC wanted. Fucking retarded. In retrospect, it was the dumbest, most delusional political blunder in recent memory.

"These Canadian Eskimo dogs are owned by a man (Brian Ladoon) who baits polar bears, and then photographs the bears ""playing"" and ""snuggling"" with the dogs. Meanwhile, notice that the dog is chained? ALL the dogs in photos like these are mauled by the bears shortly after the photographs are taken. Unfortunately, Ladoon has made quite a living off selling his photographs to unknowing tourists who don't realize the real situation. Here is an excellent description: http://mytraveltales.com/2008/11/13/update-on-polar-bears-and-dogs/ It's an incredibly controversial topic, and many people are trying to stop Ladoon from killing off so many dogs that he can't sell to tourists. Horrifically, there's actually a documentary that's been made about how Ladoon is a ""hero"" to be trying to save this endangered ""species"" of dog (didn't realize that every breed of dog constituted a new species...): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGFkWqC82a4 The other issue with the polar bear population in Churchill (the western Hudson bay subpopulation) is that it is incredibly humanized. Every bear in this region has had some kind of contact with human beings, and they are very much aware of the association of food and human, having had plenty of experience and teaching their young to behave in similar ways. Anyway, the point being: these photos are NOT cute, and people need to pay attention to the situation at hand in an effort to respect wildlife.",gifs,1

"Welcome to KUSHIYU RESTAURANT the best Sushi restaurant in Tarzana. Our mission is to be the best asset of our community through the dining experience at “Kushiyu” by giving our customer the fun and surprise.
We always try very hard to get the freshest, safest, and highest quality foods which are available on the market with least expensive price on the day, so we can make sure our customers get the best food with reasonable price. That is why we go to the market almost every morning to hand pick the fish, produce, poultry, etc. We are not relying on frozen or delivery food much, like many other restaurant does. And we are very strict about food safety since our business is based on our customer’s trust and we are enforcing it for more than 25 years at this location. And we believe that is why we have so many repeat customers who know the difference coming back to our restaurant for years. Our chef has been educated to keep our food as safe and fresh as possible , and all of our food handlers have food handler certificate. Our price is not that expensive compare with the other restaurant where serves the same kind of quality food. You can check the quality of our ingredients on https://www.facebook.com/Kushiyu https://twitter.com/ShawnKushiyu http://www.yelp.com/biz/kushiyu-tarzana",gifs,1

"That law applies to MILITARY PERSONNEL and not SECRETARIES OF STATE.  Hence UCMJ: the Uniform Code of MILITARY Justice.  The FBI is a quasi independent organization, and the current head of the FBI was not appointed by Obama.  Decisions by the Supreme Court have to be enforced by the president AND congress, which is again, entirely Republican controlled, and if they could do anything to prosecute Clinton they would've.  Besides, it's not the job of the SCOTUS to prosecute a Federal Agent, that would be left up to the FBI to investigate, and a Federal Prosecutor to prosecute.  It may even have fallen to a congressional committee to indict her, which again, would've been Republican lead, and she would've been thrown in jail.  You know why none of that happened?  Because everyone in the positions I mentioned above know she did nothing illegal and they have no case.

Wiki:

&gt;432 Park Avenue is a supertall residential skyscraper in Manhattan, New York City. Originally proposed to be 1,300 feet (396 meters) in 2011, the structure topped out at 1,396 ft (426 m). Construction began in 2012 and was completed on December 23, 2015. The building has been much maligned by many city residents who find it an eyesore and believe it represents New York's increasing cost of living and ostentatious wealth.

&gt;The building required the demolition of the 495-room Drake Hotel. Built in 1926, it was purchased for $440 million in 2006 by developer Harry Macklowe and razed the next year. Its footprint became one of New York's most valuable development sites due to its location, between East 56th and 57th Streets on the west side of Park Avenue.",gifs,0

The cyclist was in danger of hitting the pedestrian. Getting run over by a bicycle is plenty dangerous even if it's not nearly as dangerous as getting hit by a car. The pedestrian has the total right of way in a crosswalk and the cyclist wasn't able to pass at that speed without being in danger of hitting the pedestrian. This is why the cyclist should have slowed down or stopped.,gifs,0

WWII is the reason the UN has Article 13 which says that you must accept refugees. If you're a UN member state, you signed the UN Charter.

"A president is not a singularity. There are familial, political, professional, personal relationships involved. An administration can be swayed, obligated, or endeared to a nepotistic outcome. Nepotism isn't literally just, ""Son, Gerald is more qualified for this job but you're going to get it because you're my kid."" It's special treatment and considerations due to advantageous connections in general. And it is most certainly something to consider when electing politicians.",gifs,0

Except the spandex type cyclist ... We have so many of them here, and most of them think they own the road and can do whatever they please.

Once one of them was so startled by my car coming right at him (only it was far away from him, and he just didn't notice me), that he hit the curb at slow speed and fell off his ""horse"", only to begin complaining to me, how I could dare to use the same road as him ...",gifs,0

"Not at traffic lights.  At traffic lights, the traffic, i.e. things with wheels that are moving along the road like cars and, yes, bikes, is obliged to fully stop at red lights.  It's not OK for cyclists to just ignore the lights any more than it is for cars to do so.  They have to stop.  What you're quoting probably refers to pedestrians crossing somewhere other than a crossing with lights (mid-street or a pelican crossing etc.).

"No dude.  Wrong.  Well, not *wrong*, but melodramatic AF

As I said, I was cautious, courteous, vigilant, and mindful of others.  There was never an occasion when I came remotely close to bumping into someone.   This was not luck or happenstance, it was me slowing down considerably for blind/less than open corners.  It was me slowing down to a crawl if I needed.  It was me aware of my surroundings and actually paying attention.

They way I rode, it would have been far easier and faster for me to use the road. Far less stopping, starting, or giving way.  But far more dying that way, too.",gifs,0

Stop motion is an animation technique that physically manipulates an object so that it appears to move on its own.
