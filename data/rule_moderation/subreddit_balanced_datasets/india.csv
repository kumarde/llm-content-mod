"मोदी  का  विरोध  क्यों ???
● क्या मोदी कोई  विदेशी है जो बाहर से आकर प्रधानमंत्री की कुर्सी पर जबरदस्ती बैठ गए हैं ?
● क्या मोदी का चरित्र दागदार है  ?
● क्या मोदी ने कोई भ्रष्टाचार किया है ?
● क्या मोदी अपनी तिजोरी भर रहे हैं नेहरू-गांधी परिवार की तरह  ?
● क्या मोदी का कोई बेटे-भतीजे-भाई-भौजाई को लाभ देने में लगे हैं ?
● क्या मोदी की विश्वसनीयता संदेह के घेरे में है ?
● क्या मोदी राष्ट्रविरोधी कार्य कर  रहे हैं ?
● क्या मोदी कामचोर है ?

स्वयं से ये सवाल करने पर हर बार  अंतर्मन  जवाब देगा - ""नहीं-नहीं"".
तब मोदी से एलर्जी क्यों ?? 

अल्पज्ञानी आरोप लगाते हैं कि-
(1) राम मंदिर नहीं बनवाया
(2) धारा 370 नहीं हटाया 
(3) PDP से गठबंधन किया
(4) 15  लाख नहीं दिये
(5) अच्छे दिन नहीं आए

तो ये बताओ कि - 
1. तुम्हें सभी विषय में 100% नंबर मिले थे ?
2. पहली नौकरी लगते ही घर खरीद लिया ?
3. पांचवा तल्ला पहले बनाया या मजबूत नींव पहले बनाई ?
4. पांचवा गियर पहले लगता है कि या पहला ?

उदाहरण और भी जोड़ सकते हैं.......

कोई नहीं बताता कि अगर मोदी नहीं तो कौन ??

कौन बना सकता है स्थायी सरकार ?
कौन बनवा सकता है राम मंदिर ?
कौन हटवा सकता है धारा 370 ?
कौन करवा सकता है किसानों की सुरक्षा ?
कौन कर सकता है भारत की रक्षा ?

एक साजिश है लुटेरों की, ताकि आप फंस जाएं, और इनको लूटने को मिले...

मई  2014 से आज तक सारे चोर चुहार, देशद्रोही, आतंकी टाईप के लोग क्यों पगलाए हैं ?

जरा  सोचिए !

अगर आपने आज मोदी का साथ नहीं  दिया तो जैसे वाजपेयी सरकार के जाने के बाद सोनिया की ग़ुलामी 10 साल करनी पड़ी थी अबकी बार शायद 100 साल से भी ज्यादा करनी  पड़ेगी। खून के आँसू रोना पड़ेगा। सोचें... 

हमने अपने देश की बागडोर मोदी जी जैसे एक ऐसे मजबूत और ताकतवर व्यक्ति के हाथ में दी है जो देश के 125 करोड़ हिन्दुस्तानियों के भविष्य के बारे में 24 घंटे सोचते हैं और उनके  भविष्य को संवारने के लिए निरंतर कार्य कर रहे हैं।

मीडिया और लोगों का विरोध सुन कर भी वो देश के भविष्य के लिए कार्य कर रहे हैं । 

अपने लिए नहीं ; 
हमारे भारत के स्वर्णिम भविष्य के लिए जी रहे हैं।

गर्व करें कि आप मोदी समर्थक हैं, कोई इटली की टीम के गुलाम नहीं, या चीन का साथ देने वाले वामपंथी नहीं, न ही अन्ना हजारे के साथ भारत माता की जय बोलकर सीएम बनने वाले, और आज भारत माता की जय नहीं बोलने को जायज ठहराने वाले किसी के चेले नहीं। 

दस लोगों को शेयर करें, दुष्प्रचार करने वालों को तो पैसा मिलता है,  देश से उनको कोई मतलब नहीं, पर आप  सुप्रचार करें, आप सुप्रचार करें तो  हमारा-आपका देश सुरक्षित रहेगा, और आनेवाली आपकी पीढियाँ  एक जगद्गुरु भारत की संताने होंगी।

राजेश पाइलट की कार को एक रहस्यमय ट्रक टक्कर मारकर गायब हो गया और जितेन्द्र प्रशाद बरेली के सर्किट हॉउस में मर गए ?? 

🙊 इसके पहले सोनिया को चुनौती देने वाले सीताराम केसरी को पार्टी से भगा दिया गया?

🙊 राहुल गाँधी के लिए खतरा साबित हो रहे माधवराव सिंधिया एक प्लेन एक्सीडेंट में मारे गए जबकि उनका प्लेन ब्रांड न्यू था और उसमें कोई समस्या नहीं थी और किसी भी मौसम में उड़ने वाला सिस्टम लगा था। 

🙊 काँग्रेस और विदेशी कम्पनियों के लिये खतरा बन चुके ""राजीव दीक्षित"" की मौत हो गई। राजीव भाई की मृत्यु की खबर किसी भी मीडिया चैनल ने नहीँ दिखाई। 

मित्रो, जो भी इस परिवार अत्याचारों के खिलाफ आवाज उठाता है उसकी रहस्यमय हालात में मौत हो जाती है ?? शशि थरूर की पत्नी भी इस बात का उदाहरण है।

All the jobs in the Mechanical , aero and EE domains are mainly found in defence contractors like Lockheed , GD , Boeing. These jobs typically requires a clearance from  DoD and a PR. Therefore there is a massive competition for those jobs, in tech industries,  that hire international students.

Well, if they can take a stand against a terror attack in Paris. They should be taking one against in India too, especially Kashmir. Uri attack doesn't help Kashmir in the slightest, it would only lengthen the ASFPA and increase the Army deployment. 

>How offensive is it to demand Pakistani actors to be sorry for a terrorist attack like they are guilty or need to be absolved or something?

Indians are offensive deal with it. They are honest about their actions. As representatives of Pakistani culture they should be presenting model attitude to show solidarity with those killed and their families like they did in Paris attacks that had no affect on them. 

>This over an attack which was not by the Pakistani army.

There is no need to oppose Pakistani army. It is about terrorists. Pakistani army isn't involved. They don't need to take stance against Pakistani army, just terrorists.

Perfectly put. I agree 100% with your review of the movie, although I would also mention two other things in the movie that were really good–

* Sushant Singh Rajput's acting: you would say Bihari guy playing a Bihari isn't too hard, but still he was very authentic. He really must have put in a lot of work to copy all those shots and mannerisms of Dhoni.

So I say go for a potato mutton curry served on top of rice. 

Just copied this off of the interwebz, just take it as a guide and use the ingredients you have and you'll get a good meal out of it.


Clean and wash mutton pieces. Drain water and keep it aside.

Heat oil and ghee in a fry pan. Add cardamom, cloves, black pepper corns, cinnamons and bay leaves.

Saute for a minute. Add finely chopped onion and salt.

Saute till the onion turns light brown.

Add ginger garlic paste and cook till the raw smell disappears.

Now add turmeric powder, red chilly powder and coriander powder.

Combine well and add mashed tomatoes.

Cook until the tomatoes turn pulpy and oil separates out from the masala.

Add the mutton pieces and mix well.

Cook in medium flame for 4 to 5 mins, stirring once in a while. Add yogurt and mix well.

Cook further for 4 to 5 minutes more. Now add 2 cups of water. Stir well.

Taste and adjust salt and seasonings. Add freshly chopped coriander leaves.

Add garam masala powder and mix well.

Transfer the masala into the pressure cooker and pressure cook for 4 whistles and simmer for 10 to 12 mins. (The mutton should be cooked till it becomes tender and juicy).",india,0

"I am going to get downmodded to oblivion for going against groupthink, but what the heck.

You are mixing up two very different things. China has a rapidly (not slowly) aging population which is singularly because of their one child program.

Second, their economic prosperity and health has really grown, which has taken them from third world country levels to second world country levels.

But these are not related. The reason for China's success has been their extremely far seeing (visionary) economic policies, focus on world beating manufacturing, superb transportation and logistics, and relentlessly improving trade.

It is only more recently when they have started fo using on improving education, health etc. But this, or the one child policy has nothing to do with their economic prosperity.

If you ask for the blueprint for India's future economic success, it will all be about privatization, deregulation, reducing interference from bureaucrats and politicians. And building up infrastructure like ports, roads, electricity, water, making cities efficient, etc. And letting Indian companies survive and thrive without needing to have license raj type ""connections"" and ghooskhori of insane levels.

All of this has very little to do with population growing, especially in the cow belt Bimaru states.

Mind you, i am not saying that a growing unemployed population is not a burden. I am saying that it is a problem but NOT the noose around the country's neck that is the whole and sole reason preventing the country from ""becoming successful like China"". At least that is how the groupthink portrays this to be.

Tl;dr - If you make a list of top 10 things that are preventing our country from ""becoming successful like China"", then population growth is not even in the top 5. But for some reason, it is seems to be the favorite reason touted by everyone as the whole and sole reason for all our problems.",india,0

"1. Prohibition of alcohol is in the State's domain under Schedule VII of the Constitution. Basically the center or courts can't do jack. If a state wants to ban alcohol, it can ban the fuck out of it.

2. Technically, there were two laws. There was the OLD law which was the old bihar prohibition and excise law, which was overturned by the Patna High Court recently. The law was not amended by the legislature, but rather, through a notification issued by the executive. Typically, the executive branch can do this for temporary periods if the enabling legislation permits the amendment of the law without following the legislative process(I have not read the Old prohibition law, so I am not sure if the Govt could technically amend the same, although I presume that it is permissible.) The logic being that it gives the state executive (itself formed under the blessing of the legislature)  the power to amend the law when assembly is not in session. I guess Patna HC threw out the old law because of the draconian criminal penalties. 

3. The NEW law is a new Act in itself, passed by the legislature. This  repeals the old law and replaces it. Therefore, the new law will have to be challenged afresh in the courts as it is different from the old law. The process of passing the New law and enacting it was already in process even before the Patna HC threw out the old law. 

Therefore, for a day or two, while the Patna HC judgement was effective, Bihar was effectively a wet state, only to be made dry again after the enacting of the New law.

" May be not Sweden, no less than Amartya Sen himself, pointed out in his book,""An Uncertain Glory: India and its Contradictions"" , pointed out that ""Tamil Nadu (and Kerala) would be at the top of South Asian comparisons in social indicators if they were treated as separate countries"". After all, 20% of the population contributes a full 30% of India's tax revenues. This is the money that runs the country.The South also delivers a fourth of India's GDP.a per capita GDP that is over double that of the Hindi belt aka ""cow belt"".In return we just get paltry 18% of funds allocated back from the centre. 
In my part of the world (in your words , first world utopia) this literally means we are feeding lazy states aka the job of first world countries. Bam! you are right after all.suck it.  I know its difficult to swallow,  the truth is the cow belt states indeed  are dragging us down. we are stuck in this melee.
 I am sorry for being blunt here, the ""cow belt"" is never going to improve. Because, cow Belt North India=Pakistan basically. The way people behave (read:uncouth), even the looks and what not  I can't tell apart a Pakistani and a cow belt North Indian. Actually, you belong two together.
India is now where it is mainly because of the southern states. Southern states are the ""antidote"" to all the filth  going on in the cow belt--from communal barbarianism to corruption. In return, we are not only getting less funds but tags like ""Rape nation"". Not that rape doesn't happen in south, but the rapes in ""cow belt"" states area kind of its own. 

If this is too much for you to comprehend, I'll give you a simple example. Take two prominent institutions of India--Indian Railways and ISRO. ISRO right from its genesis to this day purely dominated by South indians and the result --the whole world was gobsmacked  when third world country India was successful in MOM. OTOH, Indian railways, lol , traditionally dominated by North Indians , the abject mess that is Indian railway is legendary!Any foreign tourist ,  who comes to India, the major impression he/she gets is from the India railways and that impression is shit because Indian railways is shit (quite, literally too).

After Indira Gandhi (and I suppose during her premiership), the party just became a wagon for random 'vote banks' to hitch on to, without any coherent ideology. That was the time when the identity changed to 'Party of the Gandhis'. If I remember correctly Sonia Gandhi lived as a homemaker after Rajiv Gandhi's death and had no inclination of joining politics. It was only at the insistence of the leadership at that time, who did not know what the party would do without a Gandhi at the helm, did Sonia enter active politics.",india,0

"Okay my time to shine. I did 2.5 years at Copenhagen as a student at KU.
 
1) No preferrence really required for accommodation. Good areas if you can afford 4500 DKK+ rent are Christianshan and københavn k area.  Only thing i would advise is avoid the ghettos in Nørrebro and Bronshøj. Living close to work place is your choice. Transport is very good there. Metros and trains run almost 19-20 hrs/day. In case of no metros/trains you have buses which you can catch every hour or hour and half to your place. Use http://www.rejseplanen.dk/ to plane as they are awesome and accurate service. 

2) Racial profiling is not that prominent. Danish folk are good.. But you will encounter it during house searches (I have been denied housing coz i would garlic based cuisine..lol) and maybe a little among the general public. Otherwise in general it's all good. Danish are the utmost professionals in terms of a professional life. With  personal life they are generally reserved so dont take it personally if you aren't invited or they don't discuss family or bf/gf/wife/husband matters with you even if your best buddies with them.

3) Depends on your salary and lifestyle. Taxes are crazy there. if you're earning more than 40000DKK/month prepare to more than 50% in taxes. below that it comes upto 38-42%.

4) Being a vegetarian is very very tough. Learning to cook is the best choice. Not even Mcdonalds has a veg option outside of salad and fries. Thai food and Indian restaurants you're best bet for eating outside.

5) You say university but you say job as well? Are you a PhD student or have you got a corporate jon? DO NOT buy into the KU bs of helping you, they do shit. Prepare to hunt for your own accommodation after one year as they offer their own places for that long only. Register yourself in housing websites (I dont have the names atm, I can check if you want), the ones which put you on a waiting list. These will take about a year to get you the top of and give you an accomadation but they offer the cheapest prices.

House hunting sucks balls if you're a non-EU especially. Be prepared to have a tough hunt as places below 5000 DKK are like a dream. Alternatively if you're not to worried about house rent you should be fine. 

6) a) LEARN THE LANGUAGE. it is a sole sole requirement if you want to settle there. the part time jobs the better jobs oppurtunities all appear if you know the language. You will integrate better as well. 

You get free language classes for upto 2 years. TAKE IT. wherever you find a house and settle, look into the language centers in that municpality (yes, it's like this) and join it. 

b) carry clothing as much as you can. Winter clothing and windbreakers especially. If you can get coats with fur lining around neck  it would be good. Winter clothign is expensive in københavn. If you intend to survive on maggi, c'mon that's just sad. Learn cooking. The vegetables there are all fresh. Utensils, I would advise a rice cooker, beyond that it should be alright. You will get utensils provided in a university accomodation as you will be sharing kitchen spaces. 

Plenty of indian stores there to hook you up with spices and pickles etc. So dont worry about that part. Also, these guys are good local contacts for information as well. Punjabis dudes and very friendly chaps.

c) car is very very expensive. relearn  cycling... seriously it's your best friend everyone does it and its wonderful to bike there. but from point d) it llooks like youre well off in savings so you could try renting. Or second hand car purchase. I think you get the cheapest at 20k-40k DKK. http://dba.dk is your friend here.

d) dude you will be fine. With that kind of dough, aint going be tough. I dont understand about the moving and settling part? are you looking to purchase furniture and all that ? I mean, if so, look at the local amazon, OR THE ikea store at Taatstrup. http://qxl.dk and http://dba.dk are the local websites for buying exchanging stuff secondhand , if you don't mind it. Cool part of dba.dk is people have to register their social security ID for selling so fraud can't happen much there.

If you want more info, hit me up. I can help out. 

Above else, if you're looking to settle, make sure you integrate through the language, learning culture . Danish are very reserved as a people and interacting with them through hobbies or cultural activities helps to break the ice and help you integrate better there.",india,0

So basically all these groups fundamentally agree that all women have no agency or interest in sex, what they dis-agree on is how much a man should be penalised and the extent of that context in which he should be held guilty. Even as most of these organisations also agree that women can be sexually assertive(and encourage that), the burden of responsibility for any sexual act falls squarely on the man involved(which is a big loophole in itself). This law and the thought behind such laws treats a woman as an inanimate being during sex with no will or desire.",india,0

"You cannot equate killing soldiers vs. killing militias.

Soldiers are expensive. They require robust training which last months (sometime a few years), equipment, resources to be where they are. Soldiers come from foreign states primarily and are stationed far from their homes. Soldiers are not expendables and they need to have their morale high at all times with a purpose and a vision. 

Militias are zealots. They volunteer to fight. They require minimal training to inflict damage. Their loss does not break morale but feeds more zealots.

Soldiers - either they are US/NATO troops, or brutal Pakistani troops in West Pakistan in '71, or Indian troops in Kashmir of the 90s... they are not expendables. The morale of the troops can be easily effected if there are militants hiding amongst the population constantly fighting them in gureilla tactics. 

In the 90s in the height of militancy, it was not uncommon to read articles about Indian soldiers suffering from PTSD, committing suicide and killing fellow mates. [This happens even now, but not as frequently as it did int he 90s](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26352545)

The idea is to keep the soldiers engaged in a perpetual war. And it is tiresome for soldiers who are rational, non-zealot forces who fight against irrational, insatiable, zealots.",india,0

"Unless you give a modus operandi of how corruption can happen with digital trail, I cannot agree with your point. Typically, the middlemen in charge of disbursing relief funds, pensions,etc. hold up payments and make the common man run from pillar to post. And they end up paying a bribe to get that fund released which essentially means a portion of money that is meant for them ends up with the middlemen. 

With JDY, it's mostly automated. There could be fake accounts created and stuff. But digital trail and the number of checkpoints makes it almost impossible to continue this scam without getting caught. 

I come from a family of bankers as well. And I still am not aware of how corruption can happen on a large scale with JDY. I am not saying people won't try. My point is that with JDY, there is a digital trail and anyone who wants to abuse it can be easily tracked down. 

&gt;UBI for 1.2B people is unfathomably large. Even if you give them Rs. 2000 per month (which is still relatively very little), that's still Rs. 28.8 trillion annually (that's 25% of our GDP). There are so many better things to spend that kind of money on, for example education can get massive reforms 

For starters, even if something like this gets implemented, it would be per household (300 million). Second, this is likely to only be deployed for BPL families (100 million). Now 2000 rupees/month is almost the monthly income of a fairly lower income household. UBI is not going to be anything more than 500/month. 

So that makes it around 500 billion. That's around $7.5 billion. Totally affordable. Also, this money is not getting wasted. This triggers consumption and investment from these poor households that creates jobs and reduces poverty.",india,0
