"I once met Frank Ocean at a bar down in Chicago. Frank was sipping on some beer, alone, when I walked over to him and asked for a picture and autograph, to which he said no, in a very angry way. I knew something had to be up with him, so I asked the guy who was my favorite artist of all time what was wrong

‚ÄúThe label is giving me some trouble, being a nag tonight and is always on my nerves, I just need to release Boys Don't Cry (was around July last year) , I‚Äôm sorry man.‚Äù

He apologized and we shot the shit for several hours, took the picture, and straight up just talked about his life after the hip hop world, his new album, and the music business as a whole. We talked until closing, and we were paying, and that‚Äôs when I thought, what better way to repay my favorite artist of all time, than to pay for his entire tab. I politely suggested that I pay for him, to which he was hesitant, but eventually let me. Frank then shook my hand, and gave me his email, and told me to email him sometime if I ever wanted to come to the studio and chill  or if I wanted to just talk.

So, later that night, I mustered up enough courage and decided to email Frank, and for months upon months, we talked. One day, he invited me out to lunch in New York, and told me the ways of the business and then invited me to his house, and of course I said yes.

So, Frank and I took a road trip, and after countless hours of Frank and I switching between driving, we decided to not go to concert, and to travel the United States, and to make a long story short, for 4 months, Frank and I had a breathtaking man on man affair across the 50 states. From seeing the elegance of Niagara Falls, to the astonishing sight of the Grand Canyon, all the way to traveling across the Golden Gate Bridge, Frank Ocean and I made marvelous gay love across the United States of America.

#[‚Ä¢-Click.. ‚Ä¢-Here.. To ‚Ä¢-Download.. Ty Dolla $ign Leak ‚Ä¢-Album]

##About:

Ty Dolla $ign has announced a new 14-track project titled ""Campaign"" that will be dropping in the near future. News recently broke that Ty$ was working on a third ""Beach House"" project, but in an interview with Hot 97 he revealed there's only one song he knows for sure will be on BH3. As for Campaign, it's pretty much complete and one could argue that it may see the light of day before July's over.


Though it was never reported to be a mixtape by any publications, Ty Dolla $ign clarified today that ""Campaign"" is not a mixtape. Ty$ went on Twitter to call out a fan who referred to the project as a tape. Seeing as the project is 15-tracks in length, it's fair to assume that Atlantic Records is releasing Campaign as Ty Dolla $ign's sophomore studio album.

And the leaked album is available today for free download.



##Tracks list:

1. $Intro

2. $

3. Campaign (feat. Future)

4. $$$ (Where)

5. 3 Wayz

6. Juice

7. Zaddy

8. Hello

9. R&B

It'd be like if a (for example) white UK celebrity publicly called a black American entertainer a 'ni**er' (with the hard R) and made jibes about fried chicken etc.  That person would be super-done in terms of having any sort of career in the US, deservedly so.",hiphopheads,1

"I dont mind rappers going for pop appeal once in a while, happy for him

Edit: anyways this reminds me of the time I saved Young Thug from getting robbed. It was just after one of his concerts I was at, during the concert I was randomly selected to see him backstage after the concert. So I went backstage to Young Thug's room and found it closed. I was getting a little frustrated waiting for him and was about to leave when I heard harsh voices through the door. I put my ear up to the door and heard multiple voices telling someone to give them all the valuables. I stepped back and kicked the door right open. Inside there was four dudes: Young Thug, and three dudes I didn't recognize. Two of them had knives and one of them had a gun. One of the guys with a knife came at me, but I managed to catch his arm mid thrust, and using my elbow to smash on his arm, I disarmed him. I delivered a brutal karate chop to the guys neck and he was on the floor instantly. The second guy with a knife stood there stunned, giving me time to give him a full force uppercut to his jaw, knocking him out instantly. The last guy put his gun to Young Thug's head and threatened to shoot if I didn't surrender. I started talking to him in order to stall for time, when eventually Young Thug took his chance and twisted the gun right out of his hand, and put the gun to the robber's head. He looked at me and said I better leave before the police showed up. I just nodded and said ""Good luck, Young Thug."" And started to walk out, when he told me to stop and said, ""Call me Jeffery, my nigga.""

Rates may not be the correct word. Calm down captain CAPS. The point I'm making is that black on black isn't so unique. Yes it's a problem in impoverished areas like the stories that come out of Chicago. I don't want my brothers killing each other when we're so small a percentage in the country. But pointing out black on black crime ignores issues that lead so many black people to living in impoverished areas. White offenders attack white people at similar percentages. I would be willing to wager that the same would be found across most races. ,hiphopheads,1

Not to take the conversation away from Danny, but Kendrick is the perfect example of someone nurturing their talent to progressively put out albums better than the previous ones (imo).

"Why did you expect Danny to change up how he raps technically, though? His technical style was usually through solid rapping and great punchlines and while I can understand people missing the punchlines I thought that the lyrical content was way better than any Danny Brown project before it which he seemed to have strived for and really enhanced the rapping on Atrocity Exhibition as opposed to XXX. It made me more invested in the togetherness of the album to see what he would move on to talking about next even though he was still rapping about content under the same umbrella. I wasn't really expecting him to go DOOM on us or something because the style of technical rapping doesn't really fit him over the way he uses his voice and his personal feelings to rap powerful verses which tied together with the beats.

Why not...? It literally tells you how many times something has been viewed. Selling a lot just means you have a lot of fans that are willing to pay for your stuff, which is a good thing obviously. But if those fans aren't buying your stuff and you're still getting millions of views, you're still popular.

"In terms of following a theme, most of DOOMs album have some sort of supervillain/cartoon idea surrounding them. Stuff like Madvillainy, Mm... Food, and Operation:Doomsday are all about DOOM just being an evil hip hop super villain and are all 10/10 in my book. Take Me To Your Leader is mainly from the perspective of an alien coming to earth and making a album based on his interpretation of music/rap. Vaudeville Villain and Venomous Villain are from the perspective of a younger ~18 time traveling version of DOOM, who's also some sort of mad scientist. There's not really a cohesive narrative with a beginning, middle, and end, but they all follow a central theme. 

If you're looking for albums with great stories throughout, check out Masta Ace. A Long Hot Summer, Disposable Arts, and The Falling Season are all dope albums with fleshed out narratives. Most of the individual songs are incredible too, and there are mini stories in some of those. ",hiphopheads,0

We supported him so much, I would sneak into all my friends computers and download HoB, but he was a rolling stone and he doesn't need us anymore because he is the biggest pop star in the world now
