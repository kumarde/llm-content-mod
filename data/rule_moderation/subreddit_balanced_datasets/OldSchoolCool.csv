"Move goalposts much?

Your argument was basically that people shouldn't have a right to free speech of what they say is offensive, or it preaches violence against others.

This picture is of a man holding a flag, while an older woman assaults him.

[a] is preaching violence worse than violence itself?

[b] are you not preaching violence by advocating violence against someone whose opinion is obviously one of which you do not approve, i.e., assaulting a person is ok if they are nazi/skinhead/kkk?

Let that sink in for a minute.  The point I'm trying to make is that free speech is a right afforded to everyone, as long as it is non-violent in the manner in which it is performed.

">One of the most famous pieces of Nazi propaganda was the use of the book Germay Must Perish!, a nonfiction work by a Jew calling essentially for the extermination of the German people. This book was used by Nazis over and over again to make the argument that Jews wanted total conversion of Germans or their death. 

A book published in 1941 long after the Nazis went on their gas the kikes European tour. The book also wasn't the holy book of the jewish religion and the perfect unquestionable word of god. Yeah just a slight difference between it and the koran. 

>Don't forget that the beginning of Kristallnacht and the Holocaust was brought about by the Reichstag Fire.

LOL no. The beginning of the Holocaust was brought about by centuries of Europeans hating the successful jews who lived among them. The jews didn't suddenly invade Europe by the millions and apply for welfare while blowing up the local eating establishment and raping the local women. Again just slight differences.

You're hung up on the wrong aspect, the forceful aspect commonly associated with fascism. PS it's nonsensical to suggest that the Left is more fascist than the right, and goes right along with you comparing fascism to communism when they are diametrically opposed ideologies.

"Yes, Auschwitz is a large place. But that doesnt take away the fact that a day is 1440 minutes and the Allies claim that the Germans have gassed ""6000 people"" a day. It's literally impossible to do that in Auschwitz. Carring out the bodies and cremation of 2-5 hours takes TIME. Keeping a fire in a massgrave alive in POLISH WINTER in the 1940's...is fucking impossible and they wont spend the money to do that. They have been freaking digging around that area and cant find jackshit. 

And besides why the fuck would they do the most expensive and timeconsuming way of murdering these Jewish people? Why not put them all on a row infront of a massgrave, put a knife into their neck and move on? Gassing is stupid, and Germans are by no means stupid and cant afford gassing people during wartime. People who died, died due to starvation because of the war and typhus + other diseases. 

Zyklon B was used to disinfect clothes from typhus that was spreading over the camps. Thats a fact that it's used for those kind of causes.

Cant you explain the reason by having doorhandles inside the gas-chambers, the wooden-door to the chamber, the air leaking windows, the brick-building and the lightbulb in the ceiling purpose? This instead of talking about nonsense and made up bullshit? ""200 times lower"" ...like, get outta here with that nonsense. If you put 2000  people in a fucking room you gotta use shitton of Zyklon B it's just how it is... And one snap on that freaking lightswitch and the place explodes, thats just how it is man. It makes NO sense.

And how do you know they tried to destroy evidence? Because the allies said so? Lol, the winners write and create history.

"> Asian people are the most racist against blacks than any other race, and it's not close.

Is this the guy we are talking about? Because it does not say that all Asian are racist. 

Is it okay to say they are 'racist' vs. 'more racist than...'?? I don't know and neither do I care. Not my strong suit really, those kinds of debates. 

My point was that Asians measured as a group probably(almost certainly) are more racist than Whites as a whole. 

Now if what I said just now is a stereotype then that words means nothing anymore and yes it should be okay!! But if we are talking about my first example then who knows? The morality and ethics of it does not interest me much.

"True. According to the BLS inflation calculator $695 in 1988 is about $1414 today. Don't forget the price of the service -- a friend's father had a cell phone at about the same time and I remember him telling us it was basically at least $20 every time you dialed it, and a $100 phone call was common.

"It was mainly true pre-corset days. That accounts for a long time from Ancient Greece, up until probably around the 20s. 

And it wasn't really that fatness was in vogue, it was fleshiness. Fleshiness was sexually attractive because it was so starkly opposed to what corseted women were like. Put your hand on the waist of a corseted woman and you just feel stiff fabric with little movement. But a woman out of a corset is soft and fleshy and squidgy. So that sort of softness of skin and squidgyness was sexually desirable. Nowadays corsets are not at all common so a harder body achieved through exercise and strict diet is more pleasing for many.",OldSchoolCool,0

"I wonder if at this point JMB had already heard the pretty uniformly  sneering reaction to this collaboration from the press. He was crushed by it apparently, and felt like he had been misled by Warhol, who in turn was accused of (true to form) piggy-backing on Basquiat's young, hip credentials. In truth, the collaborations weren't that great and the two styles that should have worked together ended up looking pretty uninteresting, but I always felt sorry for Basquiat. In particular, he was chewed up and spat out by a world that held him up as the next big thing, only to gleefully shit on him at the soonest possible opportunity. That's how I see this picture but, then again, it's hard to find a picture of Basquiat where he doesn't look a little bit vulnerable.",OldSchoolCool,0

"Of all God's creatures, there is only one that cannot be made slave of the leash. That one is the cat. If man could be crossed with the cat it would improve the man, but it would deteriorate the cat.
Mark Twain


By what right has the dog come to be regarded as a ""noble"" animal? The more brutal and cruel and unjust you are to him the more your fawning and adoring slave he becomes; whereas, if you shamefully misuse a cat once she will always maintain a dignified reserve toward you afterward--you will never get her full confidence again.

(one of my favorites)

A home without a cat — and a well-fed, well-petted and properly revered cat — may be a perfect home, perhaps, but how can it prove title?
