"Has anyone noticed that for the most part, western countries have respect for Asian countries, and for the most part have treated them closet to equal than basically any other race (or in Hitler's case, relgion/race) of people? Not saying there hasn't been conflict, but a lot of it has been fear or retaliatory based conflict and not a superiority complex.

You see this world of hate for anyone from south America (who have darker skin), the middle east, africa, and even some other western countries... but other than in WW2 fighting the Japanese who attacked the Allied countries, and North Vs South Korea, and Pol Pot in Vietnam there hasn't been much against Asian countries. China has always had a tension, but not seen as inferior people wise. Japanese other than WW2, are not looked down upon as inferior (even then they were hated more out of fear.)
I would say one of the closest things to being seen as iferior in an Asian society in modern history was the US in the Phillipines.

Look at Hitlers grandfather denials, in order to call themselves true Arian's Germans had to prove that they were pure German going back to there grandparents but Hitler would not reveal the identity of his paternal grandfather which according to the research I have done on the subject is because he was a Rothschild.

I feel premonitions of the torrent of downvotes I am probably going to receive for saying this but think about it. WW2 allowed great leaps in technology without the boundaries of pesky morals and ethics, council on foreign relations, state of Israel, pretty much every country in the western world drowning in debt. It seems to me the 1% profited immensely from WW2 and as we all should know they are not above orchestrating events to increase there power/wealth and with the right patsy anything is possible which is why I believe ""his story"" tells us that Hitler was the ultimate in evil.

"Well, writing was independently developed in very many part of the world - even in neighbor deprived one like pre-Colombian south America - it usually defines the distinction between history and pre-history and is the tool which allows civilizations to grow, and complex thoughts to be transferred and improved over time.
And even before writing the need of depicting the world was felt independently by non communicating areas of the world.
So, for what concerns your reply on the writing, I believe you are grossly downplaying its importance.

As for the rest I have only to ask you something regarding your last two lines: why it wasn't written down: when a culture reaches a certain complexity writing it down is a necessity. Ever for the knowledge of the land: in form of maps for instance. Even just as drawings (which may or may not develop in pictographic languages - chinese like).

"I can't believe people cite the Crusades as such terrible incidents conveniently forgetting all of the atrocities followers of Islam have committed 563 years ago to today. 

Life for non-Muslims in Constantinople was cruel and terrible. It may have been not so bad if you compare life to the endless hordes of Muslims attacking it of the last years of the empire. The Ottomans were finding their feet and trying to assimilate rather than alienate local populations so they practiced a lot of what they preached, i.e. tolerance. Of course those who had resisted were annihilated.

As time went by things went from bad to worse. The economy stagnated, the local dignitaries prayed on the people, especially non-Muslims who had to pay double taxes.

The daily indignities and restrictions were numerous and often reminiscent of South Africa's apartheid. Non-Muslims could not ride horses, if a Muslim met a non-Muslim on the pavement he was supposed to get off and let him pass, their testimonies in court were accepted in cases between non-Muslims and only rarely against Muslims etc.) Churches had to be smaller than mosques (that were often converted churches RIP Hagia Sophia). They weren't allowed to ring bells. All this paled in comparison to what people feared most though, the abduction of their children: young boys for the Jannisaries, young girls for the harems.    

Thank god the Ottomans retreated and more and more privileges were given to non-Muslims when the European powers and Jews soon controlled most of the trade and amassed huge amounts of money to use as leverage. ",history,1

You should learn how to read, this is the third time you have misread what I have written: I said engineering sciences which are different from engineering. I did not say that I am an engineer, I am an engineering scientist. People in my field figure out how and why materials behave the way they do, create models based on those observations and occasionally develop new materials.

"> You're just making wildly broad generalizations now. In any church?

Its mostly true. You can confirm this by listening to Bart Ehrman's vids on YT. GO read his bio for his qualifications.


> He has sacrifices so much of his life serving those who are needy in his community. Offering them people a place to live, spending countless hours counseling people, waking up at 3am to meet people in crisis.

Your confusing his good actions with proof. There are many muslims also doing charity, that doesnt mean their beliefs are true.

> My father, for example, is one. There is no doubt in my mind that he believes what he is preaching, because he lives it out.

Well i dont know what your father believes nor do i know what he believes exactly but im going to assume for the purposes of this, that he claims to follow Jesus and his teachings.

Lets start with a few easy ones.

* Jesus followed the laws of Moses, he was born, lived and died a Jew.

His apostles continued this tradition, in fact there are many arguments where Peter and the others argue with Paul, that followers of Jesus must also obey Moses.

I know your going to tell me Moses laws are over. The problem with that is jesus never said that, in fact he said the opposite. Go read Mat 5:19 where he says if u want to goto heaven, you should teach and learn moses laws. THat means if Jesus gave ""new"" laws, he was a liar for telling what he said in the above scripture. Another proof of this christian invention, as i mentioned previously the apostles know nothing of jesus commanding to ignore Moses.

When anybody ignores moses laws, and claims to believe they are over, they are obeying the ideas of St Paul, and not Jesus.

> Nearly every apostle was killed for talking about Jesus; they didn't think it was bullshit then. 

The bible doesnt mention the deaths of any apostle. All these claims of the apostles dying for their belief is complete fabrication that has no historical basis, simply because if we examine the traditions, there are many conflicts.

Read up about the ""honesty"" of the relics for Jesus...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relics_associated_with_Jesus

> s? Or the tens of thousands of martyrs throughout the history of the church?

There are thousands of muslims martyrs today as well, thats not a measure of truth, that simply means they were lied too and didnt know better.

Those poor people of the past, had no way of verifying truth, because for starters they were mostly likely poor and they had no access to historical records like we do today. THey had no chance for truth just like the poor Afghan suicide bomber has no chance to know the truth about the world and history except the lies he is brainwashed with.

> By this point I think you are just trolling because there is NO way you can support the claim that most clergy think their faith is bullshit

"Did I claim significant wounds were made?  Significant wounds was a tall order for any non gunpowder weapon.  Pre-gunpowder weapons and combat frequently generated surprisingly few casualties even after several hours of combat.  By far most casualties came after the route when the other side was able to chase down and kill relatively undefended men.  As for the effect of pike on armor, a thrust that connects solidly (which could be easy or hard depending on circumstances) would likely penetrated the armor to make a small wound in the wearer.  Pain, blood loss, and exhaustion would probably do the rest.  My point is that armor does not render its wearer impregnable to pikes.  

Pike armed men frequently slaughtered heavily armed men.  In the 15th century warfare, before hand held gun powder weapon became widespread, there were numerous battles between swiss pike and heavily armored knights which the pike frequently won.  In addition, the front 4-5 ranks of pikemen were heavily armored.  Despite this, pike on pike combat was incredibly brutal.  During the 15th and 16th centuries, this form of combat was called ""Bad War"" for it's high death tolls.  If pikes were not effective against armor, I'm at a loss as to how pikemen repeatably throughout history inflicted crushing defeats against heavily armored foes.  In all my study of late medieval/renaissance/early modern warfare, I have never read an account of heavily armored men penetrating pike walls with impunity.  

Keep in mind is that armor thickness was inversely proportional to its coverage.  A fully proofed breast plate was probably not penetrable to anything but the strongest pike thrust, if even that.  But a fully proofed breast plate usually meant that other parts were less armored, or entirely unarmored.   So the more capable a particular piece of armor was of resisting a pike thrust, the less force you actually needed to injure the wearer with a pike.

Edit:  After rereading my original post, I agree that my original wording was misleading.  I intended ""easily capable of penetrating plate armor"" to mean that it was not unusual for armored men to be injured by pike.  The wording does not reflect my intended meaning.  I have edited my original post. ",history,0

Americans seem to think Hispanic is a race; this is completely incorrect. Most Hispanics in the US happen to be of the indigenous race because most of our Hispanic immigrants come from Central America which has a large indigenous population. But in truth, Hispanics can be of any race. Go down to Miami and you will see most of our Hispanics here are white or black, not indigenous, because Miami Hispanics come from South America or from the Caribbean.

&gt; (...) the said book you try by means of various subterfuges to give the impression of **leaving it undecided and labeled as probable**; this is still a very serious error since **there is no way an opinion declared and defined contrary to divine Scripture may be probable**.

They were not willing to even entertain the idea that it might be probable. Even though Galileo's system was partially flawed and couldn't account the problems pointed out by Brahe by himself, the fact remains that he was threaten with torture for it and made an example for contradicting Holy Scripture in an attempt to stamp out any future dissidence.

"As early as 1622 the Manchu requested that at least half  the troops recruited from Liaodang be armed with muskets and cannon (Nicola Di Cosmo, ""European Technology and Manchu Power"", 2000). How many were actually equipped with the weapons is not clear, but the Qing were definitely working to incorporate more firearms into their forces before 1629.

Kang goes into more detail about this, but Manchu troops struggled against the cossacks early on. Especially when they retreated back inside forts. The Cossacks were defeated in 1654 and 1658 with the help of elite Korean musketeers.

In 1685 the Cossacks at fort Albazin were defeated by the Qing without Korean involvement when Chinese cannon quickly knocked down the fort's wooden walls. Later that year the Cossacks came back and built a much stronger fort in the same spot. When the Qing army came back the defenders held out for 18 months before Russian diplomats arrived in the capital to negotiate a peace treaty.",history,0

"My great great uncle in the war as part of the NSW Bushmen. 

My great uncle was given his first job during the depression sweeping out  this Boer War veteren's store. My great uncle thought the world of his uncle for this. He remembered how his uncle would talk to him about the war as he swept the store out. My grandmother also thought the world revolved around her Boer War veteran uncle.

It was for this reason when my great uncle and I researched our family we did a lot of research on the Boer War and his involvement in it.

From what I remember (it was ten years ago we did this research) the war was a real mess from day one. The British commanders were just plain incompetent and/or insane in my opinion. It is also the first war that Australia fought as a Federation (the Australian colonies becoming united under a federal government).

The thing that struck me was how much the Boer War was the Vietnam of it's day. It was a war of unbridled imperialism, the reasons given for fighting the Boers were basically lies, plus it being a civil war at the same time. And in describing it as a civil war demonstrates that term is the worse description ever given for anything. It is the first time concentration camps were used with the Boer civilian population rounded up and placed in camps resulting in outbreaks of diseases that bebame epidemics killing thousands.

It is for this reasom many of the soldiers on returning to Australia (like their Vietnam descendants) found themselves pariahs as the Australian public became aware of tatics used in the war against the Boer civilian population.",history,0

"Well, I know a bit about the Hohenzollerns, so I can tell you, but you can also just google their name if you want to know more.

The original founders of the House of Hohenzollern pulled their name from Hohenzollern castle, which was inside the tiny little county of Zollern they ruled over in the Holy Roman Empire. Eventually, the House of Hohenzollern split into two branches, the main Franconian branch, who ruled over Prussia and Germany by the time of the abolition of the German monarchies, and the Swabian ""cadet"" branch, who kept ruling over their little principality in what is now Baden-Württemberg, separately from Prussia and the Franconian branch.

Eventually, the lands owned by the Swabian branch were incorporated directly into Prussia in 1850 as *Provinz Hohenzollern*. After the abolition of the monarchy, surprisingly, this little province remained as it's own land separate from Baden and Württemberg, which surrounded it. During the Nazi era, It was incorporated into one of the new administrative districts called *Gau*, known as *Gau Württemberg-Hohenzollern*. After the war it survived for a short time under French occupation before finally being incorporated into Baden-Württemberg following the creation of the BDR.

As far as I know, Hohenzollern castle is still owned by the family.",history,0

"This is not the case at all. To be brief, Jews were particularly disliked and considered 'other' throughout the medieval period, and in just about every society in which they lived. This was a result of their ability to loan money with interest, in their case at very high rates, known as usury. This gave them a particularly bad reputation. Further, they weren't able to swear oaths to feudal lords and as such tended to live exclusively in cities and thus work as artisans, jewellers, lawyers, advisors, bankers (when banks came about), whereas their gentile counterparts generally worked in agriculture. Again, this meant Jews were wealthier, better educated, and in turn more disliked. It was in fact not until 1964 that the Catholic Church ceased to be explicity anti-semitic.",history,0

Anyway, usually we use mostly geographic (by country or region) or ethnic names. And often we specify if they're ""Norwegian"" as well. Like ""Norsk-Pakistaner"" (Norwegian-Pakistani). But that is a fuzzy distinction, often the Norwegian part is implicit, from context.

"There are in fact rules for that thing. ""s"" was only used at the end of words, or in compound words at the end of the first part (I believe the word mis-state could be rendered misſtate, and of course such compound words are very common in German where ""ſ"" survived much longer), and ""ſ"" otherwise. A double s would generally be ſſ, but at the end of words would by these rules be rendered as ſs. This combination was turned into a ligature (a combination of letters represented by a single piece of movable type for convenience).

Other common ligatures were ſſ, ſi, ſſi, and, indeed, ſt.

"In a great inversion of what one might think for a nerd on the internet, my knowledge of the *landsknecht* is less than my practical knowledge of actually using a sword to fight - but, from what I know, I believe the greatsword/montantes shown in the OP were used partly to get the opposing force's pike-points off their line of attack, advance past the enemy point, and make the killing blow.  One of the big differences in the use of the montante vs. a spear or pike is that as a cutting weapon it's deadly along almost all of its length, vs. a pointed thrusting weapon that is only deadly at its point.  Once the spearpoint has been deflected off-line, the greatsword wielder can score a killing blow at relatively closer range or his pike-wielding backup can score a blow ""from the back row"" (pikes could be up to 20-25 feet).  

Part of the ability to deflect enemy points comes from the montante's huge grip - it results in having a huge mechanical advantage over the length of the weapon, and the point of the montante is very maneuverable.  Once a greatsword-wielding fighter got into range, they were (reportedly) able to do really bad damage to the first couple of lines of opponents and start the breakup their formations.  Once the formations have gaps, the *landsknecht* formations could find more ways to attack the individuals who get separated from their comrades, and then the whole enemy formation starts to break.  Once they realize they're *about* to start getting killed, the enemy formation unravels and suddenly things get really chaotic as the victims realize they're on their own against dozens of heavily armed opponents, and they run (for a while, until they get cut down).

Armed conflict with Nazi Germany was viewed as an opportunity to start a civil war against the communist government, alluding to Vladimir Lenin's strategy of using the First World War in order to create the October Revolution.

Skeptics of this approach argued that Adolf Hitler intended to destroy Russia as a nation, indicating his ideas of racial conquest and subjection or assimilation were made clear in Mein Kampf. They did not believe that Hitler distinguished Russians from Bolshevism, and that it would be better to either remain neutral or even support the Soviets during the war.


Adolf Hitler and some of his closest men were avid Slavophobes, as were many adherents of Nazi party ideology. Hitler was enraged when he learned of how many German generals and officers were supportive of forming a Russian-based army and forbade even the mention of the idea in his presence. Russian patriotism was suppressed, and Russian white emigres were kept as far from Nazi occupied Russia as possible in order to prevent the emergence of Russian nationalism. In contrast, many generals and officers of the Wehrmacht found themselves tempted by the idea of un-burdening the German army from the Eastern Front.


The conduct of the Nazis towards the Soviet population was so inhumane that it tremendously impeded the credibility of Russians who were working in alliance with the Wehrmacht.

"American troops didn't make terribly effective combat units.  They were inexperienced, as were their commanders, and repeated many of the mistakes made by other nations earlier in the war.  On the other hand, the impact on morale due to the Americans joining the war was what finally broke the Germans.  Germany had put everything it had left into the Ludendorff Offensive precisely because they were afraid of what the influx of American troops and supplies would mean to the war.  When that offensive stalled, the Germans had only the barest superiority in number and no reinforcements on the way.  The Allies, on the other hand, were receiving 10,000 fresh troops every day.  By the time of the Armistice, there were more Americans than British on the Western Front.  They hadn't been there for long, but the simple fact that they were there, with more on the way, was too much for an already war weary Germany.",history,0

"This was a presentation given at my local library this past week.

From the SoundCloud description: ""Kentucky Historian James Prichard discusses America's first serial killers, the Harpe Brothers.

In the aftermath of the Revolution and the long and bloody Indian wars, the Kentucky frontier remained a dangerous land. Throughout 1799 two brothers, Wiley and Micajah Harpe, terrorized the entire state from the Wilderness Trail to the far reaches of the Green River country. Posing as Methodist circuit riders or weary pilgrims bound for the West, these Tory outcasts left a trail of bodies and burned cabins in their wake. Their bloody deeds and violent end are as chilling today as the notorious crimes of modern day serial killers.""",history,0
"Most or all of the death camps were outside Germany in any case. Remember, this was wartime, and for Germans listening to foreign broadcasts or reading foreign publications was punishable by death. Even if you were a German who knew because a relative serving in a camp told you, what could you do with that information? If you told anyone you were placing you and your family's lives in danger because that kind of talk during wartime was punishable by death. And if you did manage to hear rumors your average German would probably have chalked it up to enemy propaganda designed to make Germans turn against their government or feel defeatist. Yes, some knew and many may have suspected, but the idea that ALL Germans knew that these were death camps is insupportable. 

I highly recommend reading 'I will bear witness' or 'To the bitter end' by Victor Klemperer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Klemperer). Fascinating diaries of someone who lived through that war. What I found remarkable is not his encounters with officious anti-semitic Germans, but that on almost every page he recounts how ordinary Germans and even officials went out of their way to assist him in small ways or commiserate with him as he was being persecuted for being Jewish. It just goes to show that not all Germans at that time were evil. You would think that would be obvious, but I am sure that I will get flak for this from those who belong to the 'All Germans Knew' school of thought.",history,0

"Nationalism is rising everywhere on the globe, especially in most european countries. In many countries it's as bad as it was pre-WW II.

The civil unrest is caused by this nationalism. Ot's easy to simply blame all problems on immigrants, since they are a “different group“ you can distance yourself from. They are not responsible for the real problems (social injustices like low chances to climb of you are born into a poor family, big gaps in income, the top 1% de-facto ruling the country etc.)

The world has become so unbelievable complicated to understand, so people crave for simple answers to complex problems. Nationalism provides these, what makes it incredible attractive for many people, even educated ones (either because they don't care or because they abuse it to get influence, money...).

Combine this with the unrepresentative news (which blow crime and violence out of proportion, we actually have decreasing crime in almost all developed countries) and how easy it is to create and spread your own propaganda and you basically get a real reason for civic unrest.

“we kept it because it was right“ is a huge generalization and simply false. You would not want to live in what basically was the middle ages. Nationalism breeds war and if you are born a woman the division between genders has many downsides. If you were part of 50% of a population you wouldn't want to be discriminated against. 
We kind of “evolved“ some of our modern values and living in a society that respects those values is arguably the best thing that can happen to you.

There are a lot more points I could discuss with you about. Sadly, english is not my best language and it is incredible annoying to type long texts, so I will stop here.

"Another tangentially related story (in that it is the story of an invaded nation being miraculously saved twice, which then became part of the national myth, which was then revived when that nation was in dire straits and facing invasion in WWII) is the [Miracle of the House of Brandenburg] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_House_of_Brandenburg). During the [Seven Years War] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War), Prussia suffered a terrible defeat at the [Battle of Kunersdorf] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kunersdorf). Frederick the Great wrote immediately after the battle:

&gt;This morning at 11 o'clock I have attacked the enemy. ... All my troops have worked wonders, but at a cost of innumerable losses. Our men got into confusion. I assembled them three times. In the end I was in danger of getting captured and had to retreat. My coat is perforated by bullets, two horses of mine have been shot dead. My misfortune is that I am still living ... Our defeat is very considerable: To me remains 3,000 men from an army of 48,000 men. At the moment in which I report all this, everyone is on the run; I am no more master of my troops. Thinking of the safety of anybody in Berlin is a good activity ... It is a cruel failure that I will not survive. The consequences of the battle will be worse than the battle itself. I do not have any more resources, and - frankly confessed - I believe that everything is lost. I will not survive the doom of my fatherland. Farewell forever!

Frederick was able to assemble 33,000 troops to defend Berlin from  the 90,000 allied Russo-Austrian soldiers. Though ""defend"" would not have been how Frederick would have put it:

&gt; [If they cross the Oder and march on Berlin] We'll fight them – more in order to die beneath the walls of our own city than through any hope of beating them.

The Russians crossed that very same day, the Austrians had the day before, and another Austrian army was quickly marching to join them. However for several reasons (logistics, strategic concerns, personal conflicts between the allies, etc.), the alliance felt it was unwise to march on Berlin, and so Frederick got his reprieve. It was he who gave it the name, the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg.

And so the war continued for 5 years, and though Prussia had its successes, they were once again on the brink of defeat. To quote my man Freddy again:

&gt;The Austrians are masters of Schweidnitz and the mountains, the Russians are behind the length of the Warthe from Kolberg to Posen...my every bale of hay, sack of money or batch of recruits only arriving by courtesy of the enemy or from his negligence. Austrians controlling the hills in Saxony, the Imperials the same in Thuringia, all our fortresses vulnerable in Silesia, in Pomerania, Stettin, Kustrin, even Berlin, at the mercy of the Russians.

Frederick the Great, ever the downer. He was trying to bring the Ottomans into the war with no success, and his main ally England was pushing for him to make a peace greatly weakening Prussia. Prussia had lost more than 100,000 men, more than a quarter of their officer corps, and 120 generals, so most of Prussia wanted peace at whatever cost. Even Frederick eventually accepted this reality and wrote:

&gt;We ought now to think of preserving for my nephew, by way of negotiation, whatever fragments of my territory we can save from the avidity of my enemies.

But all this was stopped by the second Miracle of the House of Brandenburg: Tsarina Elizabeth of Russia died, and her throne passed to her nephew, now Peter III. Peter was a German and a strong admirer of Frederick. He not only signed a peace taking not one inch of Prussian land, he also brokered a peace with Sweden, gave Frederick a corps of 18,000 men, and allied to march on Austria together. Quite a stroke of luck on Frederick's part.

The Nazis towards the end of WWII saw parallels with this as their situation became more and more dire. One of Hitler's ministers read to him from a biography of Frederick:

&gt;How the great king himself no longer saw any way out of his difficulties, no longer had any plan; how all his generals and ministers were convinced that his downfall was at hand; how the enemy was already counting Prussia as destroyed; how the future hung dark before him, and in his last letter to his minister, Count Finckenstein, he gave himself one last respite: if there was no change by 15 February, he would give it up and take poison. “Brave king!” says Carlyle, “wait ye a little while, and the days of your good fortune stands behind the clouds, and soon will rise upon you.” On 12 February the Czarina died; the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg had come to pass.

Hitler was moved to tears by this, and it was a thin shred of hope the German high command clung to in their desperation. That same minister, [Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutz_Graf_Schwerin_von_Krosigk) (who by the way is a really interesting dude, served as Finance Minister for 12 years under four Chancellors, two Presidents, and a Führer. EDIT: and was briefly Chancellor in all but name immediately before the German surrender.), describes how Goebbels was lecturing on how another Miracle was inevitable, and one staff officer interjected, ""What Czarina will die this time?"" Later that very same day, news reached Germany of FDR's death. The high command was ecstatic, the third Miracle had come, and rumor spread through the country that Truman was pro-German and soon the Western Allies would make peace with Germany, and they would all ally to defeat the real enemy: Bolshevism.
