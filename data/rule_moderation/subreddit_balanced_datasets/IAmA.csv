It is beyond clear to us that you people are twisted and want to endanger NC children. THE PEOPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA WILL NOT STAND FOR IT. I suggest that if you do want to push this issue publicly in North Carolina that you know the full consequences. You will be put on a list and monitored while you are in our lovely state.

"Ok, never mind Motherboard. Here's the Department of Homeland Security:

>For Immediate Release
DHS Press Office
Contact: 202-282-8010

>**The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process.** Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.

>Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company. However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government. The USIC and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assess that it would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion. This assessment is based on the decentralized nature of our election system in this country and the number of protections state and local election officials have in place. States ensure that voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and there are numerous checks and balances as well as extensive oversight at multiple levels built into our election process.

>Nevertheless, DHS continues to urge state and local election officials to be vigilant and seek cybersecurity assistance from DHS. A number of states have already done so. DHS is providing several services to state and local election officials to assist in their cybersecurity. These services include cyber “hygiene” scans of Internet-facing systems, risk and vulnerability assessments, information sharing about cyber incidents, and best practices for securing voter registration databases and addressing potential cyber threats. DHS has convened an Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group with experts across all levels of government to raise awareness of cybersecurity risks potentially affecting election infrastructure and the elections process. Secretary Johnson and DHS officials are working directly with the National Association of Secretaries of State to offer assistance, share information, and provide additional resources to state and local officials.

There's absolutely no concept of personal responsibility.

Another thing: when I was a PCP, I never prescribed opioids for chronic pain, and I would get a lot of heat from it from patients - people leaving my practice, stealing prescription pads, threatening my safety, etc. Go to /r/chronicpain and there are plenty of posters there boasting about how they went to ten different doctors until they found one who would give it to them, or how they would show up with family members at the doctor's office and threaten them for narcotics.

We lived in an apartment in Denver that we later realized had bedbugs, and we BEGGED our landlords to fix the problem (as they were contractually obligated) but they kept sending somebody who claimed that he couldn't find evidence. 

We called a lawyer who said that we couldn't claim unsuitable living conditions because bedbugs are  technically classified as ""pests"" and only ""vermin"" yield legal repercussions. It was so. Fucking. Frustrating. 

We eventually settled on calling Denver Public Health who were able to help us put pressure on our landlords to send somebody to clean up, but we had to stay in the apartment for the whole ordeal (broke college kids). We were being bitten all the time but we didn't have real legal recourse, and the apartment owners clearly didn't feel intimidated because there wasn't a whole lot we could do to them in retaliation. I think this should be addressed in legal terms so that landlords feel more pressure to deal with this issue.

"Hey James, I've been watching your channel ever since the first treehouse videos. That's somewhere in the ballpark of 5 years now. It only feels like last week you were doing Gay Tony's and playing challenge maps on Minecraft. I know you get an endless amount of these types of messages, to the point of where they've probably lost their charm, but I can't even begin to thank you enough for all that you've done for me since I began watching you. When I had no friends to hang out with after school, I always knew James would be there to make me not feel lonely. Thank you for being my friend when I had no one else around. Thank you for molding my teen years into what they were. And thank you so much for all of the laughs you've supplied to me during the darkest of hours. <3",IAmA,1

"Bivalve breeding is actually a surprisingly delicate and labour-intensive matter, or so I hear.  

Clams, mussels and so on have a complex (and relatively slow - in the case of mussels, it takes [*years* of growing](http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Mytilus_edulis/en) because they get to marketable sizes!) life cycle, which involves a free-swimming phase. They are also pretty sensitive to water conditions. 

Also, since you are talking about combining that with aquaponics: freshwater mussels *are* edible, but they are not often eaten - not sure why, perhaps they don't taste as good. Anyway, their life cycle presents an additional complication in that [their larval stage is a fish parasite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unionoida#Reproduction), so if you want them you need to keep fish around too. 

As for other molluscs... well, Cephalopods are definitely right out. Snails and so on might be feasible, not sure about that (land snails are pretty hardy, not sure about water ones), but they have a bit of ""ick"" factor for most Westerners (not me - I really like snails!). 

Personally, I'd keep things simple and just go with mealworms. Yes, they are kind of icky, but they are good protein that is easy as hell to raise and has no particular requirement. And really, once you ground them into a burger or whatever, why would you care what they look like? ",IAmA,0

First off, all of the answers I give about a new series are strictly HYPOTHETICAL. There is no new series, as sometimes gets reported...

The evolution in storytelling from Avatar to Korra was a result of me and Bryan maturing as storytellers as well as aging up the main character, so we went from what might be considered ""middle grade"" in Avatar to ""young adult"" in Korra. But I didn't feel limited by either series in what we could or couldn't explore. I find that a children's series can delve into some pretty deep social and personal issues. 

Rebel Genius (which is categorized as middle grade) definitely deals with some similar themes as far as personal traumas and societal struggles.

There's a huge gray area you fail to acknowledge between publicly documenting a trip to a developing country and being a tourist in a lush paradise full of tax sheltered elites.

I never suggested or implied it's our due diligence as tourists to expose the harsh realities of oppressive national regimes or depressed economies, I simply said that there is a movement of tourists who, like OP, want to do *just that*.

"I forget the exact figure, but they did a study last year and something like 60% of all jobs in Norway are never publicly listed, but are filled just through word-of-mouth and connections. Another study I saw said Norway was one of the top countries in the world for requiring networking to get a job. Point being, if you don't have connections here, it will be very difficult to find work, especially as a foreigner. The easiest way to get connections in your field is through studying with people. Many masters and doctorate programs are in English. I believe most doctorate programs pay you to study, like a normal job. You need to have a bunch of cash on hand to get the student visa initially for the masters programs (which you transfer to the Norwegian government to prove you can support yourself, and they transfer back to you when you arrive in Norway), but the education itself will be nearly free if you go to a public university. Check out the different universities (start with NMBU for biology, I would think), and see if there's a program that would fit you, even for an exchange program. Check Sweden and Denmark as well if you don't find anything in Norway - the political culture and social systems are fairly similar between the three countries.

Oh, and learn the language. They are rather militant about foreigners learning their language if they plan to ""live"" in Norway. Learning the language of the place you live/work is of course smart and polite, nothing wrong with that. It's just that in Norway, if you're living here, some people seem to expect that you can learn the language near perfect in six months, and are mad at you if you haven't. The more you know before you arrive, the better. Start reading articles in your field in Norwegian to learn the specialized vocab. Always emphasize your language skills in Norwegian, even if the job says it only requires English. Knowing basic workplace Norwegian, even for a supposedly ""English only"" job, will increase your chances of getting employment 10-fold.",IAmA,0

The same goes for anything hospitals clinics etc. People didnt even have electricity in those areas and our power stations were designed to serve only the white areas.

"Might want to request a Flavorist (aka Flavor Chemist). 

Source: I work at a flavor house, so basically companies come to us and say ""we want a strawberry flavor that tastes like candy."" And then the Flavorist will know exactly what chemicals to use to make that. I know a little about the process/what they do, and I am hoping to be a Flavorist one day. 

I can't speak specifically for McDonalds, but I know the answer to question 2 is a big no, flavors aren't bad for you. We are regulated by the FDA and we go through a lot of processes to make sure everything we produce is food grade and safe for the consumer.

Most big name brand companies (as well as many smaller companies) come to flavor houses and get us to design the flavors for them. We have all of the resources to research and develop new flavors, as well as match existing flavors, so it's easier for companies to just use us instead of doing it themselves. 
We also make masking flavors. Something too bitter/salty/etc. Yeah, we can hide that. It's pretty cool.
Something I didn't realize until I started working at a flavor house... We make flavors for EVERYTHING... Literally everything. Everything you consume that isn't a raw vegetable/fruit probably has a flavor in it. You want a breakfast sandwich from a fast food place? Yeah, there is a breakfast sandwich flavor in it to make sure it tastes good. I really didn't know just how many things contain flavors from flavor houses.

Flavorists know a lot about the different food grade chemicals and exactly how they smell/taste. A Flavorist is great because they can taste a blueberry flavor and say ""oh, it needs more of chemical x to be able to taste more natural."" I know people who can taste popcorn from a movie theater and say ""hey this is 30% acetoin"" just because they know the taste of the chemical. It's pretty crazy and really, really cool. ",IAmA,0

http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat
&gt; ""If all the grain currently fed to livestock in the United States were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million,"" David Pimentel, professor of ecology in Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, reported at the July 24-26 meeting of the Canadian Society of Animal Science in Montreal. Or, if those grains were exported, it would boost the U.S. trade balance by $80 billion a year, Pimentel estimated.
&gt; Animal protein production requires more than eight times as much fossil-fuel energy than production of plant protein while yielding animal protein that is only 1.4 times more nutritious for humans than the comparable amount of plant protein, according to the Cornell ecologist's analysis.

&gt;Animal agriculture is a leading consumer of water resources in the United States, Pimentel noted. Grain-fed beef production takes 100,000 liters of water for every kilogram of food. Raising broiler chickens takes 3,500 liters of water to make a kilogram of meat. In comparison, soybean production uses 2,000 liters for kilogram of food produced; rice, 1,912; wheat, 900; and potatoes, 500 liters. ""Water shortages already are severe in the Western and Southern United States and the situation is quickly becoming worse because of a rapidly growing U.S. population that requires more water for all of its needs, especially agriculture,"" Pimentel observed.

Livestock are directly or indirectly responsible for much of the soil erosion in the United States, the ecologist determined. On lands where feed grain is produced, soil loss averages 13 tons per hectare per year. Pasture lands are eroding at a slower pace, at an average of 6 tons per hectare per year. But erosion may exceed 100 tons on severely overgrazed pastures, and 54 percent of U.S. pasture land is being overgrazed.

""More than half the U.S. grain and nearly 40 percent of world grain is being fed to livestock rather than being consumed directly by humans,"" Pimentel said. ""Although grain production is increasing in total, the per capita supply has been decreasing for more than a decade. Clearly, there is reason for concern in the future.""

&gt;An additional 90 million metric tons of CO2 per year may be emitted by fossil fuels expended for intensive confinement operations (Steinfeld et al. 2006). Energy uses in these industrial facilities differ substantially from those in smaller-scale, extensive, or pasture-based farms. Although a large portion of the energy used for intensive confinement operations goes toward heating, cooling, and ventilation systems, more than half is expended by feed crop production, specifically to produce seed, herbicides, and pesticides, as well as the fossil fuels used to operate farm machinery in the production of feed crops (Steinfeld et al. 2006).
&gt;According to the FAO’s estimates, CO2 emissions from farm animal processing total several tens of millions of metric tons per year (Steinfeld et al. 2006). The amount of fossil fuels burned varies depending on the species and type of animal product. ",IAmA,0

"Depends how. If reducing waste costs more than producing the waste, then obviously it's not a cost saving, and that is what this is.

Hatching a chicken is ridiculously cheap, as is throwing it in the macerator; most of the cost of chicken farming is actually in the rearing of the chickens. 

This 'selective abortion', however, costs quite a bit of money; I haven't been able to find the actual cost, but in this case I have to agree with the free market capitalists; if it was cheaper, then the chicken hatcheries (or whatever they are called) would have implemented it as soon as they saw the capital investment as being viable; since they haven't, and most have no plans to do so besides the ones doing it for PR reasons, we must assume that at the very least it is somewhat more expensive, and given that there would be some value assigned to the PR benefits, it must be quite a bit more expensive.",IAmA,0

"Motivation in LD is a really difficult thing. As in my opinion its a phase people go in and out of. Similar to healthy eating or exercise. However a good way to stay motivated is to read up on Lucid Dreaming. Or watch Inception (my way of doing it) or the Matrix. 

If you need a pee then go to the bathroom, however it is best to stay in bed and do it straight away. One thing to note is that you can try FILD every night. So don't worry about failing it.

"Regarding Legend of Korra: how do you feel about the last season's mechs? Getting closer the end the season, I kind of felt like I'm watching technology fight technology, with Bolin in a mech, Kuvira in a giant mech, beaten by benders using flying mechs... I thought the message was about the old values, culture of all the benders to be shown as the inner values, standing proud in a new age of industrialism and not fading away, yet this is what I felt like happening.

Did I misunderstand the (background) message? Or what was the intention behind benders solving mech problems with their own mechs?",IAmA,0
"Hey! I'm pretty late to the AMA, so I don't expect my question to be answered, but I figured I'd try nonetheless! Here's a couple of questions for you.

* Korra and Asami's relationship was fairly groundbreaking, as I'm sure you and other people on the crew are aware. I'm wondering, did you have any ideas for LGBT characters in the original series? (I've known transgender smellerbee headcanons are fairly popular but I've seen headcanons for many other characters as well)

* Also, are there any recent kid's cartoons that you've personally enjoyed watching? I know one of my favorites is Steven Universe-- it reminds me a lot of what Avatar was to me growing up.

* Lastly, if there is one thing you could go back and change about either Avatar or Korra, what would it be and why?",IAmA,0

As you mentioned about making it a ""liveable"" for terrestrial life would take hundreds of years I would suppose. The sheer volumes of gasses we're talking about to make any atmosphere are hard to fathom.
