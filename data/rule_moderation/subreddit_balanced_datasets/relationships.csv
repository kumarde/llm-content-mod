"I'll second your analysis since reviews seem mixed. I think dating sucks. Being single is pretty sweet, but I've been doing that for about 4 years now and it, too, gets old. 

With this new gal, you're in the excitement phase that generally turns into the honemoon phase if you start actually dating. Don't confuse those butterflies for some kind of magic. Eventually, the new girl will be comfortable and less exciting, too (at best - bitch could be straight up crazy - you literally have no idea) and you'll be right  back here. This kind of dilemma is what drives the serial dating lifestyle - always seeking those butterflies.

""When a woman wants to go out [...] but can't afford to pay, or has a legitimate conflict, she will almost always make that clear.""

There are many aspects of this that are entirely contingent on your perception of OP's description of the conversation. What does that sound like? What does it sound like when spoken by this specific person? What did it sound like when she said it in this exact instance?

Not to mention the addition of the phrase ""almost always.""

Yes, it was that bad. He is the ""Missing Stair"" (google that; source NSFW) of your boyfriend's friend group. He is actually dangerous. He does not turn into a different person when he drinks: that's what he is.

In your place I would a) tell your boyfriend about the assault and b) tell him you will never again in your life be in Justin's presence no matter what.

Usually, when someone is yelling at you, the automatic response is to defend ourselves.  If you had approached her in a calmer manner, maybe she wouldn't have gotten so defensive.  No one likes to be yelled at, so of course she got defensive when you started.

>How can I fix this without being the bitch?

Well, first, by understanding that apologizing doesn't make you ""the bitch"".  Sometimes, you need to apologize simply for hurting the other person, even if you don't think you did anything wrong.  You should definitely (calmly) apologize for yelling at her.  How she responds will tell you everything.  If she apologizes back, great!

I felt bad for her because she blamed herself and she felt like less of a woman.  I tried to coax her into therapy and she would seem to agree but then never do it.

No, I don't agree that her husband is a pathological liar. I think he was young and told some lies in his youth that he kept up once in a relationship.

""She went pretty ballistic, direct messaging me on Instagram (no clue how she found my profile) calling me a dirty whore, his fill-in to get over her, that he doesn't care about me.""

I would argue that this seems to indicate that she was volatile even before the death of her daughter. Others have said that it is perfectly reasonable to act in the way she did as part of the grieving process. That would be true, if she had been previously a reasonable person, which your post indicates she was not.

Dan also lost a child here, and you clearly mean a lot to him. If he needs your support, and there's a difference between family support and support of a loved one, you should go, regardless of what Macy said. Talk to him, find out if that's what he needs, and if it is, back him up. He will defend you if need be at the funeral, as you are his guest.

He definitely had trouble sleeping that one night that he was really hyper for seemingly no reason.. and he wasn't trying to cheer me up either (the night that I was particularly sad). He even expressed how he couldn't sleep. He does stay up very late, but we all do, we're college students.

Other days he sleeps really late.

Something that has been strange to me recently is that he doesn't really finish full meals. This is odd because guys his age usually eat a lot, and he used to. However, at times, after a party especially, he can still finish half of a pizza by himself. 

I also noticed that he gets dry mouth pretty badly, which wasn't something that I noticed before. Though it could just be due to the weed.

In general, he does take care of himself. Showers everyday, brushes his teeth, etc. Honestly, I feel like if he was using something, he would be good about hiding it from me, and he would definitely be more like you, not really letting it stop him from functioning.. but I'm still not okay wit that.

And like you said, there is still no solid evidence of meth use. I don't want to jump to such a conclusion when it could be nothing.

I also really don't feel comfortable searching his phone. I have never been that type of person. I respect my S/O's privacy. At times he has been incredibly protective of his phone (though I don't suspect cheating), and sometimes of his laptop. He won't let me hold it or type things in, he has to. I can be the same way.. but only because I have photos of myself or strange googles/screenshots that are innocent, but would take way too long to explain. I also don't know his password, and even if I did I would feel terrible doing it. 

In a relationship I like to give the other person a lot of freedom and my trust. I feel like that is so honest that it would be *so* shitty of them to try to pull one over on me.. and if they did I would wind up finding out anyway. You know?

But frankly, these kids are only going to get worse as they get older, and the 13-year-old is already acting like he has a crush on you. The adults in your life aren't going to do a thing, because they think, deep down, that what these kids are doing to you is acceptable, normal, and funny.

Tell her what's been going on, and then tell her that, although you know she won't like it, if these kids push your boundaries again you're going to hit them.

I see a lot of bad behavior since I moved to China several years ago. And yes, all of this behavior comes from Chinese people. But, and that's the point, isn't that to be expected when 99% of the people in a place are Chinese? In a place with only white people, all bad things would come from white people as well. And more than that, there is always an explanation for it. Why are people selfish? Why are people mean to the poor? There are reasons for this that have everything to do with the stage of development, the history that led it there. And it has nothing to do with ethnicity. It just so happens that multiracial societies are brand new and even in multiracial societies you have multiple cultures that segregate themselves and keep bad facets of each culture alive. Cultures can be demonstrably backwards but the reason doesn't lie with ethnicity.

As to the schooling thing, tell her that if you intended to turn over sole control of any part of your parenting to any one person, you would only be doing so because you had turned over full legal custody.

Your wife is still your wife.  She's the still the person you fell in love with.  I think it would be helpful for you to try and separate out the different things you're upset about.  You're obviously upset that your wife kept something so huge about her past a secret from you...and that's totally fair I think.  

What about strippers?  Do you have a moral or ethical problem with what strippers do?  When I ask that...think about strippers in general...not your wife as a stripper.  Save that distinction for later.

I don't have a problem with people stripping and I'm really hoping you don't either.  If you don't, I think you should start off with by saying something like this:

>  Name, let me get this out here first because it's the most important - I don't judge you for what happened in your past.  I don't think you've done anything wrong by having been a stripper.  We didn't even know each other at that point in time.  I still love you.  That has not changed.

> That being said...I'm in complete shock.  I am upset and hurt too.  Not because of what happened i your past.  I'm upset and hurt because you never told me anything.  I mean...I do understand the logic of why you wouldn't want to tell people this information about you.  But we're husband and wife...we're supposed to know each other's secrets and I'm feeling a mixture of shock and hurt.  

>  Also, when you said that I could ask any questions right then but never again...I'm hoping that you only said that in the shock of the moment.  Obviously, I'm going to have questions and it's going to take me time to process all this.  So realistically, we're going to have to talk about this until the issue is resolved.  There just isn't any way around that and it would be unfair of you to deny me information for such a shocking reveal.

>  I love you.  I still want to be with you.  I'm not going anywhere.  But I think we need to get a marriage counselor to help us talk about this.  This is obviously difficult for you and it's also difficult for me.  I also think you should start seeing a regular counselor.  Your reaction over the last few days shows that you haven't really ever comes to terms with your past and I don't want to see you get hurt emotionally by all this.  I'm also going to hire an attorney and find out what our options are.  You deserve to have your past stay in the past.

The fact that you have kids and have been married for a decade, but still keep tabs on Lucy and attend conferences with the sole purpose of sering her makes you seem like an obsessed creep.

"The problem with his anger ""problem"" is, that to him it is *not* a problem. Anger management therapy is only useful when his anger causes actual problems like getting fired from jobs, getting into fights with strangers in bars, getting into trouble with the police.

But his anger towards you. The only ""problem"" it has caused is that you very occasionally, very gently with gloves on try to bring up the subject of therapy. Meanwhile you are *rewarding* him by severely underreacting to his behaviours, letting him get his way, not calling him out on his lies, not expecting him to fix the damage he did etc. His anger doesn't cause him trouble, it causes him priviledge and control. 

I'm not saying that you can fix him by reacting differently. You react the way you do to stay safe. I'm must saying that therapy is not going to fix his anger ""problem"". He is perfectly in control of his anger and no amount of therapy van ever outweigh the large rewards that his carefully controlled anget gets him. HE WILL NOT CHANGE.

There was no ""real"" medical reason to get it, but I was absolutely miserable with how I looked. I literally went months at a time without looking in a full length mirror if I could help it. Any time I caught a glimpse of my chest, I would feel so desperately miserable. My self-esteem was in the negative numbers. But I can't tell you how my life has changed after the surgery.

Basically, what I'm trying to tell you is to ignore people who are telling you that you'll ""grow out"" of wanting this surgery. Maybe you will, but you know yourself. I lived 6 years with my breasts the way that they were, and I *never* felt like I would one day ""accept"" the way that I was. 

Some things just need to be surgically fixed and that is okay. It's also okay to have cosmetic surgery to make you feel better about yourself. It doesn't make you any less of a person, and if it makes you happier, then I think it's the right thing to do. Good luck!",relationships,0

"Your dad was a crappy person in your childhood and treated you and your mother horribly. You bounced, he realized he was crappy, got therapy, changed, and has kept his word he will be better since.

It is up to you and solely you if that is enough to forgive him and carry on. Your boyfriend has no right to tell you how to feel about your father or his death. That is a deeply personal matter for you. It is sort of weird he is making this demand, like yes people generally don't like someone who has wronged someone they love but when they try and interfere with the person who was ACTUALLY wronged and their stage of forgiveness... that ain't right.

I think you have it right that getting engaged at the cost of your family is wrong. You are the one who lived that childhood and then adolescence as your dad changed his tune, nobody else.

"I spend most of my time on abuse subs, and I'm impressed with the foresight and self-awareness you're showing to be thinking about this.  Before I go on, would your mom be interested in leaving your dad if she had the ability?  Because there are resources available to her if she's willing.

Onto your issues: you're being prescient with this.  People who were abused as children are more likely to be abused as adults.  If you've never seen a healthy relationship, how would you know what one looks like?  To them, abuse seems normal, so they might gravitate towards abusive relationships just out of habit.  

The trick is to be able to identify what abusive relationships look like and realize that they are not healthy, and to change your personal habits that will attract abusers to you.  Abusers are skilled at spotting people who will be receptive to their abuse and choosing them as partners.  How?  People who were raised in abusive households often have trouble establishing normal boundaries.  This makes them good targets for abusers.  So learning how to do that would be a good start.  begin with internet articles and move up to either self-help books or communication books that offer to teach that.  The important thing isn't what method or technique they use, it's that you practice it all the time.  You're studying healthy relationships you want to emulate, not just unhealthy ones you'd like to avoid.  Trust your instincts.  I highly recommend *The Gift of Fear* by Gavin DeBecker as a good starting point that will help you keep yourself safe.  

Next, learn what abusers look like.  How do they go about drawing people in and abusing them?  For this, you'll need to read up on abusers and how they operate.  *Why Does he do That?* by Lundy Bancroft is a good starting point.  

You'll also want to recover from the emotional harm done by living with your father.  Your eating disorder and self-harm are good signs that you might benefit from therapy.  And recovery from abuse cannot take place while you are still being abused.  For your long-term recovery, you'll need to move away from your dad.  Many places have domestic violence laws that include things like yelling and throwing furniture, so if you want police help that is also an option.

Once you're safe, you can begin treating the aftereffects of abuse.  Anxiety, depression, low confidence and bad self-image are good examples.  This is also a good point if you feel ready to start dating (disclose your past abuse, good partners will stay with you and be understanding).  Physical exercise and social contact are essential to overcoming basically all of those.  A sport or hobby would be a good idea.  I especially recommend martial arts. 

Once you're actively working on that, you're basically doing better than a majority of people.  Everyone has issues.  Not everyone works to overcome them.

"Considering his household, he has a valid reason not to know. The important part about sex ed is you can link the biological information together with things that we always knew about, like getting pregnant. We all know it takes a sperm and an egg to get pregnant, but you need to be asking the right questions to know the right answer, like vaginal discharge or the function of the labia. It seems like he knew he has to use a condom, just never googled how to put it on.

You need therapy. You've been internalizing his treatment of you and it had gone on so long that it felt normal for you.

Nobody would stay if abusers were awful all the time from the start... they have to hook their victims in and then be charming enough to keep them there. It worked on you, and it's worked on many other victims.

"I'll try to help. My girls only recently stopped fighting, though they were rarely physical, and my youngest isn't much older than yours. 

First, the physical part has to stop. It's not okay to assault anyone, especially not a sister. You need to have a one on one talk with P. I don't know what to tell her, some I don't know her personally, but get her to understand how serious it is. 

PTell her it's illegal, or get her to put herself in her sister's shoes. Try to find out what is going on in her head.  Get her help to figure out what an appropriate punishment is. 

Do the same in reverse with G. Then get them together to discuss what you have decided. 

They are probably acting out because they are trying to find independence, discover who they are.

"Sometimes for people to lose weight, it helps for them to demonize the problem or think of sites like that as a negative consequence if they slack. Basically a ""Ugh I don't want to go to the gym/pass up dessert/etc. but I'm going to do it anyway because I don't want to become a story on /r/fatpeoplestories."" Using sites/Voat like Fat People Hate as a motivator is not an inherently bad thing. 

Our problem comes in where he wants to project his hatred of his own weight problems onto you and other people. The website did not create this hate, but it may have helped normalize it a bit for him where he feels more comfortable with expressing his distaste for overweight people than he would have before. Now, I've poked around on that site before when the sub got kicked off Reddit to see what all the fuss is about, and you are right that many of the people who post there are vile. But one thing they are not wrong about is that excuses for weight gain-- hypothyroidism, PCOS, etc.-- are a dime a dozen, can really only explainable an extra 10-15lbs, and are often thrown around as a distraction from the real issue-- a lack of disciple and failure to monitor diet. So while you probably think you are helping by pointing out potential medical issues, the issue for most people is really just eating too much and you making excuses is just confirming his belief that people would rather make excuses than accept responsibility for their choices. 

If he is using terms like ""pig fucker"" and ""butter chugger"" in a way that is demeaning to you, he is probably a Level 10 Shitlord by now and is too wrapped up in this hatred to get back. I'd leave. Like as soon as he said the pig fucker thing. No one deserves that kind of treatment from someone who allegedly loves them. It one thing to want to encourage someone to lose weight, but he is going about it the completely wrong way. However for you, if you actually want to lose weight (not sure from the OP, but it sounded like you did, and your BMI is 0.6 kg/m2 shy of obese), you need to talk to a doctor who can set you up with a diet plan.

Maybe B doesn't care about having a party for her baby, the baby sure won't care.  Maybe B wants to just spend the day with her child. 

I'd tell A to drop it.

"Nickelodeon UK made a study about maturity.  
Apparently women reach it around her 30s, and men around 40s. I think it was 32 and 42 exactly, but not sure.  

So as op is 22, in 10years she will be mature, and him at 30 in 12 years he will be mature.  

That's not logical, I know.

My son had a real confidence problem in general, and I enrolled him in a Hip Hop dance class. Now he loves dancing, has greatly improved self confidence, and he's a huge hit at parties. Most women find self-confidence to be extremely attractive.",relationships,0
"But it could explain part of OP's discomfort with the performance.  Like, a Jewish person dressing up as a stereotypical Jew (big nose, horns, whatevs) could be funny in the right  setting.  But a KKK member dressing up the same way, majorly offensive.

"Thank you, I really appreciate the time and effort you put into explaining things to me. I still have a little anxiety but overall I feel much more at ease. We still need to work on communicating about this though. Me doing the leg work to get educated isn't enough and hopefully he should work on being a bit gentler with me in the future.

"That must be incredibly awkward. 

I think the best thing you can do is really by there for Sarah. I'm not surprised that she doesn't hear the comments her Mum makes anymore. It's like that old myth about the frog in cold water not feeling it as the water heats up. People from abusive families can often become used to the abuse and even believe that they deserve it. Sarah probably feels she deserves the comments, it's sad. 

That being said it sounds like she is moving on in a positive direction in her life, so hopefully she'll be out of the house soon and making her own way in the world away from all that negativity. 

I'm torn on whether or not you should mention it too her again. Maybe she needs to hear from someone else just how ridiculous her mothers comments are?

In terms of dealing with her mother I'd practice deflection if I were you. Maybe everytime she says something negative you counteract it with something positive. So when she says something nasty about Sarah's eyebrows from example you could say 'I love how Sarah loves, I love her unique sense of style!'. Hopefully she'll eventually catch on that you aren't going to play her game. ",relationships,0

"Well, there you have it. He treats every ""serious"" conversation as a potential fight. You NEED to make counseling mandatory. Do not marry this person until he puts in the effort to learn how to talk about serious topics without putting up a wall. This is not normal, and it sure as shit isn't healthy.

Try this. ""SO, I love you. I am excited to share my life with you. But I feel like we can't have a serious conversation without you putting up a wall. As we grow together, life is going to throw serious things at us. As we are now, we can't handle them because we don't communicate. I need this from you in order to go forward...""",relationships,0

"You aren't obligated to hang out with anyone you don't want to hang out with, and I think the best thing you can do is be honest with your friend *if* she asks you what you're doing, and even if she asks why she wasn't invited, because maybe she knows people don't like her but don't know why.

I definitely have some friends who are awesome friends in doses, but who I can't hang out with 24/7 because it's exhausting.  I keep my boundaries with those friends.  However, some people in the past definitely have pulled back a lot and distanced themselves when they realized they wanted to be my bff and that I didn't really want to spend all day and night with them, so you should be ready for that.

I understand your struggle.  If you think A is valuable as a friend and you value her friendship, even if it's not a bff-type thing, you should make an effort every now and again to hang out with her and support her through her family drama.  Does she always have family drama, or is she going through something?  Because maybe all she needs is a friendly ear and support.  You can also encourage her to just be in a positive mood.

But you don't need to lie or hide what you're doing.  She can probably even sense that you're hiding it, which is even shadier than just being transparent.  Let her figure out that everyone is chilling without her, and maybe that will lead her to reflect on why people aren't inviting her out and perhaps she can make some improvements.",relationships,0
"Believe me, she 100% knows. And she is 100% embarrassed for other people to know, even best friends and possibly family. Unless you are rich/won the lottery and can save their home, absolutely under no circumstances mention that you know, unless she tells you. And until it is absolutely unavoidable, she won't. Just be supportive if she needs it. ",relationships,0
