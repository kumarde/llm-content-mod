"If the part closest to the dog is black, it's a tick.

Since you don't know what it is, I'm guessing you haven't removed a tick before either.

I'd recommend getting something like a ""Tick Lasso"" ( http://www.supercoolpets.com/pictures/trix1.jpg ) which makes the process super simple, and you'll learn how much to twist and how hard to pull.  You can get them at basically any pet-store, and in most pharmacies.

Once you've used one for a while, you can start removing them with just your fingers.

Please be careful though. If you do it wrong, and the head (the black part) stays in, it could be dangerous to its health. In humans, it's very dangerous for it to stay in (can cause Lyme disease, among other nasty ones).

But in the lab, on specimens that have been repeatedly tested with acid, the surface no longer reacts because the surface CaCO3 has already reacted. We have to rough up the surface to get fresh rock to test.

If that limestone with inscriptions has been sitting out in the rain for almost two hundred years, I would expect the limestone exposed in the grooves to have already reacted with the somewhat acidic rain, and thus to not react freely if exposed to acid now. So if you are willing to put vinegar or other acid (we use 1M HCl but vinegar also reacts, just not as vigorously) on one of the inscriptions, and it fizzes freely, that's a mark against it being a century old.",whatisthisthing,0

"With no other info, I would randomly guess that it might be part of a mill or an artillery emplacement (though not really with those wooden floors).  This carriage is clearly only meant to travel in a circle or an arc with forces pushing it to the outside edge.  Maybe an old time large telescope mount?  Something that needs to be continually rotated or otherwise moved in an arc.",whatisthisthing,0

It looks to me like it might be part of the high chair. The handle part of the hammer shape would go vertically between the child's legs to stop them sliding out. ,whatisthisthing,0
"How big are they and can you tell what they're made of? They look like brass but hard to tell.

Possibly primers out of a big gun?

I thought they were the brass from shotgun carts at first but I'd expect them to have a hole where the primer goes.",whatisthisthing,0
It would fit on top of a spear and stay in the gator after you poke it. Looks different than the ones I use so I don't know.,whatisthisthing,0

"The main purpose in these bulbs is likely heat retention rather than rate of exchange. 

They may not exchange heat as fast as direct ice, but they can be colder than ice, due to whatever is in the solution (glycol, etc).  The solution will also have a higher Cp than water, meaning more total heat must exchange before the bulbs come to room temp, so they'll stay cold longer. ",whatisthisthing,0
