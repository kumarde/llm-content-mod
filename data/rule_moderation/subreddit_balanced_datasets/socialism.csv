Centralized Government with massive power to the guy in charge? Check

Severe economic and social regimentation? Check

Forcible suppression of opposition? Milo was providing an opposing viewpoint, so they forcibly suppressed him and people interested in hearing him speak.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

To start - most of the ""homeless"" population aren't actually homeless - they're grifters, beggars, and panhandlers who probably do better than most of us. Around the corner from my last job sits a number of people who ask for money all day - one of them lives in a 3 bedroom town house nicer than where I live. They take the food, even though they are often on some form of welfare or takin in >$20k and still take food and resources for those who need it.

Then there's the trash - the massive and immense amount of trash. Everytime food is handed out, the individuals receiving the food just throw what they have in the street and on the ground, then we have to spend tax money to clean up this mess. 

Then there's the poo - due to most of these individuals being fed on the street there are not the appropriate facilities at hand to accomodate what often happens after we eat - we poo. So in the past there have been numerous individuals who choose to defecate out in public, that adds a whole other level of difficulty. 

We have places for the homeless to go, countless centers and facilities where there is help. The real homeless go there and get what they need - these aren't homeless, they're lazy bums who are just looking for a handout.",socialism,1

"The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation. The cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians’ intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate. It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its own image.

The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns. It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West.

The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population, of the means of production, and of property. It has agglomerated population, centralised the means of production, and has concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence of this was political centralisation. Independent, or but loosely connected provinces, with separate interests, laws, governments, and systems of taxation, became lumped together into one nation, with one government, one code of laws, one national class-interest, one frontier, and one customs-tariff.

The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground — what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour?

We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of agriculture and manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder.

Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it, and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class.

A similar movement is going on before our own eyes. Modern bourgeois society, with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. For many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production, against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeois and of its rule. It is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire bourgeois society on its trial, each time more threateningly. In these crises, a great part not only of the existing products, but also of the previously created productive forces, are periodically destroyed. In these crises, there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity — the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation, had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why? Because there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property. The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them. And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.

The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.

But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons — the modern working class — the proletarians.

In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, in the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working class, developed — a class of labourers, who live only so long as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital. These labourers, who must sell themselves piecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.

Owing to the extensive use of machinery, and to the division of labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and, consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is required of him. Hence, the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for maintenance, and for the propagation of his race. But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production. In proportion, therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working hours, by the increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of machinery, etc.

Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are organised like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the overlooker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it is.

The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour, in other words, the more modern industry becomes developed, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class. All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.

No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer, so far, at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.

The lower strata of the middle class — the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, and retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and peasants — all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their specialised skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production. Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population.

The proletariat goes through various stages of development. With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie. At first the contest is carried on by individual labourers, then by the workpeople of a factory, then by the operative of one trade, in one locality, against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them. They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments of production themselves; they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they set factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the Middle Ages.",socialism,1

"I have a story: 

I was once suffering from depression while my grandfather was starting to lose his memory and rapidly deteriorate. We were close. The only thing at that point in my life that helped me push through was the small business I own and run. I work at my job for over 60 hours a week and couldn't love it more. We give back to the community and hire vets and ex convicts who find difficulty in finding a steady job.

One day when I was feeling particularly down someone approached me with the ideas of socialism, and you know what? They made me feel even worse. My day went from bad to shit because this guy really believed I was a selfish pig, didn't work hard, didn't do enough for other people, and didn't deserve the ""massive profits"" my company is ""raking in"". (Hint, we aren't.... and I give myself a very modest salary - 50k). 

I guess what I'm getting at here, is that I worked my ass off, and helped a lot of people along the way through my own personal choice, and I guess I'm the bad guy. My business and hard work should be taken from me and given to people without the drive and passion i hold. No wonder this shit had never worked, never will, and is a utopian fantasy land.

> The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: 1. In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, **independently of all nationality**. 2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.

For a marxist, there are no blacks and whites, but there's working class and those who exploit it. Dividing working class to blacks and whites, to ""cishet"" and, uh, whatever is the antonym for that - instead of uniting them - helps no one but those who exploit said workers.

"Or or or...maybe it's that whites are killed more often by police than blacks. And while you're more likely to be shot by police if your black, it directly correlates with the amount of crime blacks commit. While they only make up for 13.2% of the general population, they commit more than 50% of violent crime. When a murder takes place between a black and a white, 84.9% of the time the black is the offender. When a murder takes place between a Hispanic and a black, 82.4% of the time the black is the offender. Blacks disproportionately commit the most murders. In the last 3 decades, blacks have murdered ~35,000 other black people (no outrage from BLM tho). They disproportionately commit violent crime. So when you have a small group of people committing so much of the violent crime, of course their chances of being shot by police will go up due to numerous reasons such as resisting or drawing on officers. It's been a while since I looked at the data, and it might have changed, but the number of unarmed blacks that are killed by police each year is below 50. So maybe, just maybe, people are tired of people throwing up the BLM sign because, based on the data, blacks aren't targeted by police in order to kill them. Yeah they're over-represented in crime statistics but that's easily explained based on the fact that blacks commit so much crime compared to every other race. So these BLM signs and protestors only serve to divide us. Maybe if they took the stance of ""police/justice reform"" rather than ""blacks are being hunted down,"" they would find greater support. Also, when they make people like Mike Brown their martyr, they lose support. Or when members riot and burn buildings down and verbally assault anyone who doesn't expressly support them. But hey, say that I'm racist because I don't support BLM, that seems to be the narrative lately anyway.

Because then the market will find the most efficient way to produce energy at the lowest cost to society.

"When it's about organizing street protests against legitimately reactionary forces, it's good.

When it's about inundating the left with an ideology that the right to free speech shouldn't be defended, or that when it comes to speech and association, might makes right, then it's bad.

If it involves people coming together to express outrage against reactionaries and capitalists, it's good.

If it involves people being manipulated to disrupt the speech and association of other anti-capitalists or radical ecologists, it's bad.

There's no simple good/bad answer as it depends on the particular anti-fa protest and the reason for it.  There have been productive anti-fa demonstrations and there have been counter-productive ones.

I'd honestly rank the recent events in Sacremento as counter-productive because however well-intentioned the protest, the main result of that incident was that fascist groups were able to get their name and message out into the press for a brief moment.  Not to diss the well-meaning people who participated in that protest.

Similarly, anti-Trump protests where protestors yell ""fuck free speech"" only confuses people about the meaning of socialism and makes the American left appear like a bunch of bloodthirsty Stalinists

Indeed the main reason anti-fa is problematic is the attitude we see in many of the posts in this thread that respect for ""freezepeach"" is some kind of liberal idealism rather than the bedrock of any future socialist society.  

In fact, advances in free speech rights are one of the few progressive gains of the 20th century, but they are under concerted attack by governments today

Without the free flow of information and freedom of speech and association, 'socialism' will not be possible, period.  

A productive attitude towards justifying anti-fa would frame anti-fa actions as a counter-protest or another form of free speech and association, rather than framing anti-fa as a kind of proletarian state apparatus that has the right to shut down any speech it deems inappropriate.",socialism,1

"> > In my city, not a single school had any method of standardizing high school performance that was conveyed to colleges.
> 
> Except the SAT, which you said is standardised.

1. High school performance refers to your performance in high school classes. In our high schools, your teachers give you a grade based on test they administer, the grades you receive are averaged and weighted by the school to generate your overall grade (GPA) (not all courses are equally weighted because some are less work), which is used by colleges to understand how well an applicant did during high school.
2. The SAT does not impact your high school GPA
3. The SAT reflects intelligence, not high school performance or learning. It does not test anything that was taught in high school unless you have special needs (a disability) and were advanced to high school prior to learning geometry.

In conclusion, there is no standardization of high school performance. The only standardization for students is their SAT scores, which are submitted in conjunction with but have no relation to your high school transcript.

> So, somewhere, I can find 2 schools taking the same tests. Presumably I can find several, in fact. Even if I can also find 2 schools that aren't taking the same tests.

You might find some schools taking the same test in one or more subjects, but the colleges to which they are applying have no insight into that. The US is a large country with many different local laws and regulations. I don't know them all. There are 37,000 high schools in the US. The fact that maybe a few of them share tests is meaningless, especially considering that (a) colleges have no insight into what tests are shared and (b) the maximum theoretical percentage of schools administering the same test is 4% (in practice, it is likely < 0.5%). The similarities that may or may not exist are insignificant.

> So, unless my reading comprehension is indeed as bad as you seem to think it is, this looks like a state-wide standardised test for public education regarding science. With the exception being for students with disabilities, who can take other standardised tests.

That test doesn't impact your GPA and is not revealed to colleges when you apply. It has no bearing on your college application or high school evaluation. This test can be used to allow you to take college courses in high school, but it is not used in the college admissions process.",socialism,1

"To be honest, I'm not trying to ""box you into"" any school of moral thought, it's just that your comments here display a lack of familiarity with the meta-ethics of abortion, which is the relevant knowledge-set when making any assertion about it.  For instance, ""the scientific conception on the beginning of life"" is not and never has been a point of contention in the moral discourse over this topic.  That matter is trivial: fertilization.  The interesting question is when *personhood* is achieved, or when, if ever, a developing fetus could gain a right to life that overrides a woman's right to bodily autonomy.  You're correct in that these are philosophical questions, but nothing about that fact implies they are subjective.  On the contrary, the overwhelming majority of moral philosophers would strongly affirm the objectivity of the truth-value of moral claims.  *Which* moral claims are true is far more contentious.  

There are strong moral arguments for abortion - the violinist argument if you're concerned about natural rights, and most variants of consequentialism if not (everyone should read *Practical Ethics* at least once).  Adopting naive positions about the subjectivity of all morality will do little but put you in a position where you can't say anything with conviction.

"Increase world GDP per capita by 25%, as an approximation of current inefficiency compared to future socialist relations of production: `10,136 × 1.25 = 12,670`. I would welcome a more accurate estimation of this, but i seriously doubt it's more than 25%.

Adjust for climate change (see previous comment): `12,670 × 0.625 = 7,918`

Assume a flat distribution internationally, favoring your thesis by not adjusting for historical infrastructural disparities requiring increased allocation to the Third World until equality is reached. I would also welcome an estimate of this. There are probably statistics on the sunk costs of buildings, water systems, electricity grids, roads, and so on, that we could use.

Percentage decrease from median UK income to climate-change and socialist adjusted GDP per capita: `(7,918 - 24,269) ÷ 24,269 = 67.37% decrease`

My original statement stands, with a significant margin for error in these estimations.

These percentages are only rough, but the huge difference between median incomes in the First World and global GDP per capita, mean that we can adjust global GDP per capita by any foreseeably reasonable percentages without the disparity between median incomes in the First World and global GDP per capita disappearing.

---

So what would it take for my thesis to be incorrect?

I'll make things as favourable to you as possible and suppose that climate change is a non-factor (as well as continuing to ignore adjustments for sunk international inequalities).

Assuming current living standards are measured by current income, and future living standards are measured by one persyn's share of current world GDP per capita adjusted for capitalist inefficiency to give a socialist version. How much does capitalist inefficiency need to be for the median UK persyn's living standards to not change?

Percentage increase in future socialist productive efficiency for world GDP per capita to equal median UK income: `(24,269 - 10,136) ÷ 10,136 = 139.4% increase`. A utopian fantasy.

---

**Edit:** I've been banned. Apparently Third Worldism is the only Marxist tendency banned from this subreddit. Dangerous to the social-imperialist ambitions of the First World ""left"", and so on.

To reply to the comment below this; it is true that there will not be a perfect correlation between capitalist accounting methods and a socialist economy. This is not the same as these statistics being utterly worthless. I must also repeat the fact that the margin for error is vast, given the favourably estimated **67.37%** decrease in income. Nevertheless:

A certain amount of money is able to realize a certain amount of value by purchasing commodities on the market. A First Worlder on wages of $10 per hour is thus, naturally, able to command a certain amount of value accordant with $10 per hour. Things get interesting when we take into account international wage inequalities and the globalisation of commodity production. Low-wage workers from the global south who produce commodities for export to the imperialist metropoles allow higher-wage workers to exchange one unit of high-wage labour time for multiple units of low-wage labour time. A labour aristocrat on $10 per hour can, for example, purchase commodities embodying four hours of labour, assuming wages of $2.50 per hour in the Third World export sector. If we reduce First World income, the ability of labour aristocrats to benefit from this process, called unequal exchange, decreases. What the GDP figures and income distribution statistics show is that First Worlders are currently on the exploiter side of the international equation. To talk about income distribution is to ultimately talk about value distribution, because money is exchanged for goods under the capitalist mode of production and functions as a store of value. This has obvious relevance to socialism, and although there is not a perfect correspondence, it is the best indication we have. And it indicates very strongly -- far outside the margin of error we might expect from a slightly imperfect indicator -- that First Worlders' share of global value must decrease in socialism.

I recommend that anyone reading this, and interested in learning more about what a *truly* equal international society looks like, to check out the [reading list on Third Worldism](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/54rwy3/readings_on_third_worldism/d84mr87).",socialism,0

"Nobody is ""watering down the definition of socialism,"" we're expanding it by incorporating critiques of capitalism from outside traditionally ""socialist"" circles. For me, and I expect many others, Einsteins 'Why Socialism?' was an important step in becoming a socialist, not just in breaking the stigma around the word, but also informing us with basic yet profound critiques of a system that commodifies everything from water and food to blood and bone. I can trace a direct line from Bernie Sanders to Einstein to Eugene V. Debs in my journey out of capitalist indoctrination and into a better understanding of how the world works and the ways and means by which to fix it. By your suggestion I should have completely disregarded Sanders and Einstein because they're not ""pure"" socialists, and yet had I done that I don't think I would have become a socialist, and the movement would be down yet another person.

"&gt; I was more thinking that leftist thought tends to discourage elevating one person above the masses, and stories with heroes, especially superheroes, tend to implicitly hold up that person as special.

Well I think superhero stories do a great job of simultaneously doing and not doing this. Very often the stories will show how people look up to these heroes only for the reader to see that these people are just as deeply flawed as those they protect. So in that sense, the idea is always present that they aren't better because of their powers, but at the end of the day they are just people trying to do the right thing, which I believe is a leftist theme. 

Then of course there are characters like Superman where the whole point is that he is better than the rest, but he has the moral fortitude to not abuse his power and exists as a symbol of the bright future and idealism humanity tries to achieve. But that's a different topic.

Regarding Batman, he has had more of a varying political alignment compared to the others mentioned, but I still believe he is most often left-wing in his portrayal. We often see him make large contributions of money in police and prison reform efforts, as well as construction projects to rebuild homes for the poorest of Gotham's citizens. It is also firmly established that early in his career he helped to clean up the city by taking down corrupt politicians and crooked cops. Hell, one of his most famous villains, the Penguin, is the representation of a greedy, manipulative capitalist pig. I have also heard people criticize him for ""beating up the mentally ill,"" but to that I say he's only beating them up because they are murdering people in mass and he's the only guy who can stop them. Even after the fact, Batman refuses to kill these people and puts them in a system that, while broken in many aspects, tries to rehabilitate them and is trying to be improved by his alter ego.

Thus, when Donald Trump comes along galvanizing the far right with his fiery rhetoric against minorities and women, blaming all of our problems on ""political correctness"", they (as in the ""nerdy new atheist turned alt-right young white men"") see that he's attacking those who criticize them (for being insensitive, etc.) and feel like someone is *finally* standing up to the ""SJWs"" who they feel hate them for being white.

Also keep in mind that there are some significant arguments over what is and isn't communalization/commonization, some people don't believe Tiqqun are part of it, some people don't believe that Tiqqun's ideas offer a real break from Capitalism.  The ""American Style"" of communization that occurred in the late 2000s was inspired by Tiqqun but was similar to Occupy more than it was Revolutionary Politics, specifically in that it wanted to set apart alternate spaces absent of monopoly and enterprise but not absent of Capital.

http://libcom.org/library/what-are-we-do-endnotes


I think the above link offers a good critique and explanation of some of it's failings.

Specifically:

&gt; For us, communization does not signify some general positive process of ‘sharing’ or ‘making common’. It signifies the specific revolutionary undoing of the relations of property constitutive of the capitalist class relation. Sharing as such – if this has any meaning at all – can hardly be understood as involving this undoing of capitalist relations, for various kinds of ‘sharing’ or ‘making common’ can easily be shown to play important roles within capitalist society without in any way impeding capitalist accumulation. Indeed, they are often essential to – or even constitutive in – that accumulation: consumption goods shared within families, risk shared via insurance, resources shared within firms, scientific knowledge shared through academic publications, standards and protocols shared between rival capitals because they are recognized as being in their common interest. In such cases, without contradiction, what is held in common is the counterpart to an appropriation. As such, a dynamic of communization would involve the undoing of such forms of ‘sharing’, just as it would involve the undoing of private appropriation. And while some might valorize a sharing that facilitates a certain level of subsistence beyond what the wage enables, in a world dominated by the reproduction of the capitalist class relation such practices can occur only at the margins of this reproduction, as alternative or supplementary means of survival, and as such, they are not revolutionary in themselves.


&gt; communization is the product of a qualitative shift within the dynamic of class struggle itself. Communization occurs only at the limit of a struggle, in the rift that opens as this struggle meets its limit and is pushed beyond it. Communization thus has little positive advice to give us about particular, immediate practice in the here and now, and it certainly cannot prescribe particular skills, such as lock-picking or bone-setting, as so many roads, by which insurrectionary subjects to heaven go.5 What advice it can give is primarily negative: the social forms implicated in the reproduction of the capitalist class relation will not be instruments of the revolution, since they are part of that which is to be abolished.


&gt; Texts such as Call or The Coming Insurrection however, do not even properly ask the question of what the revolution is, for in these texts the problem has already been evaporated into a conceptual miasma. In these texts, the revolution will be made not by any existing class, or on the basis of any real material, historical situation; it will be made by ‘friendships’, by ‘the formation of sensibility as a force’, ‘the deployment of an archipelago of worlds’, ‘an other side of reality’, ‘the party of insurgents’ – but most of all by that ever-present and always amorphous positivity: we. The reader is beseeched to take sides with this ‘we’ – the ‘we of a position’ – to join it in the imminent demise of ‘capitalism, civilization, empire, call it what you wish’.


&gt; Taking the immanence of the self-reproduction of the class relation for a closed system without any conceivable terminus, Marcel posits the necessity of a purely external, transcendent moment – the ‘withdrawal’ on the basis of which communists can launch an ‘attack’. But, within this world, what can such ‘withdrawal’ ever mean other than the voluntaristic forming of a kind of ‘radical’ milieu which the state is quite happy to tolerate as long as it refrains from expressing, in an attempt to rationalise its continued reproduction within capitalist society, the kind of combativity which we find in The Coming Insurrection?

What would ""revolutionizing the actual social relations of a workplace"" look like, if not to a large part a logistical concern? I'm not trying to be pedantic here, but just genuinely interested in this criticism. What would ""social change driving technology"" look like? 

This seems prima facie strange to a Marxist perspective, which holds that social relations largely stem from material productive modes. 

I also don't really understand what the blog post is recommending. Development of technical systems requires the skills and knowledge of programmers, engineers, etc. I would actually be tempted to argue the opposite: if you leave the infrastructure largely intact as it is (the state, the factories, etc.), you merely reproduce the power relations that those infrastructures were designed to facilitate and enforce. There would need to be a radical transformation in *how* things are facilitated logistically (how things are produced, where they're produced, how goods/services are distributed and how 'demand' is registered), and there would need to be a dismantling of apparatuses of coercive violence (the state, intelligence networks, military, etc.) and a building of completely different institutions.

"No. I have a damn hard time listening to right wingers. All they care about is immigration. 

It is literally the only thing they give a shit about, it's fucking insane, the logic works backward from blaming immigrants and poor people. Since every discussion with them centers around this, I have nothing to say. I disagree with the anti-immigration attitudes that form the bedrock of modern conservative thought. 

Also, I honestly don't think you ""convince"" them of anarchism, socialism, or communism. They would arrive at these conclusions through their own choosing, no conversion necessary. 

If anything, I've noticed conservatives (not all, but some) have the potential to be very calm and respectable of differing views, more so than liberals. 


However, if you push them on views they disagree with, they'll make sure you understand their position--whether through violence or peace. 


I've been around plenty of right wingers in public, and noticed that their calm respect for differing views is a thin veil of bullshit once they start talking behind closed doors.

I work for two small companies owned by the same couple. The wife has zero concept of the work required for development and she's too narcissistic to give a damn. The husband tries to keep the wife in check, but only so much can be done since she pays the bills.
  
Sometimes you get totally fucked, myself and my counterpart at the other company are the usuals since we do the widest range of jobs (anywhere between 45-82 hours per week), whereas the two guys sitting next to me right now usually get done with 40-43 hours.
  
We all get paid well, over $60k, but the point made by u/Dreadniah about converting to hourly pay is very accurate. If there's any conferences or demos going on, this job is miserable and I hate it. Not to mention those events are around 40% of the year. We get less than 10 holidays (often asked, indirectly, to come in during), and no vacation for the first year, 5 days after that.
  
On the bright side, the husband is fun as can be and, medically, you get to do whatever you need to do without *too much* complaining. I can't count the days/hours I've missed between psychiatrists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, endocrinologists, and the regular getting sick (got an rather aggressive and inoperable brain tumor).

In a similar/related field.  I tolerate working because I don't have much other choice.

"&gt;What would ""social change driving technology"" look like? 

In the context of Chile, it would have been more focus given on actually restructuring the relations within the workplace; as it stood, Project Cybersyn had such a goal, but ended up being much more driven by deploying the network in a way that was still controlled by plant managers; ordinary workers didn't do much either in design, or in the use of the system.  In order for the project to have achieved its goals of enabling decentralized socialist planning (assuming the coup never happened, of course), it would have required much more effort put into transforming the division of labor in the factory--something that technology can't do on its own.  

&gt;if you leave the infrastructure largely intact as it is (the state, the factories, etc.), you merely reproduce the power relations that those infrastructures were designed to facilitate and enforce

Yes, I agree; the argument isn't that infrastructure has to be left alone, but that creating substantive changes in the way the economy is planned and coordinated via technological development has to be done in parallel with transforming social relations.  Again, in the case of Project Cybersyn, the mere existence of the network didn't accomplish all that much in terms of empowering workers or decentralizing planning, and technically, it could have easily been appropriated by an authoritarian capitalist government to *increase* the exploitation and repression of workers (which was a major critique from other cyberneticians at the time).

"Sure, I'll mention how the written ""about us"" section is deliberately silent in ways that is intended to appeal to the petty bourgeoisie. It's pretty obvious, actually, in a number of ways. First, there is no mention, whatsoever, of actual **revolution** (you are a **revolutionary** socialist, right? and SocAlt is trying to build a **revolutionary** party, right?).  The platform makes reference to inroads on ""big business"" (""small business"" isn't a problem at all in their organization?). Only ""major"" banks are to be brought under democratic control (but not ""small"" banks?). ""Anti-corporate candidates"" are to be supported in elections. It goes on and on in its mealy-mouthed silence about what the party's aims actual are. As Trotsky said in his critique of the program advanced by the editors of the *Action Socialiste Revolutionnaire*: ""'Down with big business!' [their demand] -- But we aren't for perpetuating
small business."" (Writings of Leon Trotsky, 1935-1936, p. 96). Socialists should be open that, whatever benefits that small business owners can get under a workers' state, the ultimate goal is a society in which they are expropriated of their means of production. This isn't mentioned at all in the document, which instead only references a ""socialist plan for the economy"" (does this socialist plan just regulate small proprietors? It's unclear from the text).

Yeah, I know, I know. This isn't the full program, right? It's the ""transitional method"" that Trotsky wrote so much about, right? Wrong. For Trotsky, the transitional method was to deploy transitional measures while simultaneously mentioning that the only way they could be accomplished (and inroads made on ""big banks"" and ""big business"") was through workers seizing state power -- WORKERS and those who support them, not this ambiguous ""public"" invoked on the SocAlt page as people who will be 'democratically' controlling the largest corporations. This is how revolutionary socialists make a revolutionary party -- by being clear about their aims (not disdaining to be open about them, as Marx said). Trotskyists recruit on the party's full program and use transitional demands in order to do that. For Soc Alt, it's about putting forth measures which might be transitional in some objective sense, but never being clear about what would be required to actually accomplish them. It's centrism through and through, all directed toward culling large portions of other classes for a program that would be acceptable to them and their existing political assumptions. This is not Bolshevism.

The rest of your post is equally bad. You accuse me of making up a concept -- ""lumpenbourgeoisie"" -- that you claim was nowhere to be found in Marx's writings. When I show where it is, you don't actually concede your accusation was baseless and that - *gasp* - somebody you're arguing might actually know more about Marxism then you. Why would you do that? Instead, you pretend that Marx's concept of the lumpenbourgeoisie refers to ""the 1%"" (!). Then you accuse me of saying that he was referring to the middle layers. Where on Earth do you come up with this stuff?

I said that the 1% excludes only the farthest heights of the bourgeois class (which is different than the heights of ""bourgeois society"" -- once more, check your reading comprehension). In fact, this supposed ""99%"" you are so infatuated with would include not just members of the ""middle layers"" as you call them, but also sections of the bourgeoisie proper -- and their hangers-on in the lumpenbourgeoisie I am pleased to see you now acknowledge Marx wrote about (while trying to appropriate it ever so opportunistically to your left-reformist vision, as is de rigueur with you) in contrast to your earlier claim that my invocation of such a group was unMarxist.

Stein's program does appeal to a layer of the capitalist class -- the lowest layers who exploit wage labor while also occasionally engaging in working-class functions themselves. You may not know this, but this is the definition of petty bourgeois. And that's what her program is.

Enough of this nonsense about how some meaningless addendum to their written platform means that the party is ""anti-capitalist."" The party is the same as it ever was in terms of program: it appeals to the middle class's sense of being crushed by larger forces (the ""corporations"") in order to break them up into ""democratic"" firms that are ""locally controlled"" on principle. There is no reference to the special role of the working class, no understanding of capitalism as a system being the problem -- none of that. If this is ""anti-capitalist,"" then it is ""anti-capitalist"" (e.g., monarchist feudalism) in a way that has nothing whatsoever to do with trying to organize or support a proletarian revolution. For Marxists, this isn't just hot air or rhetoric -- the party question is the question of whether an organization is capable of becoming or aims to become the political instrument of an independent working-class movement against capitalism. The Green Party's propaganda, practice, platform -- none of it -- seeks to do this. It is a petty bourgeois party, not a workers' party, through and through. Supporting its candidates or running on its platform is a betrayal of the basic principles of Marxism, of working-class independence.",socialism,0

"&gt;I’m pretty dumb and I know barely anything but in my head this seems like a good idea.

Don't say that! 

What you're describing sounds a bit like [Syndicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicalism) which is definitely a form of socialism. In my opinion (and this is a topic that I'm not incredibly familiar with so someone may correct me) there is nothing wrong with Syndicalism per se, but it lacks a sort of overarching, unifying force to hold it all together - for example, Leninism has the vanguard party and its associated characteristics. 

That being said, the basic components of Syndicalism - the democratic management of the means of production, be that location by location, in communes, by industries, or some combination thereof, is present in virtually every kind of socialism and is central to the system. So, I think that Syndicalism is best understood not as a be all end all theory that stands on its own, but rather as an integral component of a larger socialist model. ",socialism,0

"&gt;The media describes people “climbing” out of poverty, as if they have at last crested Everest and can finally breathe that crisp, middle-class air. But all they’ve really done is crossed an arbitrary threshold used to determine social-program eligibility.

&gt;Still, Republicans and Democrats alike frame their social programs, no matter how different, in terms of fighting poverty. And the metric of their success is often based on the poverty rate.

&gt;Yet for all its mystique, the poverty rate is nothing more than an outdated administrative marker, set far below any remotely sensible definition of a decent life. The consequences for poor people in need of the social services that are distributed based on that marker are often devastating.


&gt;The New York Times story demonstrates unwittingly the poverty of the poverty line:

&gt;Christine Magee, a mother of four, joined an intensive self-sufficiency program administered by the Chicago Housing Authority and the Heartland Alliance after she fell into bankruptcy from racking up $22,000 in debt on a credit card. As a recipient of a federal housing voucher, Ms. Magee was eligible to enroll . . .

&gt;Ms. Magee’s husband has found only sporadic work. But she has moved from a health-technician job that paid $23,000 a year and left her family on Medicaid to one at a veterans hospital that pays more than $35,000 and provides health and educational benefits. The extra earnings automatically went into an escrow account.

**And for any Canadian comrades**:In March 2015, 852,137 people received food from
a food bank in Canada. More than one-third of those
helped were children.

https://www.foodbankscanada.ca/getmedia/01e662ba-f1d7-419d-b40c-bcc71a9f943c/HungerCount2015_singles.pdf.aspx?ext=.pdf

Canadians waste $31 billion of food every year, 47% wasted in the home*.
The primary contributor to consumer food waste is high expectations—demand for high-quality, aesthetically-pleasing food is a key factor behind the volume of food waste occurring among consumers.*
In North America, over 30 percent of fruits and vegetables are rejected by supermarkets because they aren't attractive enough for consumers.

http://vcm-international.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Food-Waste-in-Canada-27-Billion-Revisited-Dec-10-2014.pdf

Food insecurity rates have remained relatively stable over time. Every year from 2007 to 2012, approximately 5% of Canadian children and 8% of Canadian adults lived in food insecure households. This means that they did not have access to a sufficient variety or quantity of food due to lack of money.
The most recent statistics indicate that in 2011–2012, 8.3% of Canadian households experienced food insecurity.
Nunavut had the highest rate of food insecurity (36.7%), over four times the Canadian average (8.3%) in 2011–2012.
In 2011–2012, the rate of food insecurity was more than three times higher in households where government benefits were the main source of income (21.4%) compared with households with an alternate main source of income (6.1%).
Among various household types, lone-parent families with children under 18 reported the highest rate of household food insecurity, at 22.6% in 2011–2012.

Food insecurity exists within a household when one or more members do not have access to the variety or quantity of food that they need due to lack of money.Note 1,Note 2 In 2012, Canadian food bank usage continued to increase across the country, indicating that some households still experienced difficulties putting food on the table.Note 3

Researchers have found that people who experience food insecurity also tend to report:

poor or fair health


poor functional health, or an inability to perform key activities due to health problems


long-term physical and/or mental disabilities that limit activity at home, work or school


multiple chronic conditions


major depression


a perceived lack of social support, such as someone to confide in, count on, or go to for advice.

I am lambasting them for not sticking to their guns, yes. I'm not lambasting them for practicing a form of entryism or infiltration into bourgeois elections. Not at all. 


I am lambasting those that have said all along that they didn't care about such things, but inevitably greet a large org. like the EZLN's approach to bourgeois participation as a ""positive change"" to what is a ""dwindling left"" and other nonsense that goes against their ideology that rigorously opposes such changes.


This is what I'm opposing. The ideological line-towing that says ""ooh, big scary bourgeois state, better not try and challenge it in any formal way!"" that is so engrained in libertarian and anarchist mind sets, as if the only way to challenge a bourgeois state is through dogmatic non-compliance.



If the EZLN could seize the Mexican government through popular support, I am saying all the more power to them, against those who dogmatically oppose such endeavors. 


What I'm saying is, this won't happen as long as you have thousands of people on the sidelines playing the role of armchair revolutionary saying ""this isn't anarchist!"" or ""we can't engage with the bourgeois state!"" as some kind of limit as to what is acceptable and what isn't for changing society--as if good people taking power and knowing exactly what to do with it were an inherently bad thing.

This is a reference to http://www.marxisthumanistinitiative.org/philosophy-organization/the-eternal-sunshine-of-the-vanguardist-mind-how-socialist-alternative-substitutes-opportunism-for-theory.html . We were very pleased to publish it, and I’m in general agreement with it (plus, I have other issues with the CWI), but I’ll refrain from going as far as saying that my critique is “the same.”
 “Do you think there is a connection between their political opportunism and their rejection of TRPF?”
For sure. I see 2 connections. First, the political opportunism takes the form of support for or accommodation to the politics of the left union bureaucrats. And these bureaucrats never want to acknowledge that the capitalist system has serious problems, much less that it is in crisis. Their line, vis-à-vis one company, is that the company is actually hugely profitable, and it could give its workers more and still thrive, but it just doesn’t want to, because of greed. And their line vis-à-vis the whole economy is basically the same thing. It’s really not possible to reconcile this stuff with Marx’s law of the tendential fall in the rate of profit and his economic crisis theory.

Second, what the CWI adheres to is a so-called “multi-causal” theory of economic crisis (I have already addressed, above, why the charge of mono-causality is wrong, at least to characterize my view). They think in terms of a basket of basically *unconnected* causes.

"&gt; Capitalism is going to collapse based on its own internal contradictions. 

The fact that this is still being taken as a given, after two world wars, countless economic global crises, mass periods of progressive social unrest, and crossing over an irreversible ecological crisis-line, is completely ridiculous. Capitalism is built to adapt itself over and over again to keep itself alive regardless of any internal contradictions it's established on. The only contradiction that absolutely ensures capitalism's collapse is total ecological collapse, and if it takes that to end capitalism, then I'm pretty sure that's missing the forest for the trees. 

Capitalism will always bring itself into moments of revolutionary crisis, opportunities where the system is near failure and we have as the people have a choice to make about whether to keep it alive, or tear it down. And being able to tear it down means needing to have strong, healthy, organized communities in place who refuse to participate in the system any more, and who arm themselves to fight back against the system as they engage in revolution.

- Human nature  
- Crony capitalism

"&gt;I just saw Birth of a Nation

Wheeew.... That was kind of a misleading statement. The movie you saw was ""The Birth of a Nation"" which is the same name of a famous disgustingly racist 1915 movie praising the KKK.

&gt;I mean two wrongs don't make a right

White people &gt;:(

I once had to see Selma on a field trip and after I asked the white kids in the class if they would have joined the Freedom Riders if they were alive in the 1960s their responses were basically ""nah itdidn't involve me (whites)"". When they asked the question to me I said I would have joined the Black Panther Party, and their responses were basically ""lmao your so funny, aren't they like terrorists tho?"".",socialism,0
"The number of times I run into that, vocabulary appropriation, is infuriating. Black is white, up is down, etc. You see it so much in the names of far/alt-right organizations so much. It's how they wrangle support from regular people who aren't giving much thought to something. Like The Institute for Historical Review, a holocaust denial organization, or American Free Press, another anti-Semitic organization.",socialism,0

"Why is it impossible to abolish capitalism through the bourgeois state? The modern state has tremendous power - if socialists captured the state democratically, why couldn't they use it to institute socialism?

Edit: I understand it would be enormously difficult, I just don't see how it would be ""impossible.""",socialism,0
"I'd not going to argue that politician couldn't spin it into another way to look down on people without paying work, but for accuracy's sake I'll point that one the key ideas in UBI is the universal part - everyone gets it. Every adult at least. Whether there's an additional payment for children is debated, because people have strange ideas about parents pumping out babies for a little extra money.",socialism,0

"Go to r/AlternativeLeft and tell me that it's ""left wing"" in any meaningful sense of the word. 


Just look at the graphic at the top of the page. Fashy as fuck. It's about as fashy as the ""National Bolshevism"" flag. 

The fact that the author treats the association between Bernie supporters, anti-Hillary people, or even DSA as ""alt left"" in the first paragraph makes it seem like he is repeating shitty alt-right propaganda almost. 

 I know that the essay later explains this, but when I read this, it sounded dangerously wrong and stupid.
