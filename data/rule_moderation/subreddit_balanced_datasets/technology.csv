"In case anyone is wondering: 

- No, data caps do not solve congestion. Congestion is a function of bandwidth, not data. It is [over]saturation of bandwidth. This is a result of ISPs offering more bandwidth than they can actually handle at once, and is called ""overselling"". This, an sich, is not bad, granted measures are in place to prevent congestion. The main measure, utilized mostly, is dynamic bandwidth throttling during congestion. Meaning, everyone gets a bit lower bandwidth, to keep the lines stable. This is common. So, congestion is already solved.

- No, data caps on mobile networks are not justified either. Mobile networks and cable networks are limited in the exact same way: bandwidth. For neither type of network it matters how much data it has already send you. Hell, let's go even further: for literally *any* kind of information transfer, ranging from telecommunication to even quantum mechanics shizzle, *bandwidth* is the limited factor. Data is unlimited so long as the universe hasn't died from the heat death, reaching maximum entropy.

- No, [insert literally any other argument] is not a justification for data caps either. There is no technical justification for them. ""But muh business decision"" - yes, that's the *reason*, not the justification.

"great.  r/conspiridolts is leaking.

There are a lot of us out here working for genuine, reality-based political reform and this idiocy is counterproductive.  No, there is no ""huge {election} fraud scandal"" or wide spread (or even small scale) changing of votes in machines ""that we all know exists.""  Even here in Chicago/Cook County/Illinois, there is no evidence that anyone is altering votes inside the machines or the counting process.

In reality, Republicans are putting a lot of effort into things like gerrymandering, voter suppression, targeted voter ID laws, sending lots of fast, new machines to conservative areas and a few slow, old machines to urban areas, and so on to skew voting.  Chicago/Cook County style corruption plays out in voting through stuff like patronage hiring where to get/keep your job you have to ""volunteer"" to campaign for the right people and you encourage your relatives/neighbors to vote for certain people because if they're voted out, you'll be replaced with that other person's patronage hires.

In all these cases, people are going to a lot of effort to manipulate **who** casts votes to their favor.  But they do this precisely because they don't have the ability to alter the votes within the machines or in the counting system.  If they could, then we wouldn't see all this stupid crap going on so publicly (because in reality, corrupt politicians aren't smart but they are comparatively lazy.)

We absolutely do need to improve our voting equipment to make it even less likely/possible to manipulate votes in the course of casting them, counting, etc.  Every voter should generate a human-readable paper ballot, which they can see/review, and then that should be what is collected/counted.  There should be mandatory, random audits across states/districts of human counts which verify any automatic counting method and overall vote collection/totals.  We need stronger national (thus federal) standards for all of this.  We need to crack down on partisan gerrymandering.

But outside of conspiridolt-world, no, there is a huge lack of evidence that election fraud is anything like common, and blathering about it distracts from real improvements for our democracy.",technology,1

"Using a throwaway here because this directly relates to what I do.

First off, I'm active special forces, and this is my 10 years experience opinion.

In this scenario, The active army will have some deserters, but it's hard to put a percentage on it, most of the military ""does what its told, and puts the lotion on the skin"" much like nazi Germany, they will do unimaginable things because of orders/ Duty.  And its their job, its how they make money, if they route they lose everything. They won't do so unless it is absolutely last resort. 

Reservist and national Guard have a life, a job.  Most likely they will choose what they believe vs what they have to do.  At the end of the day, they are still a pharmacist, laywer, burger flipper. 

Special operations is the game changer.  One of our many jobs is to take a few guys (let's say 12?) And make an army. We do so by going into a foreign country with government issues, find a group who believes in the values we want to enforce. We have little to no resources, ""very particular set of skills "" ie, multiple languages, job knowledge, survival,  field craft, without going into specifics. 

 A man, or a few men, or 12, Can create an army of a hundred, thousand or thousands with our knowledge, and in turn, we are the insurgents that overthrow the current government.

All that said, our guys aren't all going to route, but many will. We don't have the same mentality as the regular military.  We have other skills that make us valuable versus just being a infantryman. Most of us are successful civilians who wear the uniform because of what we believe, not for a job.  

This is why the 2nd ammendment is so important, you take weapons,you take our ability to defend against a tyrannical government.  Now of course, we make our own.  And have other means of obtaining them, but how much easier if everyone already has one, all I have to do is train you how to properly use it in many scenarios.

You're implying a need for hardware to to have good blocking which just isn't the case as shown by the numerous extensions in this comment section. This makes it seem like privacy is something you need to spend money to get which just isn't true.

Also you're adding another device to use electricity and increase your network lag for no reason because everyone can do this right now. All Pi-Hole is doing is adding yet another networking device to your workflow (step 3: configure DNS). It's completely solved by editing your local hosts file with one such as [Someone Who Cares](http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/) which you can also do at your router level (on some routers). Additionally if you're on a laptop, modifying the local hosts file brings the privacy instructions to you.

Not to mention the setup instructions curl-piping into bash while claiming to be a privacy tool. Ugh.

**tl;dr** hosts level blocking can be done without a rasp pi and you can do it _right now_ and have _better performance_ without spending any money, use your router or modify your local hosts file to add a list such as [Someone Who Cares](http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/).",technology,1

"The idea of the alternative roots is to be able to create new gTLDs (generic top level domains).  The alt roots will resolve existing stuff just fine (.com), but they allow creation of new domains like "".joesowndomain"" as a top level domain.  For profit, of course. 

The DNS root is used to find the DNS servers for the top level domains like .com, .edu, .UK, and so on.  Each of those domains  (except sort of for .com) has their own independent organization that does the book keeping and runs the DNS for the entries in that domain.  ICANN has no access to the DNS for things like amazon.co.uk or www.state.gov, and only very indirectly for .com since they contract that out to Verisign. 

For instance, the .UK ccTLD is run by a British non-profit named ""Nominet"".  Other country code TLDs are run by their governments, and some are even contracted out to commercial companies (.CC, for the Cocos islands, is run by a Verisign subsidiary). 

Edit: What matters far more are the little publicized fights over the DNS servers that your PCs and phones use - at your ISP or cell company.  For instance, Quebec is trying to block access to external gambling web sites by mandating that the ISP DNS servers not resolve them - all in trying to protect the Quebec lottery.  Every once in a while an ISP is caught messing with DNS to profit themselves, or to track people on their network. Country-wide censorship is sometimes done by telling ISPs what they can and cannot resolve (see Britain). The sheer number of people using Google's DNS (8.8.8.8) gives them the potential for massive user tracking. 

Edit2: What changed hands was stewardship of the ""root zone"" file. If you want to see what it contains, it is at https://www.internic.net/domain/root.zone.  As you can see it doesn't contain the names of any hosts that users be interested in, it is all ""glue"" that ties the world together. Anyone wanting to affect a single web site has to do something other than mess with this file.

Having the person's body be obscured completely, and voice disguised prevents any form of discrimination or bias.

2) Juries are specifically not told a multitude of powers that they have as a jury. Such things as jury nullification in where the person is obviously guilty but the law is completely bullshit would allow the jury to essentially ignore that law and allow the person to go free. We have so many archaic or overbearing laws currently and with our elective representatives literally refusing to do anything it leaves us with a lot of people going to jail for bullshit.

3) The system essentially rates people of the court based on how many people they put away and how long they put them away for which turns into how they can go for different political offices. This is a complete and utter disgrace because it's so clearly a conflict of interest. You should not be allowed to go from member of the court to some political office based on your performance in the court because of how easily you can manipulate that and with it increase the suffering of many people.

4) We push so many people who are innocent or just plain ignorant/unintelligent to take plea deals because it's easier then going to trial and helps out the court's record. Many times they are basically told they are going to jail for life or etc... and it scares the crap out of people to the point that they will agree to things even though they are completely innocent. This really comes up horribly when it's two kids who are dating in high school and they sext or w/e which then makes some overzealous cop or parent push to make the other kid a rapist or having child pornography. There are entirely too many people who dated a girl in high school while they were a senior in high school themselves that are now on the sex offender list.

5) That sex offender list is bullshit because all it does is continues to punish someone who has already done their time. It also needlessly creates panic in those around them leading to many attacks by the public targeting that person on the list. The list itself can have people on it that did such stupid and generally non-offending things like urinating in public or so. Even if you're at a camp ground and you pee outside in the forest some jackass cop and snag you and there goes the rest of your life all because of that stupid list.

6) The public defenders of the US are completely over burdened and over worked while also lacking a significant amount of resources. This is one of the fundamental foundations of our constitution and it's kept at such an anemic level that it almost guarantees a guilty verdict every single time. It should be one of the most funded services because it has to do with people's lives being thrown away into jail all because they can't afford to get good representation. It's bullshit.",technology,0

Lets say ICANN for some reason blacklists you and your domain. They need every single ISP on the planet to agree with them. People like to think that ICANN is this sort of boss and everyone else is an underling. The reality is that ICANN is this guy who says ""lets all do it like this."" and everyone else is like ""mmhh... ok"", and sometimes people say ""neh"".

There exist jurisdictions on this planet where DNS is used as a filter and DNS lookup is affected in the jurisdiction. This doesn't have a cascade effect to other places. Lets say China wants to erase www.tiananmenmassacre.com from their DNS. They pass a law, all ISPs in China don't show that website yet everywhere else the site is visible. Lets say they lobby ICANN to do the same. ICANN agrees. The US doesn't agree. Europe doesn't agree. Same deal; the site is blocked in China, but not in the US or EU.

Even then, this is a bit silly because a DNS block doesn't do anything. It is the equivalent of blocking off a street by taking down the street sign. It will not stop anyone who knows where the street is, and it in no way stops people from telling others ""the street is over there"".

"Let's say I make audio equipment, and for years I have made incompatible shit to gain an industry advantage. Now would be the time for me to do an about-face and get with all the other audio equipment vendors and create a standard interface for interacting with all audio/video devices over the network. After doing this, I have this standard interface and it doesn't matter whether Amazon or Google use it, but it is there. Now Google or Amazon can use this interface freely and it works on every device.",technology,0
