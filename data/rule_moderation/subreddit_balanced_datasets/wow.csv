"For real, man. I officially retired from regular raiding, opting to help my guild if necessary. I had quit WoW after HFC, and honestly what used to be a very capable, softcore raiding team at the start of WoD is now a shadow of its former self. If I didn't like the guild members as much as I do, I'd have already moved guilds/servers, and I'm on the fence right now mostly because of how bad they did at normal EN.

My guild got Nythendra down on the first night, spent the rest wiping to Ilgy. Night two they got Ilgy, Elerenthe and Ursoc.

I was with them night one filling in as a replacement tank, but their tank showed up so I was out for night two. I pugged into a group with the LFG title ""nigga nigga bitch nigga nigga"" and ""JOIN IF YOU HAVE A BIG PENIS"" and we downed the 4 dreamsmen and Cenarius with only a couple wipes on dragons/Cenarius since a lot of us had never done the fights before, or even much research going in.

"It's psychological. The amount of loot per mob killed varies. Sometimes you'll get a solid gold or two, the other times a little more or less. Sometimes they'll have one grey, two greys, no greys. But you don't get any less loot for killing ten at once vs ten one at a time",wow,1

"wow, those are big words coming out of a retard like you.",wow,1
"I always welcome some advice.

My talents at the moment are: Eye of the Tiger. Celerity. Black Ox Brew. Black Ox Statue. Healing Elixir. Special Delivery. High Tolerance.

It's too early for me to be playing with Blackout Combo, it's messy when I try. Statue over Leg Sweep because I sometimes have a hard time picking up adds. Special delivery over Jade wind because it's fun as hell, does good damage, and doesn't require pressing a damn button every six seconds like clockwork. I like the decision-making of BrM and I feel RJW has no decision in it.

As far as playstyle, I usually pull with keg, pop ironbrew, fire, punches here and there. Keg always ASAP. Maintain ironbrew. Purify if stagger gets in high yellow.

For boss fights or big packs I pop 3 ironbrews immediately, keg and punch until I get a charge, ironbrew it, then black ox brew and use those to purify if need be or to maintain iron.

I try to use explokeg when my stagger is high and I don't have enough charge to purify so I can get 3 seconds damage free.

Forti brew is a good oh-shit button that I tend to forget, I need to do a proper weak aura for it.

One thing I feel I struggle with: unexpected adds. If fire and keg are on cooldown, I tend to panic, try to taunt one, punch another, but it means moving around a lot which isn't always good. Sometimes I pop the statue when I feel there's no danger of aggroing another pack. I *really* can't understand why they removed Dizzying Haze, it really was a great tool that perfectly fit the fantasy.

The other thing where I struggle: say I had to pop black ox brew on a big pack. Next big pack I have few charges. Say I pop two on iron, then I have to purify, and now I have no charges and my stagger is high and I'm kind of panicking. Maybe it's because my haste is still very low, so the cooldown on my brews hurts.

If you have some advice I'll gladly take them.

"> They've tried to appeal to a business and **failed**

Here's where I disagree with you: they didn't fail. It's only been 4 months. If we've learned anything, Blizzard moves at a *monumentally* slow pace, as they have everything planned well in advance. Just because they hadn't heard anything recently, doesn't mean that they'd never hear anything, nor does it mean that Blizzard wasn't actively making plans in regards to legacy servers.

No, this is Nostralius throwing a teenager's temper tantrum because they got tired of waiting. The truly unfortunate thing is this is going to be in the back of the mind of Blizzard anytime they reach out to a community like this, and a pretty big reason for them to stay away.",wow,1

im calling it right now, quote me on this. 7.2 or 7.3, depending on the release dates of the patches WILL have us going to argus (if only a small area of it) and the last raid of the expac will likely be either an old god boss that found its way onto the planet.

that, OR we fight a weakened form of sargeras as a trial to see if the titan egg azeroth is able to be protected (by us, random people on azeroth) from the old god corruption, which leads to him not destroying azeroth.

this leads into the next expac where we either defend against a void lord that manages to make his way into our universe, alongside sargeras

Seems completely absurd on cleave of ~2 targets and very, very good single target, but again it's experimental and the masters of the spec are keeping mostly quiet.

Why are all anti-legacy people so short-sighted?? I keep hearing this imaginary notion that pro-legacy people are the bad ones, when everytime a thread like this pops up you have hundreds of people attacking anyone who thinks vanilla was a good game in it's own right.

Sure, it would take some dev time, but it would be worth it, not just because i would like to play it, but because the vanilla experience to me is an experience any gamer should have the access to experience, they shouldn't have to go the illegal route.

Making legacy servers would solve 3 problems, not one, first you curb the private server people, second it provides a game  that is considered one of the most influential games in history a platform in which it can still be legally played today, and third it provides current wow subscribers with an option to experience raids/dungeons that are mostly gone/redone, as a way to experience content between patches.

Half of your parses you're dead for the majority of the fight so it's hard to get a good read on those.

On Cenarius you have 22 healing surge casts. That's absurd. You should like never be healing yourself. A random spot heal if you're out of range of the boss and going to die and can't move if you're rooted or something but.. what?

Your flameshock uptime is 90% which is rather low.

YOu have 11 casts of ghost wolf which is again time you're NOT spent doing damage.

You used elemental mastery hella late. On a 8 minute fight you have 3 elemental masteries off when you can get off 4.

Similarly you have 4 stormkeeper casts when you can get off 8.

You ddidn't cast earth shock enough. You casted earth shock at 3:25 and again at 4:38. It does not take that long to build 100 maelstrom. From your resource chart it seems like you're just dumping maelstrom into something. Flameshock spam? 15 is very low for an 8 minute fight.

"Well, you do have 1+ seconds of GCD so you don't gain that much by simply mashing your keyboard with 10 clicks a second.  

There is also a lag tolerance in game, which means that your ability is registered (and it will cast as soon as your current cast is over) even when your current cast (or GCD for instant spells) has 0.2 seconds remaining for example, so the guy that mashes his button and the guy that hits his ability every 1.8 seconds for example (for a 2 second cast ability) will do the same dps. 

But ofcourse there many types of disabilities, something else might be keeping them from doing optimal dps.  It could also be a player distracted by something, a cat, their kid jumping on their lap, someone asked them a question in the middle of the encounter, etc etc. 

Whatever scenario is going in the background, it never helps to flame someone for doing bad dps, you will not make them improve like that, if you are really wiping because of damage, just whisper them personally with a nice tone, that might actually encourage them to concentrate and try to do better.

I personally find that if people at the start say they're new, it's easier for me to slow down and be patient.

Opener: Usually you want to Garrote from stealth -&gt; Mutilate -&gt; Rupture at ~3-4 cp.

If you have the Artifact trait ""Urge to kill"" (refills your energy when you trigger vendetta) use it when you run out of energy in this period, otherwise use it with your 2nd rupture. After that you want to envenom at 4+ cp, -&gt;Kingsbane, then continue building 4+ cp-&gt;Envenom until you need to refresh your bleeds.

"A better way to address this issue would be to mitigate the effects of a player leaving. Perhaps if someone leaves the party, the group leader is given the ability to pause the timer in order to find a replacement. This ability should have some restrictions in order to prevent abuse:

1) The group must be out of combat to cast the timer
2) Using Pause will automatically make the group ineligible for bonus loot, to disincentivize abuse
3) Enemies cannot be attacked while in Pause, and they remain stationary, to prevent people from gaming patrol routes in some way
4) CDs stop regenerating, in order to prevent Bloodlust abuse; this should be easy to implement because the technology for CD slowdown is already there, see DKs
6) Everyone must be in the instance to cast Pause, and Pause is cancelled if anyone exits the instance, to prevent people from hearthing and respeccing
7) The person who leaves doesn't get loot, but he does get the 'credit' from the Mythic+ if the group finishes in time, to go towards his weekly bonus chest -&gt; in case guild groups kick a PuG to invite a friend, at least the poor PuG gets some form of credit
8) The Pause only lasts for ~30 minutes, so that people can't just Pause the instance for a few hours while they take a break

I acknowledge that allowing groups to take replacements means that there will be those group leaders that kick PuGs at the last boss and replace them with a friend. However, I think that is preferable to one person screwing an entire group because:
a) only one person gets screwed, and
b) as per #7, they get credit of some kind",wow,0

"I think some healers have to wrong mindset about hp bars in general.  
As a disc priest i see the hp bars of my party as resource. Or more importantly MY resource. As long as the resource is available i can do my thing and play my game (doing damage, preventing the group from getting damaged, preventing people from wiping us, healing, doing mechanics etc). If one of my resource bars runs out someone made a mistake and i will try to figure out what the mistake was and making sure it's not happening again.  
From my experience if a DPS dies it's almost always nobodies or the fault of the DPS. One of the following things probably happend:  

* The DPS was standing in fire and i wasn't able to heal them in time  
* Other DPS are standing in fire and i chose to heal them instead of our now dead DPS  
* The Tank was standing in fire and i chose to heal him instead of our now dead DPS  
* My Mana is empty because too many people are standing in fire  
* Because of high AOE damage i chose to let our DPS die to save me and the others  
* The party is under geared and the damage was too high to heal  
* I made a mistake  

Notice how some of the points are nobodies fault or someone else fucked up and our DPS just got the short end of the stick. So just because they died does not mean it was your fault AT ALL.  

The problem (or you could say misunderstanding) is that a lot of DPS think it's their job to do damage and your job as a healer to keep them alive, but they don't understand that in order to deal damage you need to be alive. So the #1 goal of a DPS should be to stay alive during the whole fight (or die at the end if you're a shadow priest). It is the responsibility of the DPS to take the least amount of damage possible so the chance of him dying is the smallest possible.

Most of the mechanics in EoA are done by the DPS, second boss comes to mind where the tank needs to tank the boss and the DPS need to nuke the 2 add heads.  
If something goes horribly wrong (in Mythic+2 anyway) then the mechanics weren't properly handled and you cannot heal a not handled mechanic if you're not over geared. 

I am not saying here that it's never the healers fault oh god no. Slow reaction time and a bad used GCD is all it needs to cause a wipe if you're playing healer but that is the responsibility you chose when you selected healer as a role, but there are more things to consider if someone dies or the group wipes. You can almost always ask yourself what you can do better as healer to heal away a mistake someone else made (expect when people stay inside Il'gynoth in EN).

this is irrelevant because I am not arguing for keybinds being superior, I am arguing for keybinds being equal.

There's no reason to assume it's fixed, honestly. Considering the rarity of legendaries don't you find it a bit strange that so many people loot more than one in such a short time?

"Skada is by far more accurate, I didn't know people actually thought recount was better. Skada records effective time meaning if you're in combat it still lowers your DPS on the meter, recount doesn't it will pause while you're moving ect.
