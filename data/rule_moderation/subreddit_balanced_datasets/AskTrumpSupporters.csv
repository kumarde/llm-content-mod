"To be fair,


She acknowledged in her own statement that the EO was deemed lawful by the Office of Legal Counsel (part of the DOJ).

Here's some scholarship on the matter: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/01/30/acting-attorney-general-orders-justice-department-attorneys-not-to-defend-immigration-executive-order/

Here's the synopsis
> A few quick observations. First, the statement seems to indicate that the executive order was reviewed by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which apparently concluded that the executive order was lawful. Second, Yates does not claim that she cannot defend the executive order because it is unconstitutional or because the Justice Department would be unable to offer good-faith arguments in defense of its legality. To the contrary, Yates claims she is ordering the Justice Department not to defend the executive order because it is not “wise or just.” This is quite significant. I am not aware of any instance in which the Justice Department has refused to defend a presumptively lawful executive action on this basis. 

> There is some precedent for this sort of thing. Recall the “Saturday Night Massacre,” when Attorney General Eliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckleshaus resigned rather than fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox at President Nixon’s insistence. If AAG Yates believes she is being asked to do something that violates her conscience — as she apparently does — this is the model she should have followed.",AskTrumpSupporters,1

Voting fraud. Many jurisdictions allow illegals to vote, and without voter ID laws they're able to do so multiple times. Not to mention that George Soros (an infamous democratic donor) owns the voting machines, making it easy to falsify votes.

This is beyond any candidate, political stance, or news organization.

You're either a troll, emotionally damaged, or just dumb. You have to trust people every day - why cross the bridge if you don't trust the civil engineer?

Trust is worthless.* I thought liberals were the babies. Grow up and engage in discussion like someone who gives a damn about this country.

Regardless of all of this trust nonsense you are using to confuse the topic, **conflicts of interest in the white house are incredibly dangerous, and an issue that every president has taken seriously**. I agree that it's reasonable to think he is in progress of divesting, **but shouldn't you be skeptical of him?!** Maybe collect some thoughts from your deep-well of mistrust you seem so eager to drink from.

Really? The entire media is an extension of the democratic party? C'mon, get serious. No media outlets supporting the right? None at all?

This example, for instance. I'm not so sure I would go out of my way to accept this as a scandal (though some clearly might), but it is at least note-worthy that presidential are attending an event held by people with such strong anti-LGBT views. 

I think we've reached a time in this country where we need to move passed the LGBT bigotry. Some people are LGBT, and there's nothing wrong with that. I've known *many* people who are, and you know what? They're just people, just like any other people.

As an independent thinker, I wish politicians would stop making being gay a campaign issue except for the purposes of saying ""all groups should be treated equally"", and I think the media probably *should* point out when major politicians are meeting with groups who support outright discriminatory behavior towards a particular group, on either side of the political aisle. If a presidential candidate is being lobbied to support discriminatory practices, I think it’s completely fair for us to know about it.

No, it wasn't.  It was about nationalism, patriotism, infrastructure building, immigration, healthcare, and yes about taking care of business abroad.

2)  Pence is highly qualified and is an active vice-president.  This will be unlike any presidency we have ever seen.  Trump is using all of the tools at this disposal.  If you look at a business you have the CEO/President and then the people who are delegated to.  That is how Trump knows how to get results and he is already getting them.

3)  Obama requested multiple briefings a day, Bush had a routine.  They ran the Presidency with the template they had.  Trump isn't giving rhetoric.  He is doing what he knows to be effective.  He is building a cabinet with the best people he can.   Once that is in place then he can take their advice.

4)  The guy's work ethic is unmatched.  He understands that we have threats foreign and domestic.  He can't pretend to address them if he doesn't have the right folks in place.

The logic is that democracy is being undermined by people in the media and currently in power. If you can't realize that is happening, or how that affects Democracy I can't help you. But understand how it happened in France with DSK, because this is the exact same thing happening here. The fact that you are ok with our Democracy being undermined because you want your candidate to win, is fucking scary as hell.

Immigration

1. Build a wall, deport all undocumented immigrants.
At the core of Donald Trump's campaign is a promise to build a wall across the United States' southern border and deport the country's 11 million undocumented immigrants with the help of a ""deportation force.""

2. Deport all undocumented immigrants but bring the 'good' ones back legally. Dreamers can maybe stay.

In a CNN interview in July, Trump said, ""I want to move them out, and we're going to move them back in and let them be legal, but they have to be in here legally.""

Trump wavered on what to do with the Dreamers - young undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country by their parents as children and are now afforded limited protection from deportation but no path to citizenship. When asked if Dreamers would have to go back, he said, ""It depends.""

3. Dreamers cannot stay.

In August, that ambiguity was gone: ""They have to go,"" he said on ""Meet the Press.""

4. Trump might be flexible on actually deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants.

BuzzFeed reports that in off-the-record talks with The New York Times, Trump admitted this was just bluster and a starting point for negotiations, saying he might not deport the undocumented immigrants as he's promised. Trump has refused calls to release the transcript, despite furious requests from his rival candidates.

5. Deport undocumented immigrants, but don't call it ""mass deportations.""

""President Obama has mass deported vast numbers of people -- the most ever, and it's never reported. I think people are going to find that I have not only the best policies, but I will have the biggest heart of anybody,"" Trump told Bloomberg News when pressed about his immigration policies.

When asked more about how he'd characterize the deportations at the center of his immigration policy, Trump said he ""would not call it mass deportations.""

6. A deportation force is ""TBD.""

Trump's newly hired campaign manager dodged questions on the deportation force in August before saying that Trump's much-talked about deportation force from the primary was ""to be determined.""

7. ""I'm gonna do the same"" as past presidents

Trump championed President Obama's immigration strategy -- deporting criminals first -- in an interview with Fox News when asked about how he'd deport 11 million illegal immigrants, while dodging talk of how he'd handle those who aren't criminals.

Current position: Deport millions, criminals first, and potentially with a deportation force, but don't call it ""mass deportations.""",AskTrumpSupporters,1

Its the other way around. But usually it is made in china and assembled in Mexico then sold in the US.

>Will these businesses just pass on this tax to their consumers? 

Probably. The rise of prices will also make locally made goods finally marketable. This will lead to one of 2 things - bringing back jobs or lower costs and revealing their massive profit margin. The biggest public secret of the outsourcing is the prices never got much lower. Since consumers were comfortable paying the old rate they simply pocketed the new margin opened by the cheaper labor as they should.

This Trump phenomena though has tested my understanding of what constitutes a sane and rational mind. I don't know if you have some sort of disorder preventing you from separating fact or fiction; or perhaps you have some sort of cognitive dissonance disorder. 

Or perhaps, like Herr Trump himself you suffer from narcissistic personality disorder and cannot ever accept that you may be wrong. Through the course of our debate I have proven - beyond all shadow of doubt - that Trump is being willfully dishonest and deceptive when he claims that he was 'opposed to the war from the begining'. This is demonstrated by: 

1. A quote of him from 2002 where he EXPRESSES SUPPORT FOR THE WAR (the complete opposite of what he says he did) and; 
2. A complete absence of any evidence supporting Trump's claim to have been against the war from the beginning. 

A person of sane and rational mind could look at those facts - which are undeniable - and come to a single, obvious conclusion - that Trump is a liar. Yet you have *somehow* managed to convince yourself that facts don't matter, that words don't have solid definitions, that somehow Trump's claim that he 'opposed the war from the beginning' can be explained by his ""Yeah I guess"" answer.

2) He seems very uninterested in the day to day operations of business operations across the board. It seems like Ivana Trump was more interested in their tax positioning than Donald was during the period in question. 

3) Trump has spent an enormous amount of time rhetorically talking about those that ""aren't paying their fair share"", whether that be welfare recipients, immigrants, NATO or trading partners. In the end, it turns out that he himself was a net loss to federal tax payers - the combination of cynicism (""Well, what I did was smart, public good be damned"") and hypocrisy is sort of what gets my blood boiling. 

I have held a negative impression of Trump's political aspirations from the moment he declared his candidacy - from the moment he filed his MAGA trademark in 2012 due to his behavior towards the Atlantic City community, which I was intimately familiar with. This goes beyond a normal business failure, beyond risk taking - he sells people on the idea that he is great at what he does without demonstrating his capability.

"&gt; I question the premise here. Those have been competitive states for years, just because they've gone blue in the last couple cycles doesn't mean anyone gave up on these.

Demographics matter. States that have gone blue in the past few cycles have been considered blue going forward due to changing demographics &amp; these states weren't on anyone's radar as going Republican during the primaries. The fact that Trump has brought in millions of people who never voted before, and who never would vote Republican before is the testament for why they are now in play. 

&gt;  This tells us that we have higher 'certainty' towards a particular outcome.

It might tell us that, but I wouldn't bet money on what the polls have said over time. We've seen the polls shift immensely from the start of September to the beginning of October. Not to mention there's still about 20% of the population in these states that hasn't made up their mind. Don't forgot that Stein &amp; Johnson are still taking about 10% of the general vote as well. That 35% is still up for grabs between Clinton &amp; Trump and everyday the polls indicate that people are willing to flip for whom they will support depending on what the story that week is. 

When it was Hillary's health, Trump being calm and sticking to his message and doing out reach to the black community, he went from down 10 to leading. This week when Trumps message has been hurt with stupid tweets, Hillary's lead is back up. The polls are changing and that should be the far more telling reality. That right now anything can happen, and we see it happening every day. Watch what the polls do when they account for the VP debate. Then watch what they do after Sunday. If the averages you elude to stay the same regardless of those two major events, I'd agree with you.

&gt; I'm not sure what exactly Trump can do in the last two debates to undo the undeniable damage he did in the first.

What damage did he do in the first? Also people lose the first debate and go on to win the election all the time. See Obama.

&gt;  If there were undecideds who came away from the first debate feeling like Trump was unstable and easily provoked, will they be convinced he was just having a bad night?

I don't think many undecideds came away with unstable and easily provoked. I think they came away with knows what's best for our economy (the most important issue) &amp; isn't a racist demagogue the media made him out to be. 

Similarly the undecidedes who won't vote for Hillary because she is untrustworthy, do you believe that's it since she proved she was untrustworthy in the first debate (by not releasing her speeches or emails).

It isn't harassment to depose someone who is threatening legal action or making public allegations about your husband.

So yes, smart politics.

And yet Trump supporters bend over backwards to make all of Trumps ethically shady business dealings just to be ""smart business"".  When he uses lawsuits to cow business rivals or people who he feels slighted by, how is that any better than anything you allege HRC did?  There's at least a much more substantial record of him using lawsuits as bullying tactics (e.g. suing people who say he isn't worth what he claims).  At some point you have to move beyond this belief that being a businessman allows for pure ruthlessness and amorality, but that he can shut it off once he becomes president.  Or at the least you have to extend the same moral filter to the Clintons and acknowledge they are at the height of their profession.  Either way it looks bad for Trump, and that's why he shouldn't bring it up.

"You lean more libertarian then I think. 

On the matter of homosexuality I have no problem with it in general but I do not think it should be pushed in schools as something ""normal"" nor do I think it should be legitimized on the same level as a marriage between men and women. Basically what someone does in their bedroom is their business and that is fine. When you try to take it out of the bedroom and promote it as normal such as marriage or with child adoption I have a problem with it.

As far as abortion I think it should be illegal because not only do I view it as murder but it is also depriving a child of it's rights, namely a right to live. That said I think as a society we have opened Pandora's Box and there is no going back. Abortion must remain legal until our society drastically changes because the social unrest and harm to women will be too great otherwise. I do fully encourage shaming women who live promiscuous lives and/or have abortions out of convenience. Just because it is legal does not mean it should be acceptable. That's my take.

Drugs I go back and forth on. I understand you can't stop drug use and maybe we don't even really have a right to but on the other hand I can't abandon our society to such poisons. The war on drugs is a failure but that doesn't mean we have to jump full force in the other direction and just legalize everything.

They told their staff to avoid the area and told them why. You keep pretending this didn't happen?

&gt;I reject the terms of your cult of expert. Wherever there is a credible imminent threat of death or injury to state department personnel in the world the Secretary of State is responsible for taking action to protect those employees. There is no legitimate fodder risk for the sake of remaining politically correct and not offending host country leaders.

You jumped into this discussion with your blanket statements and then readily admitted you don't have access to all the information necessary to make an informed opinion. You still haven't specified what a credible threat is. You keep bandying the term about. Define it. I keep calling you a coward because you keep tossing the term around but have put forward nothing to define what constitutes a ""credible threat"". Or wait sorry you changed it now - a ""credible *imminent* threat"".

&gt;I reject the terms of your tyranny.

Dismissing me as ignorant is a great way to dodge the points I have made. My points still stand.

Wow you have some notions of grandeur! You reject the terms of my ""tyranny""? Do you even know what that word means? No one said you were disqualified from holding an opinion - You would have much more success arguing with people if you actually heard what they said, BTW - What I said was:

Is that ""tyrannical""? FFS you Trump supporters are all the same - ""I'm tired of PC culture!"" ""I'm tired of not being able to speak my mind!"" - yet as soon as someone points out that you're full of shit, you tuck tail and start screaming about - well, ""tyranny"" in this case. 

You do NOT get a security briefing. You do NOT have security clearance (I assume based on your ignorance of these things). You don't even get UNCLASSIFIED briefings from State department and intelligence services. What in the f*ck makes you think that your opinion is worth shit on this matter when you are so obviously in the dark about just about everything regarding it?

Your crappy, uninformed, non-authoritative and ignorant view holds no weight with anyone who knows anything because you've proven time and time again that you have NO CLUE what you're talking about. 

&gt;In the Benghazi situation the denial of requested additional security multiple times is enough to indict Hillary and her State Department for that death. 

Really? Because according to this [article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/28/house-benghazi-report-clinton-attack-military) regarding the Gowdy committee and report states that:

""The report faults the military for its slow response sending resources to the Libyan city during the deadly 2012 attacks on a US outpost, despite clear orders from Barack Obama and the then US defense secretary Leon Panetta.""

That doesn't seem to jive with your quote. Wait wait, let me guess - ""ITS THE LYING LAMESTREAM MEDIA!!!""?

"Well I generally equate the two for the sake of Reddit conversations because most people are young, with no executive experience, have never owned a business, and just buy in to liberal narratives no matter what; I consider them one and the same.

But we DO allow Mexico to tax our exports without taxing their efforts to us.  The treasury refuses to sanction China with currency deflation tactics, which is essentially subsidizing their exports and taxing ours.  

These two things, combined with almost every other liberal policy, are screwing over our national middle market and propping up multinational cpg manufacturers and importers. 

The lack of market competition and consolidation in these sectors is compounding and even further establishing barriers to entry.  

The tech sector is still running off venture capital that was created during the Reagan and Clinton years, but capital investment basically stopped in anything outside the tech service sector, and most of that has been from China and the middle east. 

FDI is a really good thing, but because of the heavy reliance on it, competition is moving to sector disruption (uber vs taxi, Amazon vs retail, Netflix vs cable) instead of entity vs entity competition.

He was having a private convo (I understand that just because it's private, it doesn't mean it's good...remember Donald Sterling?) but I see no sexism here. While the conversation was recorded in 2005, the vagueness of when he tried to move onto this girl make me doubt that any wrongdoing was conducted. It's typical of a guy trying to seduce a girl he likes a lot. While The Donald did say that he tried to have sex with this unnamed woman, it wasn't like a Bill Cosby scenario where he drugged up a woman and had sex with her. He tried and failed to make moves on someone he liked a lot. He also mentioned that the woman was married as if that stood as a barrier towards him pursuing her further. This event could of happened between the times between 1999-2005 when he was single. But until further details come out, I'm going to say this won't affect the campaign.

It's pretty safe to say everyone knows/assumes Trump makes some outrageous statements.  This is just another statement.  The comments were guy talk in a ""private"" conversation.  How many people do you think are actually offended or outraged by the comments? Not manufactured outrage but truly offended?  Anyone (male or female) who says they've never participated in a similar conversation is most likely lying.  They may have not been the ones making the comments, but I'm sure almost everyone at one point in their life has been in a conversation where someone has said something along similar lines.  As far as how it impacts the voter base, I think a large number (male and female) won't really care about the comments.  By this I mean they won't truly be offended by them.  Everyone that supports Hillary will clearly be ""OUTRAGED"" but they were never going to vote Trump anyways.  The vast majority of his supporters will still support him.  He probably does lose a good chunk of the independent votes but again, I still think a surprising number of people will not care about the comments.

Still, saying it is illegal to enter the country without documentation (or, as is mostly the case, overstay your legal entry), therefore illegal immigrants are bad is a valid opinion. The disagreement (when that is the reason), probably just comes down to prioritization. Obama, for example, prioritizes deporting illegal immigrants convicted of other crimes and advocated for using fewer resources to deport children who were brought here illegally. In the finite universe of government enforcement, which groups of illegal immigrants should a President Trump deport? Should he allow limited amnesty for children, or university students to concentrate resources on those ""higher value"" cases of criminals or those suspected of criminal activity? Even with *absolute* resources, enforcement would still have to be prioritized. I guess I am curious, if you *do* think illegal immigrants are so bad, in what order should they be deported?

Depends what you mean by that.

We haven't seen that sort of aristocracy in the world in hundreds of years. You can't deny the results of a well educated upper class.

Well for one the government is always and has always been notoriously bad at doing a job a private corporation could do. This is why we more or less handed space flight to the private sector. And there is also competition which lowers prices. You don't have that when the government is running everything.

Genuine, calm, collected, understands what Americans care about and want.

I almost feel stupid for believing all of the negatives about him that the media told me about. Jesus, what a shame. Thank god he had the opportunity to actually show us who he is.

Kaine is everything wrong about Washington. Fake, interruptive &amp;amp;amp; insulting. Showed no ability to compromise, and showed just how condescending Democrats really are. They only care about equality when it benefits them. God forbid you have alternate views-you're deplorable. So sad.

There was no standoff between the two.  In Syria, Obama and Putin seem to have different objectives and if anything, Putin is provoking Obama.  I really have doubts Trump could even conceptualize what is going on there if he can't even prepare for a debate with someone like Hillary.

Japan's population is in decline in the worst way. The combination of better medicine (read: older people living longer) and more information/ better birth control (read: fewer babies) has resulted in a population that has more old people than young people. That means that Japan is heading towards a point where they're not going to have enough people to do the work that is needed to support the older population. 

To crystallize this in one example, in 2014 Japan sold more adult diapers than baby diapers for the first time in its history. 

The United States would be in the exact same boat, except we have the benefit of being an extremely popular immigration destination. States that don't have many immigrants, like Maine, have seen their populations trend in the exact same direction as Japan, where there are way more old people than young people.

Neither would I. I think cutting subsidies to dirtier forms of energy (coal) in favor of cleaner ones (natural gas) is a valid policy. I think investing in R&amp;D is a valid policy. I think a moderate tax on limited forms of carbon emission is a practical necessity. I don't think any of the three above will destroy the economy or even significantly harm it. Will people lose their jobs? Yes. But by the same token new jobs will be created. It is structural unemployment, so from the macroeconomic perspective, equilibrium will be re-attained. Furthermore, energy and space research have historically had a huge return on investment once the technologies trickle down to the consumer.

"Do you know why black enrollment drops? Because African-Americans have lower grades test scores. Why? Because the schools they go to are complete disasters. Fix that, don't implement some racist program which clearly hasn't worked.

You have to realize that the frustration here is seeing someone with the same grades and extracurricular as you, succeed further, someone who may very well have had an easier life. For instance, I come from a poor, single-parent home that was riddled with mental illness; I get no scholarship or admissions boost for this.

It's your total lack of empathy that can piss people off. Am I a Trump supporter? Hell no, but I can easily see why one comes to be when your reason for the failure of every white person is ""they are just stupid/lazy"", while the failure of everyone else has some systemic cause that of course isn't their fault.

This kind of terrible, exclusionary attitude is exactly why I am struggling to remain a Democrat.",AskTrumpSupporters,0
Doing some charitable things doesn't wash away two divorces and infidelities. Ask yourself how evangelicals would have treated Obama if he was twice divorced with 5 children from 3 marriages. They'd rip him to shreds so why give Trump a pass?,AskTrumpSupporters,0

"Polls matter to a point like that article points out. Generally, state polls for swing states are much more important and reliable than say a poll in a random use or red state. You also need to take a look at the electorate and see historically how much that group come out to vote for their candidate. 

So you aren't wrong in saying too many polls is a bad things, but polls most definitely do matte this far out. Closer to election day, it gets harder to model for, and I mean like days out, not weeks. So for now they can be trusted,  the week before Halloween is when I would start ignoring polls.

"My last paragraph was making fun of shots at Trumps hair.  I don't care what you make of it.

Running a country is democracy when we vote.  Apart from that it is up to the elected to accomplish promises made to the electorate.  If you hate the way businesses are run than just say so, no need to call it a despotism.  

Saying that Trump is ill prepared is actually worse than saying Obama was unprepared as a ""12"" year public official.  Trump has dealt with business internationally, he has dealt with business domestically.  He has dealt with politicians as well as other people who are trying to garner a politician's favor.  Money talks and Trump knows this.  How do you think sanctions are so effective?

Trump knows the cards that America has and is willing to play them, despite when people may cry foul.  I would argue he is more prepared for the office than others who may have been only focused on one particular aspect of a state.",AskTrumpSupporters,0

"Not just when he wins. But in office. Being President is a really hard job, and he wants to win at it. He wants to keep winning no matter what he does, and that includes at being President. So while in office you know at least Trump has a base instinct to do the very best possible because he wants to win. He wants America (the team he represents) to win in the world, he wants his Presidency to win in the eyes of the people, and he wants to win for his personal satisfaction.",AskTrumpSupporters,0
"Well for one they are the only group of people who get called racist for exhibiting in group preference while at the same time they are the only group that can be lawfully discriminated against.

"No you are changing your argument. First you said the audio tape doesn't matter because past presidents have said similar things. Then I disagreed and asked for proof, but you refused to give any. You then switched to, ""why you do you care so much about what a candidate says.""  I said I care a lot and and you said that words of a nominee are unremarkable to you. Now that I challenged you on that, you've gone back to your original argument that it is the *audio tape*, not a president's words that are unremarkable. I again would like to see proof of this but I assume you still don't have any. You can see what non-Trump supporters mean when we say mental gymnastics.

Also undecided voters are absolutely are huge issue right now, what leads you to say otherwise besides your gut feeling? All evidence within scientific polls says otherwise.",AskTrumpSupporters,0

"&gt;I'm sorry refusing to pay the previously agreed upon price with a small business because you know they can't afford to sue you is not tough negotiation

Tbh the few people who came forward with stories about how Trump ""ripped them off"" came off as total losers who were probably in trouble/going out of business anyways. Who wouldn't demand payment up front or incrementally on a big project? These are people that thought ""Oh of course Trump will pay me, hes rich!"", then they went and finished all the work, paying for labor and material out of their own pocket, expecting Trump would pay. Well when they finish the job, they don't have leverage anymore. They deserved it, imo. It shows bad judgement on their part and Trump is within his right to capitalize on it.

&gt;Especially when it is often over amounts of money that mean nothing to a billionaire and everything to someone who is barely scraping by.

That means nothing in the world of business. Just because somebody is rich it doesn't mean they should be expected to pay more for things when they don't need to, what are you? some type of bernie supporter? Like who thinks in these terms? Business is all about the return on your *investment*. One of the best and most overlooked ways to increase your ROI is by decreasing your initial investment using negotiation techniques like Trump has.
