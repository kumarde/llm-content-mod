"&gt;The Homeland Security Department is already considering designating voting systems as critical infrastructure in the future, though it is unlikely to happen before the election, the second official said.

&gt;A presidential directive released in 2013 details 16 sectors that are considered critical infrastructure, including energy, financial services, healthcare, transportation, food and agriculture, and communications. The designation places responsibilities on the Homeland Security secretary to identify and prioritize those sectors, considering physical and cyber threats. The secretary is also required to conduct security checks and provide information about emerging and imminent threats.

Elections haven't been given the ""critical infrastructure"" designation so state authority has primacy over security matters, since elections are Constitutionally in their bailiwick.  There are even R state elections officials who are threatening lawsuits against *federal overreach* if DHS takes over the security responsibilities.  This is on the Republicans.  Again.",politics,0

"&gt;Nope. Most people seem to think democracy refers to a much more specific type of representation than it actually does, and then use that misconception to justify decrying America (or subsets of America) as undemocratic.

All of which doesn't really matter when the current form of democracy *is* failing to represent the majority of Americans.

&gt;I would have agreed with you if you'd phrased it in a less disingenuous way. For example....

Oh. sorry.  I'll be less disingenuous.  Only 14% of eligible voters pick the next presidential candidate.

It is a broken system where the choices are artificially limited based on vigilantly protected duopoly.  I'm not sure how you and say that it is *working* when the two candidates that are allowed to participate in a national debate are   highly disliked and distrusted by an overwhelming number of voters.

"The LA Times poll is unique in that it polls the same group of people day after day. It's interesting and will be good to see how accurate it was when the election ends, but the pollsters already admit that there is some possible bias in it.

&gt;Some analysts think the Daybreak poll is slightly tilted toward the Republican side because of how it accounts for the way people voted in the last election. All pollsters weight their results somewhat to make sure their samples match known demographics; the right proportions of men and women, for example, or blacks, whites and Latinos. The Daybreak poll goes a step further and weights the sample to account for how people say they voted in 2012: It's set so that 25% of the sample are voters who say they cast a ballot for Mitt Romney and 27% for President Obama. The rest are either too young to have voted four years ago or say they didn't vote. The potential problem is that people tend to fib about how they voted. Polls have often found that the percentage of people who say after an election that they voted for the winner exceeds the winner's actual vote. If that's the case this year, then weighting for the vote history would result in slightly too many Republican voters in the sample, which would probably boost Trump's standing by a point or two. Unfortunately, there's no way to know for sure until we can compare the final vote to the poll's final forecast. Given how long it takes to count all the votes, that answer won't be available until at least a week after election day.

Looking at a larger set of polls shows that Clinton gained anywhere from 2-5% nationally, and performed very well in swing states.

"Pssst. You're going to lose and there's nothing you can do about it. Hillary is a terrible candidiate. Unless of course you think that her mysterious supporters who don't vote in online polls, don't show up at her rallies, and don't buy her book are going to show up at the polls. It is truly amazing how people can delude themselves as much as you. lol",politics,0
"&gt; Then tell me the alternative to giving it a shot and trying to hold her accountable.

The only way to hold her accountable is by *not* voting for her!  Voting for her just enables her to lie and not do what she says and validates her belief that she can say whatever the fuck she wants and can get away with it.

Tell me, how do you hold her accountable once she's in office?...she's by definition unaccountable for at least 4 years.  She's going to be despised in 4 years anyway.  That's just who she is.  She's widely despised across the country, even by those who are voting for her.  She's going to likely be a 1 term president, and when the republicans don't run someone as caustic as Trump they will destroy her in 2020.  2020 also happens to be the next census and with Clinton still widely reviled (and I honestly can't see a realistic way she won't be) the republicans clean up house and gerrymander for another generation the house of representatives.

As opposed to taking our chances with Trump.  He'll set us back, no doubt.  He's a total monster with zero qualifications.  BUT...he'll be so disastrous that he will be the one destroyed in 2020, the republican party with him and then the democrats have a real shot at winning back state seats and winning back the house and setting the district lines.  The republican party will have to ""come to jesus"" so to speak and maybe / hopefully actually become a rational counter party and not the batshit insane party it has become recently.  The price we pay for no Trump now could be 10+ more years of republican obstructionism and gerrymandering in the 2020 elections when Clinton actually has to win against a regular republican.

Its an absolute nightmare of a choice, if you can even call it that.

I completely concede Trump is categorically worse than Clinton, absolutely.  There is no argument at all against that assertion.

I don't have a great answer for you.  For me, I am voting 3rd party myself.  I do not accept *at all* that a vote for 3rd party is any way voting for Trump.  Those who vote for Trump help Trump.  My non-vote for Clinton helps Trump just as much as my non-vote for Trump helps Clinton.  I will not vote for Clinton with a proverbial gun to my head.  I will not play that game.  I will vote for the person who best represents me. I will vote as if my ballot alone decides the contest.  

I perfectly understand that absolute horror Trump is.  But Clinton *on her own merits* its utterly unacceptable.  I cannot bring myself to vote for her and I haven't.  I've already voted and mailed in my 3rd party vote.  I'm not happy about it either.  I don't like anyone, but morally, I just cannot vote for the lesser of two evils. I genuinely believe Clinton is a detriment of democracy and I cannot vote for her despite how bad Trump is.
