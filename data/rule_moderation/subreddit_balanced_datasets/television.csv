Two things my article (source below) gets wrong:

1) Trump HAS brought up Epstein's name numerous times against Hillary

2) Epstein doesn't haunt Trump's reputation.

Here's why:

> When asked about a subpoena served to Trump in 2009, Garten said it ""never happened."" The subpoena called for Trump to give a deposition in a case against Epstein; Garten's denial baffled Brad Edwards, one of Virginia Roberts' attorneys.

> ""There is no debate over what happened,"" Edwards told VICE news. ""I served Mr. Trump with a subpoena for deposition in 2009. He talked to me voluntarily, and consequently we withdrew the subpoena in light of his voluntarily providing information…. I can't imagine there being any dispute of any of this.""

> **Edwards also said that it is ""obvious"" Trump himself was not involved in any of Epstein's illicit activity.**


And there you have it. The allegations are false, as stated by the rape victim's lawyer on behalf of the rape victim herself.

If you're a MtF trans woman who transitioned in your early adulthood (as most do). You actually lacked many extremely formational events that young women experience. When did they get their period?

Trans people totally deserve all the rights and respect in the world. But I think its fucking disrespectful to the trials and tribulations that genetically born women go through to assume that men identify and thus transition later deserve the same title.

"“Fuck” can be used as a verb, adverb, adjective, command, interjection, noun, and can logically be used as virtually any word in a sentence (e.g., “Fuck the fucking fuckers”). Moreover, it is one of the few words in the English language which could be applied as an infix (e.g., “Am I sexy? Absofuckinglutely!”; “Bullfuckingshit!”). It has various metaphorical meanings. The verb “to be fucked” can mean “to be cheated” (e.g., “I got fucked by a scam artist”), or alternatively, to be sexually penetrated. As a noun “a fuck” or “a fucker” may describe a contemptible person. “A fuck” may mean an act of copulation. The word can be used as an interjection, and its participle is sometimes used as a strong emphatic. The verb to fuck may be used transitively or intransitively, and it appears in compounds, including fuck off, fuck up, “fuck you”, and fuck with. In less explicit usages (but still regarded as vulgar), fuck or fuck with can mean to mess around, or to deal with unfairly or harshly. In a phrase such as “don’t give a fuck”, the word is the equivalent of “damn”, in the sense of something having little value. In “what the fuck!”, it serves merely as an intensive. If something is very abnormal or annoying “this is fucked up!” may be said.

"> Good question. I think chase was trying to make us feel a certain way, expect something bad to happen, perhaps that was a way of putting us in Tony's shoes. That's why when we see every (potential) threat coming through the doors, it's from Tony's PoV. Every person that comes through Holsten's looks like people who've tried to kill or been killed by Tony... Showing us that there's no knowing who might be behind Tony's life ending event or what they may look like. Maybe it'll be two blacks guys, maybe it'll be a friend, or maybe a random guy in a members only jacket.

fair enough, i just find the whole thing all too convenient. the best way to show someone's death, from a POV, is to black screen... and that's what we get for as far as i know the first time in TV history.

hence the confusion.

> The cat theory, it's hard to say. Throughout the latter half of the series they really started leaning on these almost supernatural aspects, like Paulie with the Medium, Chrissy coming out of his brush with death with ""hallucinations"", and of course, Tony's dreams, etc. I wouldn't totally discount it. It's possible they're all red herrings, though. None of them really seem to lead anywhere, and it seems weird that they'd employ this sort of Shakespearean foreshadowing in a show that was very much rooted in reality. But like I said, it's hard to say. I don't know.

good points. the part that gets me though is how paulie had a bad vibe about the cat after he killed chrissy's GF, and how that cat kept string at the picture of chrissy...

makes you wonder.

> Let me pose this question to you: Why would the hit man need to go to the bathroom first, then come out and shoot tony from behind? Why would he wait around at the bar? 

walking up to some's face, especially someone who's head is on a swivel looking for an assassin, has a much lower success rate than sneaking up behind him and just blasting his brains out all over the table.

doing it this way gives tony zero chance of survival... face to face... it's a dice roll.

so he just sits at the bar, pretending to be a customer eating at the counter... then tony isn't suspicious. if a guy just walks up to him when he first gets there tony might still be sizing everyone up and on guard.",television,1

They seemed to be setting it up so he'd be a glee coach. He was going to be endgame.

So when the season started, they did their well-planned Beatles tribute. Lea Michelle sang ""Yesterday"" in the beginning and it was very sad, but they didn't address him in that episode. Finally they give him his own tribute episode with all the characters responding to grief in different way. They talk about his death, celebrate his life, NEVER mention how he died.

LETS QUEST!!!,television,1
">Do you make or uphold any morality judgments that are not based on scientific evidence? 

Hard for me to say.  It seems pretty likely though.

>I know a lot of people who believe that abortion is morally permissible, but I think it would be stretch to link that belief to a scientific foundation.

Depends on what you mean by scientific foundation. You can take the knowledge science has given us and decide your moral position. You can present an argument based on that knowledge that may be valid. For instance, anti-reproductive-rights people often take the scientific knowledge about when a heart starts beating and hold it up to support their argument. There's a ""scientific basis"" there, but they have no argument that obligates us to accept their view based on that scientific knowledge. 

>Morality in general, really, is very partitioned from science, because it goes beyond the fundamental truth claims of science - how things ARE - and proceeds onward to how things SHOULD be.

Indeed. A moral stance is a decision about what the right answer is to a question which doesn't have an answer.

>Point being, all of us, on some level or another, hold values or beliefs that cannot be based in any scientific foundation.

Of course it can be, as explained above. I can point out that life started several billion years ago. It's factually incorrect that it starts at conception, or at any point along the way during pregnancy. In principle, I think any of our beliefs could have a scientific foundation. That's different from saying we are obligated to believe them by science.

>To then claim that religious people somehow uniquely ""don't understand how to think scientifically"" is a little unfair. 

I didn't say uniquely. There are lots of ways to think irrationally. The religious don't have a monopoly on foolishness. 

>Their scientific/unscientific beliefs are partitioned differently, but again, all people do this in one way or another.

They choose to reject the core scientific principle that beliefs about the world must be justified by evidence. You can't 'partition' your the-earth-is-flat belief from your scientific beliefs and claim you think scientifically.

"Good shilling technique. Criticize just enough, then sell the point. I wonder why that is? It's certainly not likely that the numbers are dropping...

This episode is absolute shit *especially* if you are a ""huge book lover"". It takes a dump on all of Iron Islands. It takes a dump on most of the history of ancient Westeros we've read about and it takes a narrative dump on our beloved hero. Somehow I am really not convinced Martin would come up with something as ""brilliant"". It doesn't even make sense, as most of Bran's adventures in Greenseerland didn't so far.

Ozymandias had great writing. This episode was a steaming pile of shit on level with The Walking Dead. There have been many more and better episodes in the series ( mostly with story and dialogue taken from or based more faithfully on the novels) to take this prize. This episode was written by a fifteen-year old.

But go on. Downvote me like a good shill should.

**Flowers** - Hilarious and crazy. A definite must-watch and could not recommend more. Like a multi-episode arc of Inside No. 9. Always fun to see the charming Olivia Coleman wobbling in her green Umbridge coat. Best comedy this year.

**Fleabag** - Breaking the 4th wall meets /r/me_irl. Relatable series, half-way terrible, unapologetic without any hand-holding needed. Kinda reminds me of Miranda with 10% of the cringe.

**Search Party** - I finished this in one sitting, I probably shouldn't have but it's one of the NY-centric comedies I was able to stomach and even enjoy apart from Broad City. If you didn't like HBO mumblecore, maybe you'll like this more. The characters are terrible people but in an entertaining way. I think the show would've fallen apart with another lead so casting paid a huge part in making it one of the more delightful, self-aware and at times harrowing hipster/crime/comedy hybrid. 

**Rectify S4** (Series Finale) - I had to postpone watching this series because I wasn't in the mood for anything heavy but this season was surprisingly light, with bursts of accidental humor. No matter how sombre it was, it was a heartfelt feel-good show. Thank you Sundance, for bringing the best drama to grace our screens this decade.  

**Humans S2** - Liked it more than the first season and they improved characters and plotlines from the Swedish version. I like their take on consciousness and how they take it from interpersonal to societal level. 

**Travelers** - Interesting concept, hints of Continuum and 12 Monkeys. Pilot was intriguing enough to get me hooked. Plus I'll watch anything that has Eric McCormack in it (growing up watching Will&Grace, and yes I sat through all seasons of Perception). ",television,1

"On the villain comment:

I had the same thought until I went out and read what was being said on the Internet about the villians.  In Daredevil, Kingpin wasn't just a threat, logically, he should have won against a single non-super powered opponent.  We've gotten used to Villians having greater power than the Hero's they face.

Cottonmouth is the ""deer in the headlights"" villian.  Without an opponent with super powers, Cottonmouth would be unstoppable.  But, against someone like Luke Cage, he never had a chance.  He started the conflict with Cage thinking that the world was exactly the way he had always known it, then when it's too late, he realizes that Luke is unstoppable, but never changes tactics, thinking that he could beat Luke using the same tactics that had gotten him to where he was.

This -does- make Cottonmouth different from all of the other comicbook movie villians up to this point.  I kept watching Cottonmouth thinking ""Deer in the headlights"" and expecting him to get hit by gama rays and turn into a hood-monster, but no...  They plot twisted and Cottonmouth actually goes from villian to a point of sympathy almost.

Don't know.  I wont knock the writers on Cottonmouth, they actually did something very different there, and the actor did a hell of a job with what he was given.

The editing was terrible though.

Interestingly enough, this is the exact reason I stopped watching Archer. I used to be such a huge fan of the show, but then it just became too self referential.

A big thing is people have a lot of affection for the presenters, Mary Berry and Mel and Sue, for example. When the production company struck a deal with Channel 4, the story took on this extra dimension because people saw disloyalty in leaving the BBC. Those three presenters choosing to stay with the BBC has only compounded that. I think if they'd stayed with the show and gone to Channel 4, it wouldn't have made much of a splash in the news. But the fact that they've stood by the BBC means the story has become more about loyalty and love for the BBC, with Paul Hollywood cast as a money-grabbing villain for going to Channel 4.",television,0

They either send them off to the city to make money or put them into ""debt"" to one of the mail order agencies that promise to find the daughter a job so she can send back money to the family. 

You sound incredibly ignorant. I've talked to more of these women than I can count, mostly from Thailand and the Philippines and there are so many stories that it's hard to paint a broad brush like you are. But a common thread is that very few of the women were 100% informed and willing.

Are there websites or companies which are totally legit? Sure. 

But largely there are a lot of criminal elements within it. The women are duped and promised things that aren't true. 

To use another comparison, think of the exploitation of foreign labour workers in the Middle East. Companies go to third world countries like Bangladesh and promise people there great jobs overseas with free accommodation. Once they bring them over, they confiscate their passports, force them to live in horrible conditions and treat them as modern day slaves. 

Similarly with mail order brides, many women are brought over to a foreign country with no support network and are totally dependent on a stranger they have only met with a couple of times. This isn't a person they've extensively dated and there is a big power difference. And a person paying for a wife online isn't going to see them as equals either.

Though it does seem that all the outliers come from 2 places; HBO and Netflix.

At worst it's an average how with a very good soundtrack. The first 6 episodes is like a mini arc with a pretty clear stopping point, so you can try that on for size. If you like it, continue on, f you hate it, then stop. ",television,0

"Thing is, I loved the crazy plot elements. They didn't give everything away but they were always building the lore and twisting and turning. It's disingenuous to say it's just about the characters and to not get to into the mysteries when the mysteries are a huge draw for the show. Plus the overall vagueness leaves it up to some interpretation which is why everyone had wild theories. It's a fun interactive experience if you let it be. We know as much as the characters know. Some mysteries just stay shrouded.",television,0

"Yeeeahh, he's not racist. He's a businessman turned politician who wants a wall along the south and no refugees from the disastrous middle east, because some of them will inevitably and without a doubt blow themselves up.

Yeah, i dont think so. *He's from new york, has a narcissistic mentality and a big mouth, and sometimes speaks without holding his tongue* but he's no more racist than the 40-50% of the people voting for him. I will give the media credit where credit is due though. They did a fantastic job dehumanizing him and his common sense ideas along with his suppoeters while protecting arguably the most publicly corrupt/tainted politician in American history. It's astonishing really.

This is the gist of what I say to people who call him racist. He really, is not.",television,0
