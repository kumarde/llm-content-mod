"Witches, sorcerers, ""new-age"" adherents; people of other religions will often leave things behind in buildings they once occupied; if you're moving into especially an older place you should first sweep it clean.  The same kind of supernatural influence is common all over the world; paranormal activity, restless sleep, subconscious recognition that you're not alone when physically you are.  Often there's something left behind, like a ""dreamcatcher"", an idol, etc. - often in a roof space or attic, sometimes in a cupboard.  Put on some gloves, pray, speak authority over the place God has given you to occupy, and destroy the thing (crush, chop up, discard; don't burn).  Wash the gloves.

An artefact will give it the possibility to return, as the abomination is still there.  But sometimes there is no artefact, there was just past rituals (even unwitting ones, like people burning incense from a new-age store) and the thing hasn't moved on.  Prayer is usually sufficient in those cases.  You have the authority and victory in Christ which is why the thing has no power.

In modern times its uncommon for a full manifestation especially in western society.  Some say this is because society has chosen to ignore the spiritual world, I say its probably more do to with the spread of Christianity making it extraordinarily difficult for evil to operate in this manner.  You can't exactly get up to no good when 3/4 people have the power and authority to put an end to it immediately.  This is why there's more subtle approaches like corrupting educational institutions and the media.  When they bring about the anti-Christ we'll see (if we're here when it happens) full manifestation again, undoubtedly, especially as there will be far less Christians and those that do exist will be even more harshly persecuted than what we've experienced to date.

When 95% of Christians killed world wide are killed by those who follow the satanistic teachings of mohamed that is known as islam, yeah that gives me reason for concern.

Let us be clear about this in zero Christian majority state in the western world has there been ANY persecution of gays or muslims that have been lawful. 

If somebody murders a gay person or a muslim in the USA and is caught they will face legal justice and will pay a price for their deed equal to the same crime being committed against somebody else with the added weight of hate crime being added to the list of crimes they're found guilty of. Ironically in America, a Christian majority country, when Christians are killed almost never is the idea of a Hate Crime even considered.

In islamic majority states world wide Christians, gays, Buddhists, Hindu's, Athiests are persecuted openly and with Extreme Prejudice and no non muslim has legal recourse in their defense.

The koran states VERY CLEARLY what muslims should be doing to Christians and Jews and last words out of mohameds mouth before he died was to call for the destruction of the Monkeys and Pigs, he's name for Jews and Christians. The last words out of our Saviour Jesus Christs mouth was 'forgive them Father they know not what they do!', an immense contrast between the two.

So yeah, I'm an ISLAMAPHOBE and NO I will not spare a thought for the muslims that might be prosecuted BECAUSE OUR LAWS PROTECT THEM MORE THAN OUR LAWS PROTECT US! And their countries their laws prosecute US.

I'm sorry, but my main objective is to further the Good News that Jesus died for our sons. I'm not proclaiming myself unless I AM the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, and even then, my objective is to Glorify my Heavenly Father.

""As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens the countenance of another"" This third one is in Proverbs.

This is how I speak daily: ""speaking to one another in Psalms and hymns"". There's a fourth.

I seriously doubt you'd want me to follow you around all day telling you everything that you do wrong. I am doing a good thing. If you don't like what I do, simply ignore it. Because, maybe God will smite you down if you continue to harass me. Or possibly put a curse on you and your family.

2 Corinthians 6:14-18
Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial? Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever? What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said, “I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Therefore go out from their midst, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch no unclean thing; then I will welcome you, and I will be a father to you, and you shall be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty.”

Halloween revolves around this one factor that you yourself admit. Fear/Horror. The holiday itself is about fear. Jack o' lanters, skeletons, zombies, vampires, spiderwebs, graveyards, ghosts, witches, haunted places etc. Costume choices doesn't change the holiday's core which is **FEAR**. Everything that has to do with fear is promoted that day.

For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.

Therefore go out from their midst, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch no unclean thing; then I will welcome you,

Galatians 5:16-21
But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God

Titus 2:12 
Training us to **renounce ungodliness and worldly passions**, and to live self-controlled, upright, and **godly lives** in the present age,

People like you who claim to be Christian and then say ""Halloween is harmless fun!"" only make Christians look like hypocrites. Horror is from the devil, you think it's harmless the Bible does not. Horror is what you find in the place where God is not which is Hell. The only kind of fear God promotes is fear of Himself.

"Romans 9:17-18 / see Exodus 9:13-17
For the scripture says to Pharaoh: “For this very reason I have let you remain: to show my power in connection with you and to have my name declared in all the earth.”  18 So, then, he has mercy on whomever he wishes, but he lets whomever he wishes become obstinate. 

Moses went to Pharaoh in Jehovah's, YHWH, יהוה name.

Jesus came in his Fathers name. John 5:43 

Who are those remaining obstinate in recognizing Jehovah as the Sovereign of the Universe?

"I just want to address your post title, saying that it's ""automatic damnation for being LGBT.""

It's also automatic damnation for lying, cheating, being arrogant, lusting, and all sorts of things that everyone does.  Does the Bible consider homosexuality a sin? Yes, it appears that way.  But so are a lot of things all of us are guilty about. 

Your specific sin doesn't make you any less valuable as a human being or precious to God.  Luckily, the only ""unforgivable sin"" is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Not homosexuality.  

By putting your faith in Christ and receiving forgiveness for being a sinful person (as every single one of us is), God chooses to view you outside of your sin, as a righteous person.  You are saved from Hell, and you are given eternity in Paradise.  

You can still have a wonderful relationship with God as a gay person.  Christ calls us not to judge one another, since we are all sinnners.  People who tell you that you're destined for hell due to your homosexuality are hypocrites. They're destined to the same fate for a different reason.  

Very thankfully, God has ensured that our ability to be morally perfect is not the standard for heaven.  Since that's impossible for all of us.

"No. No No. No no no no. Absolutely not, your reasoning is **toxic** to someone struggling with mental health problems. 

>Jesus is here right now offering to begin the process to cure you. Why are you refusing Him?

I'd just like to point out that guilting and accusations are generally an awful way to start off your twisted version of what I'm sure you call ""witnessing"", ""mentorship"" and/or ""planting seeds"".

>Jesus cured my anxiety and depression.

That's great. Good for you. I will not argue that there are psychologically therapeutic effects related to religion (the community, sociality, feeling purpose, feeling safe, etc.). There are. It's been well documented in multiple studies. That alone can help someone's anxiety, but Jesus can **not** solely be the cure-all for mental health issues! 

Relying entirely on the creator to solve all of your problems is foolishness. And to tell someone to rest their entire state of mental well-being on Jesus is dangerous. Anxiety disorders are real, documented neurochemical imbalances in the brain. Simply believing *extra hard* cannot cure that entirely, and will often lead to further anxiety when it inevitably doesn't work. 

>Jesus tells us not to worry for God takes care of everything.

Really? Perhaps next time I come up short on my phone bill I'll call Verizon and tell them to forward it to Yahweh! Whether you believe or not, you can't sit there and do nothing while simultaneously expecting for God to fix you. 

>I used to have anxiety so bad I would shake and my insides would hurt throughout the day. I put my faith in Him and that all went away.

Good for you! But we're all individuals. We don't all follow the same path as you. 

I used to believe that Jesus could fix my anxiety. I'd beg and plead late into the night, often to the point of tears and complete, resigned frustration, for Jesus to just take away the fear, the pain, the anger, the traumatic memories..

But it wasn't enough. And after kicking myself for so long, because *of course* it can't be God's fault for not having fixed me, I took my problems to a mental health professional. Thanks to years of being taught in the church that medications were a crutch and that all you need is good ol' Jesus, I was resistant to medication for months. I sunk deeper and deeper. And then came the suicidal thoughts, and I knew in that moment that enough was enough. 

They gave me Zoloft for my PTSD, depression and anxiety. 

They gave me Adderall for my ADHD. 

They gave me Trazodone so that I could finally fucking sleep. 

They gave me the therapy I needed to overcome my issues. 

And I'm a changed man. 

So to wrap this up: 
-There's no magical Jesus pill that fixes everything, whether you believe or not and,
-You're a fucking asshole for chastising someone for not believing hard enough when they're reaching out to a community to discuss their anxiety problems. **Fuck you**, you fucking armchair, lazy ass, computer screen preacher. You're a vile, disgusting person clouded by your delusions.

"Saying ""your wrong"" isn't a very solid argument.

Do you always do what you're told?

Do you ever question authority?

Seems like you just follow a book written by men you don't know out of pure fear. The fear that when you die you stop existing.

Humans have always made up ""gods"" to fill the gaps in our knowledge. It's human nature. Just look at the greek gods for example. They couldn't explain lightning so it must be from a god right? 

When we can't explain something, we make something up to fill the gap. We don't know what happens after you die, so we made heaven up. It puts us at ease before death and keeps society in line by giving a strict moral code. 

And just the notion of not existing is unfathomable to the human mind. I like to think of not existing as the time before you were born, just blank absolute nothingness, nonexistence. The only thing that keeps us here is our consciousness, which will decompose here on earth like everything else.

> I'm going to add something else to this, and that is I saw on the news a prison for kids under 18. Juvie hall. Those kids get sentenced like adults sometimes. I'd rather see them in a theme park.

And I can totally understand that there are some kids where this is an appropriate housing. This facilities do tend to include a range of therapeutic approaches, but there is no magic wand here. Some kids genuinely are too dangerous to keep in a home environment - they need robust physical facilities, and acess to a range of staff. I happen to do quite a bit of stuff in the SEN/EHCP arena in the UK, and in many cases the ideal is to have enough staff so that when something ""kicks off"" you can provide 2:1 **and** rotate the staff every 20-40 minutes so that they are fresh enough to provide the right reactions.

However, Orthodox do not feel the same way at all.

In a perfect world where all the other differences didn't exist, I still could never see the Orthodox submitting to the authority of the Pope. In fact, around the 13th Century or so, the Ottoman Empire was about to sack Constantinople, so they sent word to Rome asking for help. The Emperor agreed, under the condition that they submit to the Pope and become Catholics. Believe it or not, all the Orthodox bishops agreed to this because they knew it was either that or being slaughtered by Muslims. But in Orthodoxy, a decision is only valid if the laity accept it, and they did not. And so Rome refused help, and Constantinople became Istanbul which it remains to this day.",Christianity,0

"I remember watching a documentary a few years ago. It was about people in poor countries who had the worst diseases. Let me tell you, this documentary censored nothing. One man had a huge ballsack because of a cancer, another had his whole ass eaten away by maggots when his family left him to die on the street. This all happened in a third world country, and I feel like God is far more present there.

So this pastor prayed for these people. A woman spat out her breast cancer, the man without an ass started healing, the man with the large ballsack busted open and it all came out. I'm telling you, I've seen some fake healings on youtube and none of them came close to the reality of this. About 2-4 weeks later, they were all told to appear in front of a room filled with medical experts, and none of them could explain how any of that healed completely.

Another more closer to home experience was that of my best friend of the time. He was at a sleepover at our friends' house and they conjured spirits. My best friend was the most rational skeptic I knew, and he woke up in the middle of the night. He ended up running halfnaked into the street. He ran towards his grandmother's house and she actually slapped him because she thought he was calling her a witch. In truth, he claimed that he was being chased by witches, and he claimed that while he was with his grandmother, those witches would just keep looking through the window the entire night. I just wonder how much conviction someone needs to get up and flee the house of another person in the middle of the night.

Another time was with either this same best friend, or another one of my friends. We were talking and stopped dead in our tracks because there was something sitting in the tree in front of my house. It felt like time stood still for a while, and the bright red creature smiled in a very evil way before completely disappearing. I had no idea how long I had been starting at it, and it felt out of this world. I was just about to ask my friend is he had seen that, but he beat me to it and asked ""did you see that?""

"It's not even a special merit though, it's almost a punishment.

I like to give my kids stuff, but it saddens me to think that they might love me just because it gets them gifts. I want them to know that I love them for who they are, and I hope that they love me just because I am Daddy.

Today, marriage is polluted more by this insane expectation that it's going to be like a romantic comedy the whole time, that it's never going to be hard, that... if it's work... then it's time to quit.

I mean, first of all, don't even get married if you're not sure.   Then, try to do what you can to grow and change with your partner and compromise.   Try communicating in a soft tone... try changing the way you approach a subject, etc.

But 66%+ of divorces today are filed by women.  Supposing that even half of those divorces are totally justified, that leaves millions of women walking away for less than good reasons.

The long term damage to kids is under-rated too.

The site I used to post on closed down.  It was mostly women who went on for validation.  The husbands didn't even know their marriage was in trouble in many cases, nor would have been smart enough to ask for help if they did know.

But these women would share a one sided story, essentially looking for some # of responses by which they could feel validated to break up their family.   Once enough people told them... 

""Be strong, you deserve to be happy.  If you're not happy, walk away.  He sounds like a --------!""  

Then they'd get a divorce.

I'd say things like... 

- You've had months to think about leaving your marriage.  You've been stewing on it.  Is it a surprise that he's reacting less well than you'd expect, having just heard this news?   Stay calm, and give him some time to catch up to you, before you make final judgment.


- A guy will do better if he feels you believe in him.   If you don't push him, but just trust him to do better, and he senses that... he'll want to run through walls for you. 


- Before you give up without attempting a reasonable amount of counseling... consider this image.   Picture your children, in the back seat of the car, bawling, with snot running out of their nose, begging you not to do it.   (assuming they had younger kids)   Because, you WILL see that, and it'll break your heart.  And you can't unsee that.   Now is your chance... if you really haven't made your best effort to restore a healthy relationship, actually make that effort.


- You've been together for 5 years  or 10 years...   would it be so bad to spend 3-5 months working on restoring a healthy relationship?  What is the rush to end things?   What if you're wrong?


I'd tell believers this one... 

- You believe that a being exists who is bigger than thousands of billions of galaxies filled with billions of solar systems like ours... and you believe you made a promise before such a being, and that your marriage was blessed by such a being, and this being rewards you for being faithful... and you're not taking that promise seriously?   You either don't really believe, or, you haven't considered what I just said.


Obviously the responses would be tailored to whatever the individual situation was.   In cases of violence or chronic cheating or drug use... protecting the spouse matters first.

But yeah, it's sick that ""quitting on a promise"" is now considered a strength.

I feel very lucky to have found a wife who, I trust, shares those same views.   I could be wrong, but, based on the evidence I've seen of her character, I've got faith in her.


By the way, what I meant by... ""what if it does depend on you?""  was in reference to how you can't count on intervention from God.

You do have faith that God strengthens you, and that's great, but, it's faith, not proof.

It was the simplest law that could be asked for, yet he failed to follow it.

I think part of it is that he had not learned to trust God, he had not learned the absolute necessity of it. When we are saved, we learn to have faith in God's word. To believe what He says.

"[Ashkenazic Jews banned polygamy around the year 1000](http://mi.yodeya.com/a/11042/581), while Shepardic Jews have never banned it.

However, well before the ban (indeed, well before the diaspora, back when Jews were still one community), [polygamy was vanishingly rare](http://mi.yodeya.com/a/69112/581). There are laws which account for it, but all the tales of Rabbis never mention one with more than one wife.

Jews also strive to follow secular law, which insists on monogamy in most countries, so even without a religious ban on polygamy in Shepardic Judaism, polygamous Jews are vanishingly rare these days.

I’m not too worried about that scenario in my denomination as the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod (LCMS) rightly avoids and discourages political activism within the Church setting primarily because of its strict understanding of the distinction between the [Two Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_kingdoms_doctrine). 


The LCMS doesn’t distribute voters’ lists, doesn’t have a Washington office and we are studiously non-partisan (and often criticized for it.) We believe the Church should focus on preaching and teaching Jesus Christ. This creates good Christians, who in turn are good American citizens, who are at liberty to vote however they determine *using their own minds and their own conscience*.

"My thesis is about trying to sketch how between Kant and Hegel--these turn out to be quite natural endpoints--there develops for more or less the first time a properly philosophical approach to the history of philosophy. So, in the 18th century people were already doing history of philosophy, with the big names being Brucker and Meiners. But it was mostly seen, as far as I can tell, as having at most a didactic or even morally edifying purpose. There was no intrinsic philosophical interest. The main obstacle seems to be that history is empirical, and there are no universal truths in it, qua history. So there is then nothing for philosophy to do here, insofar as philosophy is concerned with such universal truths.

Now the way Kant's metaphysics works--you know this, of course--is by being not just another metaphysical system, but by trying to figure out the grounds for doing metaphysics at all. And this is what happens at in the pages on the History of Pure Reason, in relation to history: he gives, roughly, the grounds for the various possible metaphysical systems and this makes it possible for the history of philosophy to be not just an empirical accounting of things people thought, but an account of something intrinsic to philosophy, or human philosophizing, which makes it philosophically interesting.  
He does this a bit more explicitly in his posthumously published response to the prize question asked by the Berlin Academy on what the progress was in metaphysics in Germany since Leibniz and Wolff. Kant's answer is, essentially, ""me,"" but he goes into more detail on how we can speak of progress there. And here you see that Kant's answer is double: on the one hand you have the critique of pure reason (as a project, not the book per se) giving the grounds for judging and understanding all metaphysics, and on the other hand you have the critique appearing in a sort of crude dialectic in the order dogmaticism - skepticism - critique. This dialectic, I suspect, follows for Kant, in analogy to his idea of moral progress, from a self-discipline of reason. So that's the whole Doctrine of Method made relevant.

Kantians pick up on this and start arguing specifically on the historiography of philosophy, beginning with Reinhold. And then, as German Idealism develops, through the Romantics, notions of organicity, of 'philosophy' as some original germ that is expressed and developed through the insight of especially original philosophers develop. And in tandem with an increased interest in hermeneutics, with the relation of philosophy to the time it was written, and all that sort of stuff. And that get's sort of wrapped all up in the figure of Hegel. So that's supposed to be my thesis.",Christianity,0

"&gt;I would disagree. I mean, there are ideas about things that don't exist, but those things aren't real; they're imaginary.

I'm afraid I don't understand the sort of ontology you're working with here.  if God didn't make things that would become evil, those things would be imaginary, wouldn't they?  There is clearly a finite set of ""things that exist"", and an essentially infinite set of ""things that do not exist""; what is creation if not moving things from the latter category to the former?  Are all the things that exist all the things that could exist?  Could god not make other things, or have avoided making the things that are?

&gt;Quite right; God makes his son to shine on the righteous and the unrighteous and makes rain to fall on the just and the unjust. But ""it is in god's nature to bring into existence things that will be evil"" is a far cry for ""god creates evil,"" or even from ""god creates evil things.""

I don't believe I would agree.  By definition, if god created everything then god created all evil things.  It doesn't really matter when they become evil since god knew they would.

"It's good that you have admitted that weed and cigarettes are your God. You have acknowledged your sin of worshiping an idol. Already, you can tell that what you are doing is wrong. 

If you want to be saved, turn to Jesus. Put your trust in him to save your soul. It is only through faith in Jesus that we may be saved. 

Jesus said himself ""Those who walk in the darkness don't know where they are going."" Those without the light of Jesus are lost to sin and stumble in their darkness. But having faith in Jesus (which leads to the Holy Spirit coming to live inside you) will show you the right path in life. You already have enough light to see your wrongdoing of idolatry. Having this light will let you see which choices are right and which choices are wrong, so you won't stumble. 

You'll stumble a little here and there by sinning, but at least you'll know that you're ultimately on the right path - following Jesus as his servant. You won't be like people without Jesus who do not know where they are going and do nothing but stumble. 

Now of course, remember that you can not save your own soul. You can only save it by trusting in Jesus to save it. But, people who are saved in Jesus will (because of the Holy Spirit in them) naturally be able to follow God's rules and live their life conforming to God's will. It's not by following the rules that we are saved, but people who are saved by faith will naturally try to follow the rules. And these people don't have to worry about their lives. Jesus said that we don't have to worry about food to eat or clothes to wear, for God will provide them to us (if we have faith).

Since we who are saved try to follow the rules, we will be living life in the light. We don't have to worry about doing the wrong thing.

&gt;The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.
This thought is also stated by Jesus in Matthew 25:41:

&gt;“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
That he has his own angels, is a further clue to him being a (former) angel. (And incidentally, Isaiah 14:12-15 is often used to show why Satan fell, because he wanted to ascend to God's throne).

&gt;Conclusion: we know that Satan lives / has lived in heaven, with other angels (some of which are his own), that he was (or will be) cast out of heaven. From this we infer that he is a ""fallen angel"".

Sigh. You realize that was an analogy, right? Here's a better one: people who have had chemotherapy, tumors excised, or radiation therapy have higher mortality rates than the general population after treatment. Therefore, all cancer treatment is highly suspect.

The *point* is, when you're comparing mortality rates, the most important metric is comparing the pre-treatment and post-treatment groups, not the experimental group and the general population.

"Humans are basically sponges.  We want to be filled to the saturation point, and we long for that as long as we don't have have it.  In the fallen natural world outside of God, people try to saturate themselves with things other than God - pleasures, achievements, recognition, etc.  None of these things are what we were designed to be saturated with.

But - many of the people who echo Blaise Pascal's assertion that we  have a God shaped hole in our hearts that nothing else can fill, don't evince any sign that they themselves are filled with anything else.  They don't seem to ever have joy unspeakable and full of glory.  Most Christians look much like non-Christians in that their emotions are largely determined by circumstances.

When Christians never evince any other joy than that which circumstances provide, we are actually sending a message to the world that it is circumstances that really matter - job, friends, marriage, health, wealth.  God becomes irrelevant except as a means to attain those things - the things that really matter.

There is one group of believers that DO seem to have had at least a taste of joy unspeakable and full of glory - not in circumstances but in God himself.  They are the mystics.  The mystics were marked overwhelmingly as people who actually carried out God's command to pray without ceasing, and the outcome of their devotion to prayer was that they increasingly attained fulfillment and joy by enjoying the presence of God.

To enjoy God's presence is to know a life giving pleasure that nothing else in all creation can replicate.  That the knowledge and lasting fragrance of this joy is largely absent from the contemporary body of Christ is an indictment against us.",Christianity,0

"""Sin no more"" may not be a command, so much as a promise. 'As long as you repent, my judgement will be forgiveness'. A covenant. How many times did the Father call Israel to sin no more, but was faithful to forgive again?

Same-sex relations are clearly condemned as sinful unnatural activities throughout the OT &amp; NT, and the recent modernist attempts to reinterpret these verses in order to justify the sinful desires of the flesh fail horribly.

Anyone who looks first to the desires of the flesh and second to the Word of God is following only one path - that of damnation, of an eternity separated from God, the path which leads to the hellfire.

How bad do you want to be a Witness for Christ? It's up to all of us whether we choose the temptations of the flesh, or the Word of God.

For the record I have nothing against LGBTQi people, God loves all of His creations, we are all sinners, we all have sins and temptations that are more difficult for us to resist.

"As I see it, determinism is only a meaningful concept if you have the concept of ""before"" and ""after"", really. Surely if God now is the same as God *then* - if God sits as much outside of time as you sit outside the plane of your floor - then it makes no sense to talk about God learning new things (i.e. how an individual human will act) as time goes on. He already knows all there is to know, he can't learn new things, and he's the same now as he was a hundred million years ago.

Free will then means you can pick whatever you like. God's timeless nature and omniscience - the fact that there's no difference between God's knowledge today and tomorrow - means he knows what you'll pick and all the consequences of it.

As for why he then creates people, I've no idea.

I suppose it sort of makes sense, though. I am not anywhere close to omniscient but I know some of my friends somewhat well. I know what they'll pick if I offer them a choice between two things while a strange wouldn't know. That, of course, doesn't detract from their free will.

Ironically, your logic falls short. If logic leads you to the conclusion that everyone is equal, then it's the most *logical* position, not the default one.

&gt;When you use logic to eliminate your biases, you return to the default.

My position is that the default position *is* biased. If we use logic to eliminate our biases, then we have eliminated our ""default"" position, precisely because it is biased. Having said that, I now realize that I don't actually agree with:
&gt;When you use logic to eliminate your biases, you return to the default.


Here's the thing. What you are calling the ""default"" state, more or less refers to the widely accepted cultural norms of the society that a child is born into. It becomes the most ingrained worldview that a person has, their ""default"" worldview, if you will. But still, it is not inherent. It is learned. And this is the point that /u/barwhack was trying to make. 

EDIT: actually, that wasn't the point he was trying to make. This is a direct quote from him:
&gt;Just keep in mind that I was illustrating the absurdity of relativism by pushing it. There is a default biased view, AND a seeming logical view, but I assert &lt;em&gt;an objective view&lt;/em&gt; that is likely neither: God's view; which we can know if He tells us. 

/EDIT

The culture that the muslim man in OP's post was born into is one in which the ""default worldview"" is one where a man's honor is worth more than a woman's life. Now, I don't know if that particular example is actually true, but the point is that there is no inherent ""default worldview,"" and that anything we can consider to be default is in fact learned, and is inherently biased.

"This is the best answer that I know of. You don't have to be okay, calm or strong. Sometimes you won't be, and that's all right. Let yourself feel your emotions or else you'll have an even bigger problem later on. 

I lost two of my best friends within five months of each other when I was 19. It was horrible. I tried to just ""be strong"" and not react, but it just led to repressed feelings (and substance abuse, to be fully honest).

God have you the capability of having feelings. He made you able to be angry, sad and hurt. It's okay to be human.",Christianity,0
"One thing I noticed in Genesis is all three of the ladies who started the line of Israel where barren until God acted and allowed them to have children through his super natural power.  Mary too had to have God to act to have her bear a child.

Also notice Abraham who God asked to sacrifice his only son who was dear to him.  God had to sacrifice his som Jesus to redeem mankind from sin and evil.  Judaism and Christianity are very much against human sacrifice, those were one of a kind events.  And when people did it when God was not involved, he was angry at those who did it.",Christianity,0

"God is just in the same way that the Cretans were liars; he practices justice and does so beyond compare. However, God's mercy ultimately triumphs over justice, as it suits the Lord. This is how it can be the case that love, in 1 Corinthians ch. 13, never delights in injustice, yet also can forget wrongdoing. The primacy of purposes [untangles the puzzle](https://stanrock.net/2016/04/22/but-he-is-also-just/).

St. Isaac understood this:

* ""At the same time these opinions will teach us about the nature of his chastisements and punishments, whether here or there, instructing us concerning what sort of compassionate intentions and purposes he has in allowing these to come upon us, what are the excellent outcomes resulting from them, how it is not the matter of our being destroyed by them or enduring the same for eternity, how he allows them to come in a fatherly way, and not vengefully — which would be a sign of hatred. Their purpose was that, by thinking in this way, we might come to know about God, and wonder at him would draw us to love him, and as a result of that love we might feel ashamed at ourselves and set aright the conduct of our lives here.""",Christianity,0

Yes, a little. :)

...but you do have a point. That's why I did not stressed the ""work hard"" but the ""synergy"" - this makes the difference.

As an aside, there are NO atheists - any human being have a 'god' - in this case 'working hard'. The aspiration to God (eternal perfection) is built inside us from creation.",Christianity,0
"I don't take the Bible literally, just to warn you. 


Do not take this explanation literally! 

Imagined that God has a giant thing of clay. God uses this clay to create a lot of things, rocks, mountains, water, etc. Let's just focus on life. God, at first, takes a tiny peace of clay and gives it life. When the clay multiplies, God slowly changes each living thing to suit it for the different environments, these changes are gradual, but they start becoming plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, etc. They grow more complex. When he finally gets to humans, he gives them a soul, being in his image. 

Creation took a lot longer than 6 days. 6 million years? The creation of plants and animals was a slow process and a lot of changing for a long time. (God is still making adjustments.) My defense? I don't take the Bible literally, and if creation was as simple as it seemed like in the Bible, why wasn't this accomplished in less than a day, and why did God need to rest? If I could say ""Let there be ___"" and it would appear the way I want it, I could easily create a lot of things in under a day. An entire universe if I wished. Why would God, who is infinitely more powerful than I, have to take a break and do one at a time? That's why I don't think creation was as easy as it sounds in the Bible. I think God put a lot of word in creating us, even making adjustments slowly. (Evolution.) ",Christianity,0

If the source of morality is Taught Culture? then disparate teaching *DOES* mean different basic morals. Under such a rubric, when there is no common culture, there is no common basis to judge or ""view [morals] as immoral"".

Understand: I'm using this as an *ad absurdum* argument, to show that eternal grounding is better and Right.

"You're looking at it from the wrong angle imo.

It's about who the speaker, right here today, is talking about.

It's simply a case of definitions basically.

For example, a Christian can ask whether I believe in Jesus, I would answer yes and to him that could mean I'm a Christian. Because to him Jesus rose from the dead and all that.

We're obviously talking about something else. It's about making that difference basically.

So it's not exactly the same person as much as understanding what person WE are talking about.
