I take full responsibility for what I did, there are no excuses for my actions. I was in a bad place, wrong time sort of shit and I wanted to blow some steam so I decided to shoot. I bring my golden everywhere, motherfucker, so I obviously brought him out and tied him to the try. Do you fucking think I would purposefully shoot him in the eye because I'm pissed? No, cunt.

yes, and it can happen at any time, such as just after smoking a joint, does that mean the joint caused it though? No, since you're pre-disposed to it.

Many moons ago I lived in the country and spent hours roaming around the hills and creeks and never came across anything too dangerous, however literally just across from my house was a wooded area that for whatever reason I never went to, I suppose it was too close to be interesting.

However one day I must've thought fuck it or chased something in there or whatever, and I ended up pulling bark off a tree. Now this is never a good idea, no matter how old you are or what country you're from, and I quickly figured out why. It was a large tree and the bark came off one side in one juicy chunk, revealing . . . I didn't know what I was looking at. I was expecting wood or centipedes or a few webs, but it took my eyes a moment to comprehend a seething mass of huntsman spiders, so much so that you could not see the wood until they scattered effing everywhere. I'm not scared of spiders but I've never moved so quick. I wish I had of recorded it or something. It was straight out of a horror movie. Didn't know something that creepy could exist so close to my bedroom, and all worries about aliens in the creek were promptly forgotten.

* **Always** cooperate with the criminal, just don't volunteer help

* **Never** confront the criminal with any threat of violence or show of weapons (this is why almost all banks prohibit their guards from carrying a firearm)

* Attempt to get the criminal away from innocent people as quickly as possible -- get them what they need, and get them out

So while a teller pulling an alarm at your robbery comment seems plausible, the following things about your story do not:

1. Security officer points a gun at you and tells you not to move. If that happened, this is the stupidest bank and the most poorly-trained security officer ever (hint: you don't draw and point your weapon at someone before you give them a command)

2. ""Locking down"" the bank with other customers inside. They're not going to take the risk that you're armed and dangerous and in the mood to take a hostage

3. 15 minute police response. It's _possible_, but pretty unlikely for a police response to take this long for a robbery in progress call

4. After all that, you were released after 30 minutes of police interaction... that would be the most mellow police department ever. Not impossible, I suppose, but pretty unlikely.

If you're in a place that's rural enough for cops to be that mellow and take that long to respond to this kind of call, this incident would certainly make the news. Show us proof, OP, or /r/quityourbullshit ",tifu,1

"LPT: Don't text the person you want to murder that you're outside and are going to try to murder them. 

Pick the lock that is in a secluded part of the house, preferably garage or joined fixture. If not possible, go into the door furthest from the place the person would be.

Then, once the door is open, cut the lines. If there is power before you break the locks, there is a higher chance of something electronic that makes noise masking the sound of you messing with the lock.

Hide. Not in a corner, you should have scouted before hand. Be in a place there wouldn't be: Flashlights, batteries, breaker box, kitchen, bathroom, etc. No high traffic places and no place they would try to turn power back on.

Wait a few hours, to make sure theyd be asleep. Unlock the front door just in case, the front is generally closer, and would aid in escape if something happens.

While they're asleep, silently creep into their room and take their phone and any nearby weapons. Dispose of these. If they can't call or defend thenselves, they are at your 'mercy.'

If they're home alone and asleep, chokeholds or strangling until unconscious is a good method. Once they are unconscious, do what you like. Keep an eye on then stirring back to consciousness though, if they wake up and you don't notice before they come to, it will be harder and neighbors may be alerted.

"> UPDATE Finally talked to the Colonel and the Major. Very short meeting but felt like forever. Yeah I got in some serious trouble. Getting a counseling statement

This is a good thing.  Go with it.  My understanding is they're not always ""great"" on emotional stuff.  You seem ""over"" it - so you should be good here.  Just get back in gear.  Listen to what they say and answer questions but don't obviously open yourself up to anything u dont want ;-)




> and the Colonel said, ""Good luck with promotions"".

Yeah yeah.  This rotation.  Do your BEST the rest of this time and by the end of next rotation you'll be in line again :)  If your career was over, you wouldn't be there still.



> A lot of yelling and even my Major took a lot of the blame for not double checking.

As he should have.  Now this guy and you are going to have to patch stuff up.  He's your commander.  You know this stuff already but man up to him, admit it, and *THANK* him for speaking up for you.

Bro code and all.  He did well here - I've heard on other forums of others in similar positions essentially being slimy and passing the buck.  You got a good major there I think.

> Got a pretty bad verbal or written reprimand... I pretty much apologized throughout the meeting, admitted to my mistake and left the office.

This is the official stuff.  You got a warning.  It was deserved, in a way, but that's the official stuff out the way.  A warning.  Learn.  next time you're over-whelmed, don't let it get to this point.  Speak up.  

> I just don't know why he made me sit in this office for two hours before showing up but I didn't dare to ask.

to make you sweat, and to make you think about it.  To make you get like this - self conscious and sorry for yourself.

He's a good commander.  It made you think and ask for advice - and you are taking the advice.  Which shows he has some faith or trust still in you and you still have it in you to do good by him.

:)

"For those who just got here; the oddly removed post:

Long story short, I gained over 10lb from Thanksgiving and I decided to hit the gym every day since then. Seeing how fat I was made me really sad so I've been doing tons of cardio and legs for the past few days. Last night, my friend and I decided to run around 4 miles on the treadmill and do some INSANE swole leg workouts (never skip a leg day). Big mistake. My legs felt like jelly and I couldn't walk.. For some reason, the gym that I go to has an escalator inside the building. Anyways, the freaking escalators were turned off and I was like oh hell nawww, I ain't walking up that. This is where the FU happened..
Without even thinking and looking whether if anyone was walking up or down the escalators, I saw the on and off button and decided to turn the on button. The moment I did that, I heard a scream and couple of people falling including my friend who fell forward cause the escalator started moving up. This woman got a pretty bad cut from moving and my friend fell forward landing right on this forehead. He had to get around 14 stitches last night.. I've been officially kicked out of the gym for good and my friend hates me. He called me a lazy f***boy this morning and he's really salty. Time to eat my life away, stay fat and cry. The second closest gym is 34 mins from my house.

TL;DR: Didn't want to walk up the escalators that was turned off, decided to turn it on causing a random stranger and my friend to fall forward with injuries.",tifu,1

"Leaving the letter wasn't your fuck up. Being a shitty employee who had no interest in actually working with your managers and co-workers as a team was. If what you yourself have stated here is true? No Judge is going to rule on your behalf. I'm going to guess you are under the age of 35 and most likely have an idealistic version of what the perfect workplace should be, firmly imbedded in that millennial brain of yours. I bet you earned alot of participation trophies as a kid. 

If I'm wrong? You may want to consider seeking professional mental help. Work is hard. It's not fun and all of us have a boss to bow down to. Get over yourself, cut your losses and stop looking for excuses to not find another job. Engineer jobs are everywhere. Accept YOUR mistake and move on to bigger and better things. LEARN FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE. It doesn't matter where you go or what you decide to do. Bosses suck. EVERYWHERE AND ALL THE TIME. IT'S THEIR JOB TO BE AWFUL AND ANNOYING. Even the ""cool"" bosses. 

One more thing? NEVER QUIT. Want that free ride? Keep your frustration to yourself and let a company fire you. We live we learn. It's time to move on kid, you fucked yourself and no you're not going to see any of that sweet sweet unemployment this time around. Better keep sending out those resumes and hope no one wants to contact your previous employer. BE HONEST ABOUT THIS IF YOU GET AN INTERVIEW. They will have already checked, or will shortly after. Don't fuck yourself further by lying or stretching circumstance.

>(I tried posting this last night but it was removed for me not being clear enough about how this negatively impacted me; reposting with more details.)

>This actually happened almost twenty years ago. This was back when Kia sold cars only in the Pacific northwest. I had a 1994 Kia Sephia to sell. However, I had moved from Oregon to Louisiana for my job, and in Louisiana the make and model were essentially unknown. I placed a classified ad in the local newspaper, over the phone, and it ended up saying ""Akia"" rather than ""Kia"" (I probably told them I had ""a Kia"" to sell).

>I had no idea at the time, but ""Akia"" apparently is code for ""A Klansman I Am"".

>The people who responded to the ad at first seemed excited, and several asked weird things like ""Are you the one selling an Ayak?"" to which I would reply ""A what? No, I'm selling a Kia Sephia"" I learned years later my answer was essentially exactly how a Klansman was supposed to respond, in a call-and-response code (""Ayak"" apparently being code for ""Are you a Klansman?"").

>The calls would go one of two ways. The caller would either become upset and angry at me when (they thought) we got past the ""code"" but I'd then ""refuse"" to tell then what kind of car I was selling, with me repeating ""It's a Kia Sephia"" and them asking, ""Is it a Toyota, or what?"" and me saying over and over ""No, it's a Kia!"" Or the callers would assume I was never selling a car in the first place and I had just placed the ad trying to make contacts, so they'd keep talking to me about things other than the car. I fielded a full week of angry, hateful phone calls like that, even after I'd sold the car, which didn't seem to matter to most of the callers.

>I ended up selling car to a big, scary guy who kept talking about ""the damn [n-word]s"". I tried to just talk about the car, but I was scared shitless the whole time as he went on and on. I'm pretty sure the only reason he came out to look the car at all was entirely because of my use of inadvertent KKK codewords in the ad.

>It was of the most frightening weeks of my life, and at the time I had no idea why. As a naïve guy from Portland, I just assumed this was what Louisiana was like. This happening within a few weeks of me moving there, it set the tone for my time there and was a big part of why I quickly started looking for a new job as far away from Louisiana as I could (one of which I ended up taking with a not-insignificant pay cut).

One of the things that defines a detention vs arrest is that the police can only detain you for a brief period to investigate, and must use the least intrusive means available to investigate.

Two minutes later he comes into the laundry place to pick up his DRY CLEANING. WTF? Yep, didn't waste his time loading machines and swapping laundry had the place do it for him.

"I did something ballsy last time this happened to me. I rolled up to a gas station one day and this guy in a white sports car walks up to me and tells me that he's trying to get to some party a couple hours away but his debit card has been declined and he's all out gas. So I go, okay just give me a minute while I get change from inside the gas station and I'll help you out. I go inside and tell one of the gas clerks that there is a man outside bugging people for money. The clerk kind of just nods and goes about his regular business, organizing a few items on the shelf and what not. So I walk out gather up the courage to confront this guy. First question I ask him if his car is completely out of gas, he says yeah. I go inside his car to turn the key and it's 3/4 full. I tell him, well it says it's almost full, how about we try turning it on. Like magic the  vehicle turns on!  Well I guess you don't need any further assistance from here. He gives me a quick glance says thanks and moves his car to a different spot in the gas station and tries to hustle another guy, but seeing as he just moved his car, the guy tells him no lol. The guy in the white sports car then drives up to me, flicks me off and drives off so ferociously, he almost side swipes incoming cars coming towards the gas station.

"Here's how tardies work at my school:

If you're late to class by even a few seconds, and it's before lunchtime that day, you get lunch detention in the ISS room. Even if you show up to class before the bell rings and ask to go to the bathroom, so they clearly know where you are, and you're only a few seconds late (like, the amount of time it took to tell them where you were going), you get lunch detention.

If you wait for class to start, though, you can ask to go to the bathroom and most teachers will let you go. So you can take an entire bathroom break's worth of time out of class and be just fine, but if you take a few seconds of the very beginning of class, nope, lunch detention.

The best part is that as a senior, they let you leave campus for lunch, meaning I don't bring a lunch, or lunch money. They'll let you get lunch without paying and pay later, but still- if I'm ever late to class by a few seconds I'll be paying the school for my lunch, and by extension, for my tardiness.

They don't give you any breaks if you've never been late before, anymore, either. This policy, then, has resulted in some people missing their first class of the day altogether when they know they're going to be late, in order to show up to *school* late, to avoid punishment.

I don't understand. I haven't been late in a few years now, and I still hate this policy. 

Edit: The policy started this year- I meant to convey that the policy doesn't really affect me, not that it has been effective. Just realized that I could have been interpreted that way.",tifu,0

They didn't announce the votes but my class had about 120 people in it and most of the class was in on the joke so I'm assuming I probably had 100+ votes.,tifu,0

"I had something similar-ish happen once. Was downtown in Columbus, OH, headed to the phone store to get mine fixed. Had a guy, pretty obviously a bum, come up asking for bus fare. He said he was trying to get his life back on track, recently had gotten a job offer, but didn't have any way to get there because he was still broke. He did have a new ID, which he showed me to try and back up his story, and was surprisingly well-spoken and polite for someone who looked like he should be half-drunk, half asleep, under some newspapers in an alley. I ended up going with him to a nearby Kroger and getting him a 20. The way I see it, if he was truly trying to turn his life around, then I'm happy I could help with that in some small way -- and if he was just going to turn around and spend it on booze or drugs, then there wasn't much I (a 21-year-old student at the time) was going to be able to say to turn him from that path.",tifu,0

"Best $20 I ever spent was the first time I went into a casino and stuck my hard-earned bucks (at $5.25/hr -taxes back then) into a slot machine.  I pulled the lever four times and my money was gone.  Poof!

I haven't gambled since then.  It was a valuable learning experience.",tifu,0
Actually pretty smart. I never thought about that.,tifu,0
