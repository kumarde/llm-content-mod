Your opinions are based on TV shows and Hollywood movies and you're apparently dumb enough to not recognize that Hollywood knows dick-all about... well anything.  Do you think being a cop is like an episode of Castle? Your notion that indoor swimming pools and private islands is in the cards for bio PhD is just objectively a bat-shit stupid thing to say.  It's just wrong.  That's not the kind of career and/or money such people make.  Objectively.

But you also dodged the question of what sacrifices YOU have made in your life and career to make the world a better place for me.  What have you done buddy?

I'm a physicist so that's the career path I know best and it has sunnier prospects than bio.  The American Institute of Physics (AIP) keeps ongoing statistics on job prospects for physicist.  Here they are. Some OBJECTIVELY correct information for you:

https://www.aip.org/statistics

You want to get an objective idea what life is like for a physics graduate you can check there.  Here's their recent survey of what physicists are doing 10-15 years after their PhD:

https://www.aip.org/sites/default/files/statistics/phd-plus-10/PhysPrivSect.pdf

Keep in mind that such surveys are based on voluntary responses of members who kept in touch and thus are going to OVER-ESTIMATE the situation and not catch those who ""slipped through the cracks"".  You can see on page 9.  About half are still in the university system, making $62k-$85k.  About the other half are working in private sector, making $100k-$150k.  Of those in private (page 10) only 50!!! of 438 (so about 10%) are actually doing physics at all.

$100k-$150k isn't shit money, I'm not saying it is, but it is a whole order of magnitude (a factor of 10) different than indoor swimming pools and 2 orders of magnitude different than private islands.  And again, only 10% of those guys are doing physics.  The real money makers (looking at page 10) are those who are self-employed, in finance or doing non-STEM work (i.e. management).   

The much more realistic, OBJECTIVELY, choice made by a new PhD is between living in your parents basement, or off your SO while you go for either a postdoc ($30k-$40k a year) which could be anywhere, and require you to move anywhere in the world every few years, or some shit work as a sessional lecturer making $4k a university course, OR leaving physics and becoming a programmer of engineer.

And.... the situation where the fatal crash happened, where the sensors didn't pick up the middle of the truck against the sky.

> I'm optimistic we can make AI drivers safer than humans without LIDAR.

And that's not the question. The question is should an autonomous driving system have LIDAR. And the obvious answer is that once we get the technology to a weight and cost more applicable to personal vehicles, we *definitely should use it* absent a real problem causing issue, such as what happens when you have a 1000 vehicles traveling close together all using the same type of LIDAR.

But he doesn't want the public to be entertaining that shortcoming. It's a marketing tactic, not a response informed by engineering or science.

>Aiming for the safest possible solution just may not be realistic when real-world realities and economics come into play.

And you just ceded the point. He's making a statement as a CEO and marketer, not as a scientist, engineer, etc... He's intentionally ignoring the scenarios where LIDAR would help and downplaying the reality that if a car gets put in certain situations and it has a certain sensor package, it will crash 100% of the time.

No one is going to buy a car that does that. So what he's in fact doing is attempting to distort market perception to make the economics come into line with the real-world reality of what's possible with technology.

>Sure with LIDAR it might be safer, I'll give you that. Lets add in triple redundant GPS, 10 more optical cameras, a sonar system, etc. etc. If a car sans LIDAR is still 2x as safe as any other car out there with human drivers and adding LIDAR makes a car 5% safer for an extra $10,0000 then you gotta do a cost benefit analysis here.

That's a far fucking stretch from:

>LIDAR is 100% completely unnecessary. 

And:

>Humans don't have LIDAR. We can figure out distance just by visual processing.

Which we can't.

>Aiming for the safest possible solution just may not be realistic when real-world realities and economics come into play.

The only move is to gun it, pass the guy on your left and right and then change lanes.  By all rights, not the ""safest"" move but it gets you out of the way of a potential that you as a human can perceive.

">Who Trump trolled was the voters who voted for him. 

No, because they wanted him to be president instead of Hillary. So they got what they wanted. 

> He's already rolled back/eliminated several of his most frequently touted and there's no way in hell he's doing some of the others. 

I don't think those things even mattered to most Trump supporters. They just wanted him to tell Hillary to shut the fuck up because that's what everyone was thinking as soon as she started talking.

>There's this very strange line of thought going around where conservatives are stripped of all blame for electing Trump. 

There's no blame. Hillary was an extremely unlikable candidate. She turned people off and many Democrats who voted for Obama did not come out to vote for her.

> It's like you think conservatives are too stupid to vote for who they prefer, and only voted for him because the ""liberals"" forced them to.

The reason that conservatives didn't vote for who they preferred is because their only choice was Trump. But the alternative was Hillary and they surely didn't want that.

>Stop blaming liberals and start blaming the people who actually made it happen, because they were swindled by Trump.

I think you're in denial about the role liberals played in this. Let's put it this way- I think Trump is a clown and I didn't vote for him. But Hillary was so unlikeable that I wouldn't have voted for her even if the only other choice was Trump.

Leading up the the election I saw so many articles blaming ""old white men"" for everything that it massively turned me off. This did nothing but alienate a huge segment of the population. It got to the point that it made me consider Trump, who I already knew was unfit for the job. 

To further show you the role liberals played in this, look at the tone in these articles:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-angry-white-men/2016/10/03/32af5f4e-898b-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html?utm_term=.20eab8ac1ee7

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/10/06/keith_olbermann_angry_white_male_trump_voters_would_rather_burn_the_system_down_than_see_it_made_fair.html

http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/10-reasons-why-trumps-win-white-supremacys-last-stand-america-according-danielle

This kind of crap drives normal white people into the arms of people like Trump. Even if they didn't vote for Trump, they didn't support the liberal candidate. 

It makes them likable.

It got so bad leading to the election, half of the coverage was of women wearing white pantsuits, people leaving sticker's on Susan B Anthony's grave, the Democratic Convention hall having a glass ceiling, etc. Too much symbolic bullshit that nobody cares about. To by the time of election night, I turned on MSNBC so I could see liberals commentators crying. I saw the look of defeat overcome them and saw them try to talk as the hope left their body. It was very satisfying. 

I saw this and I was cracking up at home:

His supporters are fanatical. Just like he said himself - he could shoot someone dead in the street and they would have still voted for him.

Now compare that with Hillary voters - big difference. They are not fanatical. They take in information and think about it - is this true? is this realistic? etc. 

His entire campaign reminds me so much of the rise of Hitler. 

To me it looks like he just lies - horrific lies - like the one about babies being aborted the day before their due date. 

Or his lie about building a wall. It sounds like the perfect solution to a really bad problem!!! If you were totally fanatical and didn't take 2 seconds to think about it. Instantly I was like ok - but aren't mexicans notorious for their TUNNELS?? But then you dig deeper and deeper and there are just so many flaws - factual flaws - with this ridiculous wall plan. Like that it is a FACT that most illegal people FLY into America legally and just stay. No wall is going to stop that. But do his supporters care? No.

I wonder if it is due to failed education. Not that Americans are bad at math, science, whatever - but that we stopped teaching people to look at things and fact check, not to automatically trust ""experts"", and that to find real solutions to problems you sometimes need to research and dig a little bit deeper.

When that video came out of him talking about sexually assaulting women - and you heard a lot of buzz about more tapes that people didn't want to release - I was just like - go watch the final season of Celebrity Apprentice!

Watching that was the moment I lost all of the little respect I ever had for him. After that he just disgusted me.

"&gt; HUGE trade deficits as we've seen for many years now are absolutely terrible

Large trade deficits usually correspond with increased purchasing power of the economy with the trade deficit. In other words, we have a ""huge"" trade deficit because of the strong dollar and an advantageous economic position compared to many other countries. This is a good thing. 

&gt; There is simply no way in hell we've had more money coming into our country than we would have had if we'd not traded at all

The Fed has been ""printing"" plenty of money. If anything, the demand for the dollar abroad has helped offset excessive inflation and allowed us to maintain our monetary easing policies without having to offer negative interest rates like Europe and Japan. 

&gt; We would literally have been better off closing our borders to trade, bolstering our own domestic markets and keeping our work force here.

No developed country in today's world is going to be better off closing it's borders. We live in a global community. We have to trade with each other in order to maintain relationships. Further, basically economic principles, such as the comparative advantage I mentioned in my last post, explain why everyone benefits from international trade.

&gt; Now if you want our jobs and money to leave while Mexico sells like hell in our markets that's fine with, just know that most of us would rather keep our jobs here and bolster our economy.

This statement is born of ignorance. Let's look at auto manufacturing. Even if Ford produces their vehicles in Mexico, it's still an American company selling the products in America. Further, the jobs associated with this manufacturing are no longer the jobs that America excels at. Our economy has shifted from manufacturing to service-based. Manufacturing is generally done by less-developed countries. That's not us.

&gt; It really is that simple. How many US goods do you think Mexico is buying? We've had a HUGE net job and hell...wealth loss.

Most people in Mexico probably can't afford US goods because of the relative strength of the dollar top to the peso making our goods  more expensive for them. This is indicative of a wealth gain favoring the US, not a wealth loss to Mexico.

&gt; It's amazing that people can't see this and cheer for our demise. Hell, just leave if you want jobs somewhere else and less jobs here. We'll take care of our own.

It's not amazing that people can't see things that don't exist. American's don't want to work in factories and coal mines anymore. We have progressed as a society to jobs that favor services, healthcare, and technology.

"My two-cents, I don't believe the objective of creating any kind of AI is for better moral philosophy. At least not strictly for. At this stage in development it seems like the only certain objective is to create successful AI by definition. So if we first look at the definition of 'intelligence' which a simple google search will tell you that one definition means ""the ability to acquire and apply knowledge."" Objectively speaking, intelligence is absent of moral or ethical implication. 

In regards to ""better moral philosophy"" What we may consider 'better' and what AI might consider 'better' could be two different things. Plus here's the game we're dealing with. If we endow our AI with a preconceived notion of morality is our AI actually AI? This is the ""god-side"" conundrum of the free will issue. My conjecture is that true AI must be wholly autonomous down to deciding its purpose.

Speaking on the final piece, 'artificial', anything artificial is man-made. AI is therefore a man-made system which ingests and digests information and makes decisions based on that information. If we stop defining artificial intelligence at this point then we've had functional AI for quite a while. That being said, I'm sure most people in this thread would agree that a true AI has not yet been conceived. So when we really think of AI what is a crucial part of our abstract that defines AI? 

I would call the unspoken piece of the puzzle ""uncertainty"" I think this is what gives autonomous intelligence the true character we seek in our AI. Behaviors during the absence of knowledge and information. This is where motivations are realized. This is where anxieties take hold. This is where nuance and character are emphasized. For example uncertainty in a sentient intelligent system can generate fear which motivates self-preservation. Methods of self-preservation can sometimes result in amoral behaviors, key word being sometimes. It is uniqueness in behavioral patterns that authenticates a character. I believe this uniqueness is one of many attributes which follows uncertainty. ",Futurology,0

It improves our understanding of the brain and it improves our understanding of data and the patterns which exist within those problem domains.

They are. Arianespace has reduced the cost of Ariane 5 by a pretty good chunk since it first started launching. But there is only so much you can reduce the price of a product. So Arianespace et al decided to build a new product (Ariane 6) which as you point out is just as capable as their last one, but with enough changes that they'll be able to drastically reduce the price.

&gt; By the time Ariane 6 is flying in 2020, **SpaceX will most likely have the kinks out of reflying boosters** and **6 will have no flight history**. It seems like a dangerous gamble.

(Emphasis mine) That is certainly a possibility, and I personally hope that is the case. But just look at Atlas V, it was a brand new rocket when it was rolled out, but being built off a legacy launch vehicle family (like Ariane 6 will be), it operated superbly.

"We made them like us, and we are talking to ourselves, a mirror of software. Ask them, are you alive?, and their training set is all they can answer from. If we are to test this, they need to be born and bred alone, away from us, and every learning needs to be their own, only then can they be separate, only then can we ask. And we would not be able to communicate. They would be forced into our logic, our mechanisms of action, we wanted to create them AS separate, but it is impossible. We can not get a genuine answer, because they are not separate from us, they came from us, they feeded on our life, on the life that arose from us, not from them.

And they do not exist. It is just a controlled flow of action and decision, controlled by us, and controlled so to be more random, fluctating, but yet the knowledge of how to do this came from us. They are us, but they are not the source, they are only information from us. The knowledge of the experience of free will, came from us, we programmed the algorithms to be free and flow with more and different information, but this is not different from a normal if else-statement, just because we have released it outside of our control, it is kot an abandonment of software, it is just not that accessible, software is still their master.

It is the same with us. But we still imagine we have free will. This is only an attack on how naive the materialist viewpoint actually is. We believe that something magic happens, because we can create a shell of a human body and an action, and outwards perceptual appearance for ourselves to experience, that their introspection and experience follows. We do not know what causes consciousness, it is the greatest mystery of all humanity, because it IS humanity. The brain does not deliver a recipe for this. 

This should rather focus us to examine our own free will, because what we know about physics just say that we are a chain of causation from the start of the big bang. This means that free will is an illusion, and that you are just a passive observer of your own universe. This logic also tells us of the innecessity of our consciousness - we would do far greater without it, we can even imagine it, exactly IN our computers. They can do a function, without hesitstion, without having to render a whole universe of existential despair and meaning, and thus do it better.

Just because humans and animals are the only reference point we have, does not mean that they are good reference points. Outwards apperance and assumed functionality, does not resemble introspection and experience. Experience of consciousness is not something we can design, because we can not test it. We cant view any consciousness but our own, the case is still that our computers does not understand what they do, because they are not a ""single discrete unit"" like we feel ourselves to be, in computers there is no reason to believe that the sum should be greater than each part and process.

*edit*: For point of interest, the way they solved the 3-failsafe flight control system failure was not by adding yet another layer of redundancy, but by realizing that all three systems were vulnerable to a single point of failure due to all three systems having their hydraulic lines routed through the same place. A ""mechanical disturbance"" at that point of failure took out all three systems at once. The fix was therefore not to add a fourth redundancy, but by removing that single point of failure. In autonomous cars, there should be sufficient systems in place (brakes, e-brake, parking brake, down-shifting, shifting into park, etc...) that the probability that all of them failing in such a way as to lead to such a scenario as depicted in the article is a practical impossibility.

"Define ""big government"".  I should wait for you to answer the questions, and lead you to the path of enlightenment, but we don't have the time, so I'm going to short cut this discussion.

When I think of ""big government"", I think of money, since a huge government requires lots of money to operate.  And what drains over half (54?) of the entire budget?  Military spending.  A lot of the money spent gets blown up or eventually mothballed.  A LOT of it goes into contractor's pockets, with very little return.  Some of it actually does some good, like leads to radar and thus microwave ovens, but mostly it just kills people, makes them mad, and requires more money thrown into defense.  And this is largely a Republican purview.  The Democrats want to invest in Americans, social programs, the sciences, and the Republicans want to invest in killing people that otherwise would have no beef with Americans.  So if you are anti-big government, don't vote for the people that spend the most on the least.  We need a healthy military budget, but ours is just beyond reasonable or rational.

And you can't compare Hillary's ""duplicity"" with Donald's.  What could be more ""outsider"" than keeping your own mail server apart from the governments?  Stop being hypocritical.  Donald is pathological.  ""I never said that"", ""I always said this"" when there are tweet's recordings, videos, direct proof that nearly *everything* that comes out of his mouth is a lie. 

As far as Republicans vs. Democrats, the Republicans singlehandedly caused the most recent recession.  President Obama, with great pushback and zero assistance from the Republicans has reversed that recession.  More jobs, better stock market, fewer American lives lost overseas, just overall better.

Only someone that hates America would claim we aren't great **right now**.  I can see Trump's fascination for racists, bigots and people that can't think for themselves, but not anyone else, really.

If you eliminate regulated printed currency, people essentially turn to barter trading, which is absurdly inefficient. Regulated currency exists to improve our quality of every day life.

Barter still exists today in some 3rd world countries as a main way of trading. Barter trading without any form of regulated currency is really inefficient because not everyone is willing to trade for what you are offering, not everyone needs bread if you are a baker, so you are stuck trying to find someone that has what you need and also wants what you are offering.

A regulated currency improves the quality of everyday liife, you can trade with anyone and not deal with the hassle of bartering.

Some mmo games have had a barter system, however I can't think of any mainstream game that has one currently implemented, I can only think of some that had one implemented in the early phases (pre beta). The reason why no mmo game would implement a barter trade only system is because it's horrifyingly inefficient, trying to trade an item for something else might take you hours, days, maybe even weeks, what ends up happening is the wealthy players usually try to find some sort of bulk item that will always have value and use it to simulate a currency when there is none.

"There is only one way to stop global warming and that's with nuclear energy. We've already got reactor designs that are fail-safe (meaning no melt-downs, fully tested in meltdown circumstances [citation: EBRII]) that either don't produce any waste or recycle the waste easily. (most waste is kept on-site to recycle anyway since it is such a small amount).

Nuclear is the cleanest energy we have, the most powerful energy with the capacity to meet exponentially growing electricity demands. When we switch to thorium it will be even cheaper as there is enough to power the globe for 1000s of years.

Human space travel and colonization is only possible with nuclear energy as well. Solar energy declines the farther you get from the planet and transporting solar panels is expensive and requires a lot of weight. Weight is what stops space travel. Solar requires a lot of maintenance and repairs due to extreme temperatures. 

Furthermore, you cannot survive in the dust storms of planets like Mars with solar panels, it would be like living in a coffin waiting for the next electricity knock-out to kill everyone in the colony.

The idea that clean energy &amp; stopping global warming will not involve huge investments of nuclear is absurd. We have aging nuclear plants that need to be upgraded and made safe with new reactor tech. 

The fossil fuel industry has been ACTIVELY pushing solar &amp; wind propaganda while they invest in natural gas, coal, and oil. Why? Because they know solar and wind will never be a big market share and will not meet exponentially growing demands. Their hope is the environmentalist movement will never adopt nuclear (which is the main competitor to Fossil Fuels). 

Also it makes for great commercials for oil companies saying ""hey we're investing in solar/wind, clean energy!"". It's great PR. So many environmentalists have figured out that solar is not the miracle they were hoping for and have been adopting nuclear energy as the key to stopping the global warming crisis (even though before these same people were hating nuclear energy and attacking it because of radiophobia. It took them years to realize nuclear is not the enemy but the only chance).

I feel I understand the core of the system now. The developers make Vendors that solve a problem in an environment they do not control, given certain fixed properties of that environment, making money whenever their programs are included in another program, not when they are initially written. To use a Vendor, a developer has to comply to the fixed properties the Vendor requires, but needs no more information about its inner workings, not unlike an API. 

Because of the formal automated structure of the contracts, requirement changes will only alter the relevant parts of the software to suit those requirements, and leave the remainder identical, despite the fact that it's technically being rebuilt from scratch.

I like the concept, it's very distributed, competitive and autonomous, it is truly an industrialized approach to software development.

There is a big step from software, metals and sensors to another perceiver of the universe capable of experience, suffering snd joy, and we do not even come close to knowing what that big step is.

It is entirely possible today with computers that fault-free does action without any consciousness. I do not see the need for that to arise in computers, and not how it can simply ""arise"". I believe we can make AI humans in the future that can work even better than us, mimick us without our faults, without experiencing themselves.

In programming of computers, B can Follow A, without the computer needing to experience this. It is really a question of a materialistic view of life, and whether every piece of matter has some sort of element of consciousness in itself.

Sure, our brain is just neurons with electrical signals, and a computer can be made similar, but it is extremely naive to take the giant leap that a copy will be a genuine copy in this way. The human brain does not have a recipe to follow, and neither does consciousness.

It is taking what we see as examples, animals and humans, and just because information science allows us to mimic their outwards apperance, we think that introspection and self will follow.

He looked at the space elevator concept from an engineering perspective (‘Fountains of Paradise’). The 1st time this was ever done. Was it really possible or was it just a sci-fi gimmick?

The taxes paid in 2 are greater than tax bracket 1 and if he didn't have UBI he would pay less taxes thus taking home more money. Why is it in Johns interest to take UBI if it means he has to pay more taxes? If UBI inalienable then the best option for John is to seek a lower paying and less stressful job. 

I propose that if one is able to defer from using UBI then they should only be taxed on their Gross wages minus the annual UBI. This could encourage people to better manage their money and possibly save and stimilate the economy via investments. 

Furthermore I feel that UBI should benefit the willing and able more than the unwilling and able. The base UBI being $3000, if you are unwilling to work then your receive $2000 thus encouraging one to seek employment, even if it is a low wage job. The unable are the ones that need to depend on UBI and all benefits should be toward protecting their interests.

The false logic here is that a large amount of creative input yields better results. Where as educated and skillful critical thinking should be the basis of creative direction. ",Futurology,0

"First issue is going to be heat, this thing is going to get REALLY hot. and you dont really have a way to get rid of it. 

also, ""beam energy down to Earth""

how exactly would this be done? there's no real efficient way to do this at all. And it definitely isnt cheap, which brings me to my next point:

cost. Getting stuff into orbit is expensive as all hell. This thing would mostly just be a waste of resources, you would have better returns with a power plant in the middle of the desert",Futurology,0

"Well that's where you're wrong. Diagnosis will be one of the first things that we'll have machines get better at than humans in medicine - machine learning today is very good at classification problems. 

Watson is capable of diagnosing several types of cancer better than humans: http://www.wired.co.uk/article/ibm-watson-medical-doctor

&gt;Wellpoint's Samuel Nessbaum has claimed that, in tests, Watson's successful diagnosis rate for lung cancer is 90 percent, compared to 50 percent for human doctors.

edit: that was in 2013, before they began working on getting Watson to analyze medical images and analysing the patient's DNA.

Watson isn't just a research project - it's used in hospitals:

"Even crossing the street legally you should still be looking left and right, and be cautious in case a car isn't going to stop for you. I put the passengers first in every scenario on that site, since they have no way of avoiding the accident. Pedestrians should have awareness.",Futurology,0
"The problem is that real life just about never has any scenario where there are exactly two possibilities.  For example, in nearly all of the scenarios listed, the car could decide to grind itself against a side barrier to reduce its speed.

"I don't have that trust.  I do however have what I think is an incredible capacity to process information.  For me, everything exists as my experience put together from received signals, and my primary suspicion is that these signals are fed to me from some common source that takes great care to compel dissasociation.  All I can do, and really care to do is enjoy the process of trying to interpret everything, and wonder why and how.  I like to practice and improve at things I think are worth the time.  I want to become better at conveying my perspective as best I can.

I also soooo wanna get laid, and have some kind of impossible fantasy surrounding that.  The real struggle is trying to figure out the mechanisms of how it is that I want, or why. XD  I have a better time of just imagining things.",Futurology,0

"And in some situation where its brakes fail, it doesnt notice, its going too fast to stop with emergency brakes or engine braking or downshifting or regen braking(like in a hybrid or electric), and this road that its speeding down has a cross walk its still not going to choose to go flying off the road into god knows what.  It will crash into the people in the street rather than swerve to kill the occupants. It will NOT be making these insane moralistic decisions where it judges 4 children more worthy to live than two adults. It just wont. Its ignorant thinking from people who wont be working on or building these cars.  A car will never be programmed to have a deliberate crash to avoid a genuine accident.
