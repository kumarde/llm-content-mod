"It's a shame that this apparently adult woman has retained the speech habits of a younger person. Besides making her sound more immature and less knowledgeable, it also makes her just plain harder to understand. I'm grateful that she avoids upspeak (though it does sound to me like that may have been a recent habit she's still consciously forcing herself to avoid), but she retains other distracting and distorting speech habits that unfortunately diminish the effectiveness of her speech.

Her vocal fry, for example, is out of control; if she doesn't stop that, she'll not only continue to be difficult and distracting and irritating for others to listen to, but she'll soon do permanent damage to her voice.

Maybe more than that, though, is her habit of end-dropping, another very common and very irritating modern speech habit that makes a speaker harder and more frustrating to understand. Tones drop at the ends of words or statements, such that one has to either listen more carefully to catch what's being said, or turn up the volume so that the rest of speech is harsh and loud. Either way, it sucks for the listener, and makes them want to stop listening.

I've long felt that Western society as a whole, and especially American culture, has been getting gradually more immature on average, and by this point that now *regularly* includes the regrettable habit of adults who speak and act like younger people. This includes qualified experts with advanced degrees, who sound like they're still in high school or even *junior* high school. Those habits may not seem to restrict them in their most immediate lives, but it does mean that a great many others who you'll never speak to directly will be more doubtful about your real qualifications, since you don't seem to have adopted the habits of sober and serious adults who should be listened to, even if it's *not* hard to understand what you're saying.

We all know better than to show up at a job interview or a funeral with shitty clothes on. How we convey ourselves in language is the raiment of social discourse beyond the range where we can directly engage others one on one, and we need to choose the language clothing that most inspires respect and confidence in us. I would expect a Yale student to have figured that out by the time they reach graduate school. What are they paying all that extra money for, if not to be better in *every* way they can? It's not like you can't learn this same *material* at UConn, UNH, or even Southern or Gateway for much less money. What's the point in big-ticket education if you come out of it sounding like a drop-out?

The answer probably is that you have found something in this world worth connecting to, worth living for.

So then, what right do you have to rob your child of a possibility of finding his or her love/connection to this world?

also, as a general rule, anytime you are posed with a choice, the easier choice should always be VERY CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED. 

I would argue that not having children is generally seen as an easy way out...so think about it.

in conclusion, the ""suffering/immoralty"" of this world do not seem to be to an extent in my mind to even briefly conclude that someone would not want to be born. further, they can always take their own life if YOU were wrong and this horrible world IS unbearable.

Yeah, the eternal mystery of Liar's Paradox that evades solution by western philosophy to be solved by eastern philosphical hogwas. 

Or maybe not. I have an idea. What if instead of speaking about ""truth"" we replace it by word ""provable"". Suddenly we can restate Liar's Paradox into Godel's first incompleteness theorem. That's neat. 

Now if somebody wants to know more how western philosophy reconciled with this paradox I heavily recommend [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0305282) paper. If you need TL;DR it is this

> The best part of this unified scheme is that it shows that there are really no paradoxes. There are limitations. Paradoxes are ways of showing that if you permit one to violate a limitation, then you will get an inconsistent systems. The Liar paradox shows that if you permit natural language to talk about its own truthfulness (as it - of course - does) then we will have inconsistencies in natural languages. ",philosophy,1
"Why is it unethical to harm an animal for the purpose of eating it? Because you say so? Our species has evolved to consume meat. Our brains and intellect, our societies, our communicative abilities, fire, tools, etc. all evolved out of the fact that humans are a predator species which consumes meat for sustenance to supply our disproportionately powerful brains with energy. Many of the most intelligent species are predators (dolphins, whales, felines, canines, predatory birds (raptors etc.).  The higher intellects observed in non-predator species likely evolved to compete with the intelligence of the predators. 

If it weren't for meat, you wouldn't be here to question the morality of animal husbandry.  If you want to argue we should eat less meat because of the effect on the climate, I'm all ears.

"The whole Frankfurt School PC thing is a bit of a convenient rhetorical and ideological narrative for people who are critical of ""social justice types"". Call such types as ""Cultural Marxists"" and you win, because Marxism is automatically seen as negative by many.

As a narrative, one can go back to [William S. Lind](http://www.marylandthursdaymeeting.com/Archives/SpecialWebDocuments/Cultural.Marxism.htm), who, according to Wikipedia, ""is an American monarchist [and] paleoconservative"". The vague gist of it goes that because orthodox Marxism failed (Russia and not Western Europe were the first to successfully revolt; the USSR was a clear disaster), some Marxists came to believe that *culture* must first be changed before the proletariat can revolt against capitalism. Right off the bat, our alarms should be going off given Marxism's affinity for the base-superstructure model. That is to say that the cultural superstructure is at least partly epiphenomenal to the economic base, and that a change in economic base is more likely to lead to a effective change of the superstructure than the other way around. Of course, the Frankfurt School were not your standard Marxists, and they gave more autonomy to culture from the economic base than vulgar Marxists, but they never got close to a full on reversal of the base-superstructure model (source: Jay's *The Dialectical Imagination*). It also assumes that members of the Frankfurt School were only writing what they wrote, not necessarily because they believed it, but as a means of indoctrinating others and shaping culture first-hand, to make revolution possible. Of course, this is just conjecture made to fit a narrative. It is much more likely that they genuinely believed what they theorized, rather than assuming all of this counter-intuitive conjecture. Most importantly, it also assumes that the Frankfurt School members believed in the plausibility of a revolution in Western society, when in fact some (not all), were notoriously pessimistic (source: Jay's *The Dialectical Imagination, also various writings from Adorno I've read).

This narrative is very much linked to anti-semitism, as [far-right types](http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Marxism) often use this narrative and point out [how Jewish the Frankfurt School was](http://www.dailystormer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Frankfurt-School-Jews-.jpg)^1, and according to the narrative, how evil and Jewish political correctness is. I have noticed that some people try to downplay this though, because anti-semitism isn't going to help this narrative be passed around as easily.

Some criticisms to be made of the narrative itself:

* If all you know from the Frankfurt School is this narrative, you might be fooled into thinking that all it is concerned itself with were certain attitudes and creating a generation of kids who subscribed to liberal identity politics. This is misleading. In fact, the more and more I've read about them, the more it seems that they were concerned with tons of unrelated things. Everything from (1) the social dynamics of fascism (duh they were Marxist Jews who had to run from Hitler) to  (2) the ""culture industry""/rise of mass entertainment to (3) the relation between instrumental reason and the Enlightenment to (4) the relationship between theory and praxis in contemporary capitalism and ""one-dimensional"" society, and so on.

* That ""political correctness"" and common discourses in the realm of liberal identity politics directly descend from the writings of the Frankfurt School. Nothing I've ever seen or read has convinced me of such, but those who regurgitate the narrative simply grant this as a given. As shown above, the promotion typical ""politically correct"" attitudes and discourses were not their primary focus, so the question remains, who promoted these norms/beliefs and in what texts?

* Critics of cultural Marxism assume a kind of idealism in their narrative. Because the Frankfurt School promoted certain ideas, these ideas took hold within society at large. From a Marxist perspective, one may, for the hell of it, ask the question: ""What changes within capitalism have allowed for the possibility of the widespread adoption of 'political correctness' and associated discourses/norms?""

To close off this ramble, here's a vid of old man Ziz, a cultural critic and Marxist who knows what he's talking about, laughing at this narrative. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoOD57-T6O0&t=83m47s

"I'd say, a human simply needs to be uncaring for the happiness of those around him/her, and single-minded in their pursuit of power and wealth. Those individuals will be promoted by corporations when the sole value held by the corporation is monetary gain. It's simple enough to set it up to award higher status to those who's policies make the most money. 

If that's the only deciding factor, other corporations which have more scruples and do not exploit human labour and resources to the fullest extent are ""weaker"" evolutionary, (they make less money, and can't expand as fast) and do not dominate. In this way, the unscrupulous corporations logically rise to the top, simply by making the most profits, and being able to expand most, just as the unscrupulous individuals within those corporations rise.

There are exceptions. A particularly clever individual may discover/invent something new, and profit from it. A person may just happen to hit upon a winning formula and gain a head start on the competition. I hate to say it, but as profit becomes more of a science than an art, and discoveries or inventions are less often made by individual genius's than by teams, I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing fewer exceptions in the future.",philosophy,1

"Homogeneity breeds comfort, ingroup trust, increased empathy, and the desire to help.

People we perceive as ""like"" us are afforded better treatment than those perceived as ""unlike"" us. Homogeneity sounds great if you can make everyone see each other as similar rather than different. But I think there's the rub: there's no evidence that humans are able to psychologically distance themselves from identity and conceptions of identity. Compartmentalization is one of the biggest automatic functions our brain does, evolutionarily. Compartmentalization, even if we didn't personally use labels, would segment people and information by identifying features anyway. So much so that instead of abstract identity labels, we would probably just use adjective labels instead (we already do quite a bit).

Now the fascinating question (that I think remains to be seen) is whether or not humans are capable of acknowledging their identity, accepting it, and transcending beyond it to accept other identities as equally valid. This relies not on a psychological truth about humans being different, but rather on humans making the conscious decision not to hate or fear someone for being ""unlike"" themselves despite our evolutionary predisposition to the contrary.

i guess you could try to get around this by saying that god is the total of all of reality, and thus whatever god's opinion happens to be, must be true everywhere by definition.  but this seems to suggest that, since god is everywhere and everything, then justin bieber is also god, and that his moral opinions are therefore objectively true.  but refuting this brings us to god is everything but justin bieber, and we are back to having two subjects in disagreement.",philosophy,1

"Very ironic how Chomsky talks about 'responsibility' yet refuses to take responsibility for his own erroneous predictions. When the USA went into Afghanistan he said 'Looks like what's happening is some sort of silent genocide.' He then alleged that there was a concerted American attempt to starve and kill between three and four million Afghan people. When asked, two years later, about his false prediction he said:

 ""That is an interesting fabrication, which gives a good deal of insight into the prevailing moral and intellectual culture. First, the facts: I predicted nothing... All of this is precisely accurate and entirely appropriate. The warnings remain accurate as well, a truism that should be unnecessary to explain. Unfortunately, it is apparently necessary to add a moral truism: actions are evaluated in terms of the range of anticipated consequences.""

"I don't think you can answer this question without considering that we need to eat animal products for certain micronutrients and vitamins. Not to mention the efficiency and bioavailability of of meat as a protein vehicle. 

And considering that, I think my concern is this:

No, it is not morally permissible to kill animals for food. There is one particular alternative to killing animals that I think could be positive. Let animals die before eating them. Of course, this will raise the net cost of animal husbandry since there are many species that provide no use during life (as opposed to cows that can produce dairy along the way), but these costs will pass on to the consumer. Meat will be more expensive, quantity demanded will go down. The industry will raise less animals, thereby shrinking demand, until we reach an equilibrium of only those who can afford to eat animals will eat them. Now here is the problem, because meat is good for your diet and everyone should have access to it. 

So, is it morally permissible to make meat too expensive for the poor?",philosophy,1

"Every time I read something like this I want to remind people that in (USA) 1920 prohibition wasn't just about banning alcohol but also most other drugs and prostitution. 

Our society took 13 years to realize that making something illegal will not stop the demand for it. But if you make something illegal, that people are going to buy anyway, then the justice system has created its own crime wave. 

We learned that lesson when we repealed the alcohol portion of prohibition but not the drugs nor prostitution parts of the law. 

In the USA no one is getting shot trying to buy a beer and it's much harder for a minor to get alcohol than it is for them to get hard drugs.   But we have a huge international network of crime, terror, and smuggling of drugs and humans. All that could much more easily be address if we took the same route as we did for alcohol. Legalize (not just decriminalize), regulate, and tax the production, distribution, sale, and use of drugs and sex. 

If we want to win the ""drug war"" just stop fighting it and treat addicts as medical patients not moral degenerates. 

If we want to stop human sex trafficking make prostitution legal and safe. Then the illegal activity will be far more rare and easy to spot as human trafficking. ",philosophy,1

It's a simple question really:  In a scenario where you can save someone's life 100 meters away with the same amount of effort that it would take to save someone 1 meter away, why would it be reasonable to conclude that the first person actually matters less as an individual?

"As a child, I imagined that out there in the world somewhere were people who used language like how it is in books; or rather, my favourite stories and poems. Economical, light, beautifully formed - saying exactly what was meant, but leaving space for interpretation - for the gap that must exist between people. A prismatic joy that would not be so coarse as to overstate its purpose. I imagined this somewhat out of despair at the cloddish way that almost everyone I grew up around - and I really am speaking mainly of adults here - clung to the dull certainties of their words as if Moses himself had chiselled them out of dry camel shit. Elders threw up perimeters of scaly soul-leather that one was expected to polish with perfect deeds - oh, and one knew that one must never, ever point out how completely unaware they were of their own grossness and imprecision. Meanwhile, a select group of children my age - middle managers of the future, these seagull bosses of the schoolyard - tut-tutted and hectored anyone who dare get a word 'wrong', or use it creatively, or simply speak of things these champs had no knowledge of. 

I did not, exactly, find that magical land whereof I dreamt. I moved to a country that is socially minimal - conversational extravagance is frowned upon; to call someone a 'raconteur' would be tantamount to calling them a liar, or worse, un-serious. But it is so for a reason - this is a place that favours the silent, right-brain mode of formatting life. Words are a way of roughly delineating a state of visual-mystical-synthetic meditation. I find it pretty dry dull stuff, usually, and the tendency to bluntness is often used to prop up some pretty lame, provincial arrogance - they are not big on arguing things through. But, this place punches well above its weight in visual art and music, not to mention raw maverick genius of all types, so you can hardly say it doesn't work for them. 

Everywhere, words are tools used to achieve outcomes. If I try to speak and write well, then you may say that I seek the outcome of pleasure, or wit, or persuasion, or any of a million postures that language affects to effect a goal. Others are in the business of control; and control is not always the same thing as precision. Where you smell oppression and the sulfourous sput of power politics, you'll hear plenty of Bad Language; but is it words which brought these actors to the play? I don't buy it. Power is something else. It lives in that silent space which masterminds, lurks, plays with and peddles myths and the mythic. When Thomas de Quincey argued that literature was that which sought to communicate power, he meant the power to transfer and evoke affect - which undoubtedly is part of the Bad Rhetorician's repertoire - but I do not think he meant that words in their highest form were the sole province of those who seek to oppress by those words' power. Not on your nelly, my only sunshine.

So... really, Byrne's reading of language is obviously a pretty choked and chicken-livered one... but... BUT it brings up something I wish we'd all grab hold of more often, which is that in all the fields which have the backing of power - industry and commerce, say - it isn't controversial to expect and seek out the best method of organising energies, to permit the most heightened, yet realistic integration with the energies of the world-in-total. Yet, do the same thing with language and one might as well be a stormcock calling across the sea. So isn't it really a case of power selecting and restricting language, rather than language casting its net on us... and therefore isn't Byrne's argument a little reactionary, something of a furphy, displaying the hallmarks of modern conservative Breitbartian backwash?

"I'm not saying that being immortal would make us fearless. I am saying that we do the things we do because they are intrinsically enjoyable and therefore we would not stop doing them should we discover we were immortal. They are not done to assuage or sublimate death, they are done because they are innately enjoyable. That is the point of the thought experiment. I don't think values, character or self esteem would disappear if death disappeared. I think they operate on their own, even though they exist because they ultimately aid our survival and reproduction. I do not think my moral views on slavery would be altered if we were all immortal either. They are innate to our makeup and exist before we know death. I have seen small children outraged at what they perceive as injustice. This is an innate craving for justice and to be treated fairly. The child does not need to know death and build its ego upon some ideal of justice that transcends death. The child is simply outraged. Unfairness just feels bad. Most things in life are this way. Rebecca called Tom ugly and that hurt Tom's feelings. Janet loves her child and would throw herself in deaths way to save it. I don't think you feeling good at making Reddit front page has any connection to death. The surge of good feelings from attention is not a relief from mortality, it is a trigger that is pulled when a flood of positive social attention is received. It exists before any concept of death exists. As children we come to know our emotions. You see a snarling dog and you feel fear. No idea or concept had to be held to feel that fear. Same with the soothing sound of your mothers voice. Nothing had to tell you that felt great. This is the general way of people. The evolutionary prompt for these feelings is survival and procreation, but those do not characterize the actual feeling of being a human. It seems that you take it for a fact that life is utterly desolate and that every ""good"" we know is a denial of this primal fact. I could just as easily hold that life is completely blissful and radiant but we are simply deceived because we take our horrors to be real and serious things when they are in fact not. They are equally solipsistic positions that can never be disproved because they place themselves prior to all empirical evidence. Should evidence turn up to counter them they have a built in mechanism for dismissal.

"I am no big believer in the concept of the singularity, but I don't find your criticism particularly strong. Some brief responses.

1) Technology already has post-human abilities. Granted, they're far from equal to us in every area, but they've already surpassed us in quite a number. Crucially, once we figure out how to implement it into code, computers are almost always faster than we are. This is important for the concept of a singularity. 

Heck, humanity demonstrated the inefficiency of evolution (That it has to build atop itself piece by piece), as soon as we built the wheel. 

Additionally, your claim is about to be rendered directly and factually untrue as efforts to enhance human intelligence begin. We're on the brink of breakthroughs, including iterated embryo selection, that could make future generations a hell of a lot smarter than humanity currently is. 

2) I don't.... entirely understand what you mean here. Of course value is subjective? Why couldn't a machine have a value function in its code - some already do. A superintelligence could absolute optimize all its improvements for ""Accomplish some X"".

3) Along a similar lines, there's no reason to assume the superintelligence will value its own survival beyond accomplishing its goals. The desire to survive is something in us because of genetics, not as some inherent faculty of intellect. If all a superintelligence wanted to do was increase X, then it would absolutely make more superintelligences with the same value function, or better ones.

4) We were moving slower toward one in 400 AD, too. Limits and technological improvement speed changes. A twenty-year alteration means absolutely nothing from a the global historical perspective in which human advancement has continued relentlessly for ten thousand years. Problems do increase in complexity, but our communication, cooperation, education, and design technologies have all increased as well. And, crucially, invention is increasingly something down by groups of individuals. 

The low-hanging fruit of individual invention has probably been plucked, but if there was to be a superintelligence, it would not be some lone programmer in their basis with an epiphany - but a huge effort with geniuses each working on a tiny piece of the whole. ",philosophy,1

"In your definition of science, yes. There are scenario's that objectively can confirm certain claims true by using science. For example, banning carbon tetrachloride or harmful chemicals. We all hold the value of our lives and want to be safe from harmful contaminants.
 To play the devil's advocate you've brought a very big word into the discussion which is freedom as well. Typically people view freedom as synonymous which liberty (especially in the US).  You may conceptualize that as ""freedom from"" or ""freedom to"". Many people see the interference from others as the anti thesis to freedom. In this case interference from the state is ideally kept low. You may look it as there are certain natural rights , that all humans hold, and the states provide freedom by eliminating those forms of interference that violate those rights. If these rights are not discussed in under the constraints of mutual engagement then they fail to be sufficient for freedom. Furthermore even a majority rule brings no guarantee of decreasing interference in ways that protect rights or personal projects, or of doing so in a way that treats all citizens equally. As i sort of eluded to already there are many people who feel science seeks to change the ways of life they cherish.

With no official division of epistemic labor it is difficult to converge at a basic level of values as well. With the current value free ideal, junk science, and a slew of other factors its very easy for discredit any one side, creating mistrust. The issue is, no quick solutions are made. One side can always call for further evidence or more discussion. We see this with climate change. Water rights and particularly privatizing water rights is a big human rights issue.

"If the majority of businesses owners aren't heroes like that (and they aren't, or else we wouldn't have needed unions during the industrial revolution), then either we're admitting that people are naturally shitty (and that we thus need to regulate them), or we're admitting that complete business freedom for people leads to unnatural shittiness (and that we thus need to regulate them).

There is no instance where the historical data broadly backs up Rand's perspective on the humans that her ideal society leads to. And that's the problem. The closest we can get is by looking at microcosm societies that are *very* homogeneous, which results in a sociological tendency to trust and care about your neighbor more than in heterogeneous societies (i.e. Norway vs. US where Norway's lack of minimum wage works well, but the US's didn't). But even that doesn't really hold up since well-functioning homogeneous societies also tend to have quite a lot of regulation otherwise.

Rand *wanted* people to treat each other/strangers well voluntarily, but the problem is that we don't as often as we do.

"&gt;&gt;""These same structures could be experienced as different beliefs in different people, or even different animals.""

&gt;I don't see why you would think that's true. In fact, I'd expect that only on dualism, and certainly not on naturalism wherein mental states and neurological states share in token-identities.

No, this will only work with naturalism. With dualism there is in some way more than just neurological states. In naturalism, what we speak about as consciousness, or self, or ""I"", must be a product of neurological states. These structures are products of genetics &amp; environmentally conditioned neuroplasticity. So the structures that make ""I"" and that ""experience beliefs"" are just processing information (outputs) from other structures.
With this in mind, the output of a low-level structure that evolved early on in vertebrate history and has always been advantageous could be processed differently by the higher level structures that produce ""I"", and that processing could be (and probably would be, given the complexity of the systems doing the processing) experienced differently by different ""I"" producing structures, and by the higher-level processing of differing species. How those higher levels rationalize that low-level output is immaterial, it produces its output that gives a small advantage to the host.

Please note that this entire argument assumes naturalism, all terms regarding the mind, experience, beliefs are to be read with the understanding that these terms are just descriptions for neural states.",philosophy,0

"I grew up steeped in religious literature. I know the arguments and have read catechisms and devotions and some of Lee Strobel's books. Yes, the Bible is a collective work. And since the Bible, people have formed arguments, some of them even expressing doubt that God exists from time to time, or at least considering the doubt valid. Yet I'm just past the point of seeing how you could build an argument that God exists, since I don't believe there are any facts to support it. So therefore yeah, I do think religion requires you to ignore skepticism. At least my religion did. Because it taught that if you didn't believe a man died and rose again to forgive your sins you weren't Christian. I mean you can argue that religion is following a set of rules and has nothing to do with faith if you want. But that requires you to ignore that other customs could be better than yours if you're repeating rituals that have been performed for thousands of years.

Maybe it's just that most of the vocal religious people I hear have no scientific background at all and just believe in a higher power just because it's ingrained in them to protect them from the stress of knowing you're going to die. I don't hear very many educated people explain their thoughts without some major leap of faith (opposite of skepticism) or logical flaw.

However, when you delve into fields like statistical mechanics it because very useful to use things like n-dimensional spaces. These are no longer physical spaces, like a chunk of 4-dimensional spacetime, but nonetheless help us model extremely large quantities of stuff (like atoms in bulk) and their large-scale behavior.

You can actually apply the image of quantum decoherence to this metaphorically. It fits perfectly, because everything is fractal. The problem is that the research on quantum decoherence is focused on the micro-levels of physics instead of on what's really important; it hides itself from sight of Nature, like so many things in science. It's one of the pitfalls of a given consciousness if that consciousness assumes it's a study of physics, and that, at best, it only provides some philosophical thought experiments or whatever advances in technology or science. Of course it doesn't mean that the research completely ignorant or completely useless, that just depends on the consciousness concerned.

And here are the first two poems from _Fungi from Yuggoth_:  

""I. The Book

The place was dark and dusty and half-lost  
In tangles of old alleys near the quays,  
Reeking of strange things brought in from the seas,  
And with queer curls of fog that west winds tossed.  
Small lozenge panes, obscured by smoke and frost,  
Just shewed the books, in piles like twisted trees,  
Rotting from floor to roof—congeries  
Of crumbling elder lore at little cost.  

I entered, charmed, and from a cobwebbed heap  
Took up the nearest tome and thumbed it through,  
Trembling at curious words that seemed to keep  
Some secret, monstrous if one only knew.  
Then, looking for some seller old in craft,  
I could find nothing but a voice that laughed.  

II. Pursuit  

I held the book beneath my coat, at pains  
To hide the thing from sight in such a place;  
Hurrying through the ancient harbor lanes  
With often-turning head and nervous pace.  
Dull, furtive windows in old tottering brick  
Peered at me oddly as I hastened by,  
And thinking what they sheltered, I grew sick  
For a redeeming glimpse of clean blue sky.  

No one had seen me take the thing—but still  
A blank laugh echoed in my whirling head,  
And I could guess what nighted worlds of ill  
Lurked in that volume I had coveted.    
The way grew strange—the walls alike and madding—  
And far behind me, unseen feet were padding.""

Force is purely abstract unless talked about in context of something else. It can be in opposition to or in support of hierarchy.

",philosophy,0
"&gt; Do we know that consciousness is a Turing complete machine?

I'm not sure how to answer that - that statement doesn't really make sense to me. My point is that Searle's argument applies to any computer in as much as it is a computer based on our theoretical understanding of computing. That's a very strong statement already, so there's no need at this point to imagine future machines that nobody has conceived yet, that work using principles we cannot fathom. It's interesting enough to talk about computers as they exist now and will exist in the foreseeable future. (Btw stuff like quantum computing can provide speed improvements, but are also ""merely"" Turing equivalent.)

&gt;And if it is, it seems like the important question is the results the machine produces, but the way.

Yeah, that's the entire point. The Chinese room is a Turing complete machine, therefore it does things, in some profound sense, in the same way as a computer.

&gt;And if by ""think"" we mean, ""the way humans think"", then that implies consciousness has some role in the process.

Just as much as it implies that DNA or blood or myellin sheaths have some role in the process. In Turing's own words:

""I propose to consider the question, ""Can machines think?"" This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms ""machine"" and ""think."" The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous, If the meaning of the words ""machine"" and ""think"" are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, ""Can machines think?"" is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words. ""

This is replaced by something like ""How well can a machine play the imitation game"".

In short, Turing gets rid of all the ambiguities by replacing a vague question by an experimental one. It's sort of a trick and can be criticized. My point is simply that the Turing test should be taken for what it is, nothing more, nothing less. It does not say much about consciousness by design.",philosophy,0

"&gt; No, metaphysics gets a bad rap because people use a version of it all the time to ""prove"" their pseudoscience, such as the ""facts"" of souls because we have consciousness, the ""facts"" of ESP because we have emotional bonds, the ""facts"" of supernatural beings because all things that we can conceive must exist in other possible worlds, and therefore our world.

So basically you are saying clueluess laypeople focusing on a minority of professionals and even more strongly on an even larger quantity of non-philosophers (which they cannot even tell apart from actual philosophers), and who do not even know that everyone has implied metaphysical views anyway as long they use language, etc etc, somehow disprove my statement? The first part, which you brought up, is only possible because people are clueless in the ways I described. Also, what you mention about ""conceivables"" is just one among many positions. 

&gt; I don't have issues with metaphysics from a logical framework, and as a method to explore concepts. I think it is particularly useful for framing subjective questions, such as ethics or cultural norms,

Let us be clear about what we are talking about. Almost all statements in epistemology, logic, and regarding ""actual"" things, etc etc are already metaphysical to at least some extent, if not wholly so. If you use language you will have to use metaphysics. Due to evolution common conceptions and cognitive faculties might work well empirically (i.e. google evolutionary epistemology), e.g. like the perception of distinct entities while moving around, but that does not mean they are totally given by the things themselves as e.g. the differing behavior of different animals towards a variety of objects already shows. As such, whenever you use your reason or rationality, i.e. divide reality in some way, work as if you had a conceptual scaffolding, etc etc you are already relying on metaphysics. Like Bunge once wrote: Ignorance of philosophy leads to ignorant philosophy, not no philosophy. This obviously includes our unquestioned metaphysical and epistemological standpoints.

Btw the sciences are chock-full of metaphysics, and even nonsense metaphysics. E.g. see this book: https://www.amazon.com/Philosophical-Foundations-Neuroscience-M-Bennett/dp/140510838X

Secondly, it is by no means obvious that morality is subjective in any way that implies an arbitrariness which would differentiate it e.g. from maths. Arguments for my position are e.g. the convergent unfolding of premises, resurgence of the same kinds of views in different cultures and times (e.g. virtue ethics, utilitarianism, soteriological approaches, etc), the conditional hypothetico-deductive nature of ethical propositions being no different from other propositions including mathematical ones which are commonly seen as nonsubjective, etc etc. Ethics seems only subjective in the sense that -like all cognition we know of- it requires a subject. Of course, due to strong empirical underdetermination and meta-ethics etc we have an even bigger problem space than e.g. in the natural sciences. But in the end, once you specified your methods, made explicit your assumptions and intuitions, etc etc you will reach very definite results (including the inclusion of empirical evidence regarding matters of application). And imho there is only so much you can do to ""go meta"" before the relevance of your abstract considerations for lower level abstractions is quasi nonexistent. As such, while taking tons of time and energy, ethics being a work in progress like the sciences or some unfinished set of differently built cathedrals among which to decide ultimately (or sth like that), does not make ethics itself undecidable or arbitrary. Or something you can just ignore without being inconsistent in your treatment of ethics compared to all kinds of other ""random"" statements for that matter. Btw a majority of professional philosophers, who spend most their working lives considering such matters, are actually moral realists. A fact which should have at least some heuristic value. Lastly, people disagreeing about or not yet knowing the actual facts of a matter does not mean there are no such facts.

&gt;To me, the statement ""X can be thought of"" is very different from the statement ""X exists,"" and while a thought may be useful, I've yet to find a solid argument that thoughts ""exist"" in the sense of ""being"" outside the minds that conceive of them.

I already linked you to platonism, and gave you arguments like the fact that you have a certain thought seems to imply that thinking that thought should have been possible before you had that thought in some sense, the fact that other people are sometimes having the same thoughts etc etc. This seems to imply that the ""world"" seemingly works in a way similar to as if there was some total set of all thinkables already in place. Or at least we can imagine something like that, as e.g. Borges library. Anyway, it all seems to hinge on your definition of existence. Some people even proposed to ""split"" the word because of issues like that. Also, afaik what the kind of people you criticise would generally claim is not that those thoughts just exist outside the mind, but that they *also* 'exist' outside of it in some abstract realm of ""platonic"" possibility. I.e. there is something like conceptual existence (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/).

"&gt; •I argue that they way they separate physical from nonphysical fields doesn't make sense. Specifically, that psychology should be included with other physical sciences if we're going to use a consistent definition of ""physical"" (as opposed to an acedemic definition for example).

This seems to be the key distinction you seem to struggle with. You asserted all these things, but you haven't presented any kind of argument, to the best of my knowledge. Even if I accept that your original assertion constitutes an argument, you've done nothing to respond to the specific passages I cited from the paper. To me, this constitutes a direct violation of rules #1 and #2 of this sub. You aren't presenting explicit arguments or reading carefully.

&gt; •You say that I can't use a definition that puts psychology in the same group as other physical sciences because the authors don't. This seems to be a basic misunderstanding of what I'm redefining, or maybe just how arguments work?

This is pretty telling, for example. Maybe you were just asking a rhetorical question, but this isn't how arguments work. You can't just assert an unmotivated counter-definition as an argument. For starters, it isn't compelling. Even if you had special oracle-class insight into the truth, your proclamations aren't persuasive as bare claims.

More importantly, counter-arguments should be addressed to the specific positions they are leveled against. None of your response on this post seems related to the substance of this essay. It seems like you took an article about physicalism as a chance to get on your soap box. This entire efforts seems like a plug for your blog. Again, you don't seem interested in logical engagement or close reading.

&gt; •You tell me that what I'm describing is neurophysiology. Which is saying that I'm either too dumb or too inexperienced to tell two fields apart. It would undoubtedly make more sense to assume that I can tell that those are different things and that I was arguing that psychology has some characteristics in common with fields like neurophysiology, such that they could all be included in the very broad category of studying physical things.

Honestly, I assumed you didn't read this essay with an eye for details. I thought you could recognize your mistake if I presented textual evidence.

&gt; •I point out that your counter argument is circular or that you completely missed the point (perhaps because I didn't explain it clearly enough or perhaps because of poor reading comprehensions skills)

I haven't presented a counter-argument really. I don't need to, since you haven't presented an argument to begin with.

"""it's not more beneficial then[sic] the market value directly being siphoned off by many high frequency traders"". 

I honestly have no idea what that even means. It seems like you don't seem to understand what HFT is. HFT is just a term that means trading at high frequency. It's not a trading strategy, it's just something you do (making trades very quickly by using a computer to place orders). A company's market value cannot be siphoned off by many high frequency traders. That doesn't make any sense. Yes, a stock's liquidity is logarithmic to quantity, but with HFT players like Citadel, SIG, w/e, making markets for securities that are not usually traded, you can find someone willing to take the other side on a financial instrument you're trying to trade. Also, ""we alrady have mostly sufficient liquidity without HFT?"" HA good one bro. Have you looked at the spreads in the 80s? You wanna pay a fucking dollar on the spread of spy every time you try to hedge? The spread of liquid securities like spy has now fallen down to 1-2 cents because of HFT. Computerized Trading has it's drawbacks (too many flash crashes), but over all it's really pushed financial markets in a much better direction.

I don't think you can jump straight to that.  What theory of consciousness are you subscribing to?  What ideas are you assuming?

If anything, the thousands of years of literature show that we don't agree on what consciousness is.

&gt; it's a question about what happens to consciousness when we're not conscious.

Ok, so can you describe all the circumstances under which we are not conscious, and what kind of a thing consciousness is?  Are you sure something needs to ""happen to it"" when we're not conscious?  What makes you think it's anything like a ""reboot""?

I think you've got to explain your concept a bit better here, because I'm not sure I would agree that we're conscious while dreaming, or during a trance-like state.  So we might not be talking about the same thing when we talk about ""consciousness"".  For example, do you think animals are generally conscious?  All of them?  Some of them?  Which ones?

"&gt; The scholastics, the Aristotelian Catholic philosophers of the Middle Ages, were so impressed with the mind’s grasp of necessary truths as to conclude that the intellect was immaterial and immortal. If today’s naturalists do not wish to agree with that, there is a challenge for them. ‘Don’t tell me, show me’: build an artificial intelligence system that imitates genuine mathematical insight. There seem to be no promising plans on the drawing board.

The thing is that, from the mathematician's perspective (and I'm talking about mathematicians from Ph. D.'s down to the five-year-old learning to understand a simpler ""taller-than"" relation), we often *do* approach it as sort of a game of semantics; we get perfectly well how to understand things as being true in virtue of their meaning, and that's more or less how we first start tackling necessary truths. Borrowing the analogy of the five-year-old again, it's easy to get that ""Harry is taller than Brad"" because either we get that 5 feet is greater than 4 feet (taking a simplified notion of numbers here and allowing the pre-schooler's version of something like ""5 is the next number 'up' from 4""), or if we're comparing visually, we get that to be ""taller"" means that the top of Harry's head terminates at a point higher than Brad's when they stand on the same level plane. It *may* be fair to suggest that mathematical reality does not exist in a realm apart from ours, but this is *not* immediately why we are able to tackle it with what seems like unusually adept intuition.

As has been said in this thread already, though, this article really misses the fact that there are mathematical concepts that have no immediate basis in reality. Think even of those post-calculus ""foundations of mathematics"" courses where students are asked to construct their own basic axiomatic system and devise proofs of theorems easily derived from the axioms. Even if the concepts those students expose eventually *do* connect up to reality, that is hardly the first thing on the student's mind when they start constructing the basic setup, and the fact that we can still flesh out those systems without a need to consult those connections provides some initial support to the argument against Franklin here.

Here's my last response that you might not have gotten:

Read the wikipedia of The Library of Babel. It's finite. The logic is simple. Given the constraints, there are only so many permutations of the books in the library. The permutations necessarily describe everything possible and impossible. Therefore, no infinity. 

For any book that makes sense, there are multiple sequels that make sense. One succession of sequels can describe the chronological progression of literally anything, without repeating any books, because for any book there is its narrative equivalent, within which the same story is described, only using slightly different wording, so the idea that repetitions of certain books would be necessary falls apart when you consider the contents of any book are described equivalently in every possible way. If you need more repetitions than that, there might be something wrong with the meaningfulness of that universe anyway.


Certainly, every possible and impossible human life is described, in every conceivable way, so possibility, as it directly relates to humanity, is inarguably finite. You could say the same about any possible or impossible conscious entity. If all that will ever be observed by conscious entities is necessarily finite, I'm not even sure how the argument against my position really even matters. And why would anyone say that those areas can't be fully described? 

Also, the constraints of the library are arbitrary. You could say there are as many pages per book as there are particles in the universe, and the number of books would still be finite, as would be the possible orderings of those books.

"Heres my take on it and I hope i'm placing this correctly, but if I remember right, at this part in the discussion Wolff is distinguishing between three different modes rule activity? In the first mode, the activity always proceeds the rule. in the second there are things (dare I say concepts) that encompass the rule and things that are entirely not apart of it. And third, if I remember right, is a judgment on ""whether the rule is going according to the way its suppose to go"". So regarding the first characteristic, i.e., the traffic light example. I think the purpose or meaning he is trying to convey is that traffic light rules were created with the intention to govern the activity of human behavior. I think he gets a bit ahead of himself in this example because he also begins to illuminate other themes later in his talk, such as the issue with induction and, one in the same, the point you bring up in your post. If you remember, the objection against induction is that valid and invalid arguments have the same characteristics. Likewise, in the example he gives, the intended rule of traffic lighting states, that when it is yellow then the driver must slow down. According to the third characteristic he lays out, this would be a valid obedience to the intended rule. Notice that if as you say, you derive the meaning from the 'behavior' of the driver, then one could claim that this would be a misappropriation of the intended rule. I think Wollfe brings it up to begin with because it becomes characteristic of an invalid argument. This is because we are using ones behavior as the creator of rule making (as opposed to some unifying physical law) and it becomes invalid because we find ourselves presupposing the very thing we're trying to solve, namely that thing which governs the behavior of our own mental activities.

When I took epistemology my friends and I talked a lot about a case where to all third-person external observers, an individual appeared quite guilty of a certain crime; video evidence, an eye-witness or two, etc. However, the individual in question, while recognizing how bad it looks and how reasonable everyone is to find him guilty, cannot himself believe in his guilt because he not only has no memory of performing such criminal acts, but distinctly remembers, as well he has ever remembered anything, having done something very different at the same time on the other side of town. He sees the external evidence, but his internal sense of reality, through memory and lack thereof, prevents him believing in his own guilt. 


If I were in this individual's position, how should I regard my own ken? Is my strong internal understanding of the facts enough to justify holding to my innocence against some fairly damning external evidence?

When we actually perform the operation, we only see the eigenvalue (measurement value) corresponding to that particular component of the superposition, and then the system is exactly in that state. Thus there's a large difference between a measurement and a quantum operation that preserves superpositions. I don't think in general that most quantum operations preserve superpositions.

"&gt; They spend a lot of time essentially arguing that psychology is a ""mental"" field and contrasting it with the ""physical"" fields like physics and chemistry. I have no problem calling psychology a physical field. It deals with the physical behavior of humans and what's going on in their physical brain.

&gt;&gt; 'Physical science' so construed certainly includes physics proper. Physics is the paradigm (hence 'physical'). And chemistry, molecular biology and neurophysiology are also indisputably physical sciences. But not psychology, sociology, and economics.

This re-definition isn't won't fly, when the authors explicitly contrast neurophysiology with psychology. What you described clearly falls under neurophysiology. Therefore, it kind of misses the point all together.

&gt;It's only if we assume that stuff that happens in brains isn't physical that we can conclude psychology is a ""mental"" science.

This seems a little flippant given the entire 20+ pages is dedicated to arguing for this classification. Also, the authors never refer to psychology as a ""mental"" science in the first place. Referring to psychology as a ""human science"", as the paper does, is well-established, or at least a coherent historical perspective. I don't know why you are picking a fight here.

&gt; The entire discussion about ""what physics"" future or presents seems ridiculous. Of course it's the best, most accurate, possible. The only counterargument to that is ""but then we won't know what's physical now"" - which is kind of the point, science leaves open the possibility of imperfect information or future discoveries. A requirement that we have to have perfect information now seems completely unrealistic.

You're totally missing the point. This isn't a problem about understanding a particular physical phenomena. This isn't even a problem about the open possibility of discovering radically different physical phenomena. The problem is knowing whether a given phenomena is physical in the first place.

"&gt; But then you are essentially agreeing with Plantinga. If you agree that a strict naturalism leads to coherentism, you are agreeing with his premise that naturalism eliminates our access to some higher, more abstract or foundational level of knowledge.

Right. I'm not too fond of the idea of the perfect reason of the mind, a la Scholasticism or Cartesian-era rationalism. Platinga, unfortunately, starts with the assumption that we *can* ascertain reality perfectly, and that we *do indeed* have a perfectly rational mind. Yet this begs the question.

His overaching goal, though, is to prove how accepting naturalism is incompatible with accepting evolution, because accepting evolution would be to believe it to be true, but a naturalistic universe would not guarantee that this is true.

But this, in any case, is presupposing foundationalism, and also depends on a faulty view of evolution that equivocates all selection with the selection going on in the savage wild. From a pragmatist view, truth is more an estimation than correlation. We obtain truth when we are reasonably confident, i.e. certain, that it will perform well when applied elsewhere. Indeed our ancestors would have needed to know when something was happening in their environment just as we do now; and if that isn't knowledge-like than I don't know what is. The idea that we have access to the real world (assuming it exists) is a fantasy, a necessary illusion for our concepts to even work.

That is exactly it! Complexity is really what we're talking about.   If you remove the world 'digital' from your post, we are exactly on the same page.

First, as a baseline, we have to accept that there are some problems that can't be solved--they are non computable.

A thought experiment: pick A, B, or C.   What did you choose? 

You decided on a result based on a process, one in where you had a selection of outputs to pick from.  Your selection wasn't random--even if you picked ""Green"" or ""Underpants""--but nor was it deterministic.   It was, by all accounts, the result of a quantum automata, one that cannot be translated into silicon.  More then likely, all states were selected, and then reduced, in nanoseconds, to a single state.   

The complexity of choosing from A, B or C via concious thought is simply too great for digital devices.  It has less to do with the inherent complexities of the process, and everything to do with the physical properties of the processes in question: we don't have to know what we don't know.

"It is somewhat scary that some academics can be pushed to say something like this (*""2+2 is not an interesting question""*). If 2+2 is not 4, then we cease to understand anything about modern science: How do we make houses/cars/satellites/medicine? How do we decide on economic policy, how do we fund philosophy departments, how do we feed Stanley Fish? The consequences are enormous: the entire organization of empirical knowledge would fall apart, innovation would either stop entirely or restart in a different direction, etc. Anyone who cares about their way of life must care about ""2+2"", because their life literally depends on it. 

It is not a surprise to me that Stanley Fish has a background in theory of law and literary criticism: these are two of the domains which are furthest removed from interaction with the material (=non-discursive) world. Literary criticism in particular often relies on arguments that are divorced from experience and therefore immune to empirical refutation. This lack of interaction with the world has corrupted large swathes of these disciplines: with experience out of the picture, anything goes. The fabric of human societies and the knowledge that underlies it can be ignored.

Back to Stanley Fish, his answer is that all knowledge is tied to men's *ambitions*. If geometry was to cross someone's ambition, it would come to be disputed (just like, say, evolution or global warming). And, sure, what matters is men's ambition. What Fish fails to see, from an ivory tower of tenure built by people who care about ""2+2"", is that the ambition of men is not limited to the academic world of discourse. Ambition also conflicts with empirical reality. When that happens, ""falsehood"" has consequences. Evolution and global warming are good examples.

(Also the passage about Wittgenstein was hilarious. Clearly the speaker who brought up W just had a very vague idea of the Tractacus existing, and wanted to do some name-dropping...)

PS: unsurprisingly, here's what Fish believes about the humanities: *""To the question 'of what use are the humanities?', the only honest answer is none whatsoever. And it is an answer that brings honor to its subject. Justification, after all, confers value on an activity from a perspective outside its performance. An activity that cannot be justified is an activity that refuses to regard itself as instrumental to some larger good. The humanities are their own good. There is nothing more to say, and anything that is said diminishes the object of its supposed praise.""*... and for good measure [here's](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/february11/future-arts-humanities-fish-021109.html) what a bunch of smart people have to say about it.",philosophy,0

"Being against war, but not using your intellect to truly understand the causes and those responsible is shirking your responsibility. 

For example with the EU. There is a concensus among intellectuals that the EU is a positive entity with little to no comment on its use as a projection of Anglo-American hegemony in the form of NATO influence. We are seeing the consequences of this soft expansion in places like the Ukraine with the west being able to claim no responsibility as if interest in EU membership was simply a spotanteus act of democratic will by the Ukrainian people. Whether or not this is true - the benefits demand (according to Chomsky) that instead of simply complying with consensus... that concerning questions be asked.

Now I am not interested in discussing the EU... but rather I am using it as an example where responsibility of the intellectual is being shirked, a consensus has been formed and no investigation or consideration is taking place.

Obviously false. You can hold a defective machine responsible for it's actions and throw it in the trash so it doesn't cause any further harm.

FWIW my exposure to this topic, to the idea that we might not have the kind of free will that everyone thinks we do, has changed nothing about how I live my life with the exception of believing that vengeance/retribution for their own sake is wrong. Any punishment we levy on anyone for any action should be utilitarian... either preventative or rehabilitatory.

&gt;In the example above, how can we blame the rapist for their actions? If we assume he did not have free will, then it was simply a matter of chance, biology, and chemical processes that ended up creating his choice to plan out a rape. 

Yep, but that doesn't mean we take no action in response to it.

&gt;I'm not convinced that assuming rapists are blameless for their actions leads to ""better"" results

In that we don't seek to harm people for the sake of vengeance or retribution, but only for prevention or rehabilitation.

&gt; does that make sense?

The argument is not new to me, it is merely circular. It assumes God is just to get to the conclusion that God is just.

If every single person has a ""true opportunity"" to be saved in any meaningful sense, the percentage of people raised non-Christian who become Christian would have to be the same as the percentage of people raised Christian who stay Christian. This is not even close to true.

&gt; it's a simple solution to the ""soteriological problem"" that most traditional christian religions have. no ""extraordinary mental gymnastics"" required.

I think it requires considerable gymnastics to ignore the plain fact that if faith in Jesus is required for salvation, there is overwhelming evidence that the luck of being born into a Christian family is the dominant factor in who is saved.

That does not seem like a system created by anything resembling a just God.

In my view the real reason why the promise of salvation has to be restricted to paying customers only is that otherwise there is no reason for people to give money, attention and status to a parasitic class of priests. It has nothing to do with whether a just God would actually run such a protection racket, which is an extremely implausible claim.

Using this example, the earth would overpopulate and die off, or we find a solution to keep humanity's variables acting in that specific universe; it would be understood that within that universe, there would be nearly infinite universal outcomes 'spinning' or 'branching' off of that universe, creating more outcomes. My assumption is that over time, the less stable universes will offer less and less universal outcomes that contain human variables, while the more stable ones create the majority of the outcomes.
This poses a few questions, though. Does the 'spinoff' universes abide by the same universal physics/laws that our universe does? Perhaps the time the universe was created makes the difference in it's physics; while it would be seemingly unimaginable for a universe to split and create new physics, but what if the universal splits could date back to the point these physics were created? This would make it more understandable that when a physical law was being stated, it could create multiple universes with all different variations of each physical law.
If this is possible, then there should be universes where no other universes exist, but it would be filed as indeterminate or possibly even 0, removing it from the active universal 'line'.

A judge tells his prisoner he will be hanged yesterday or tomorrow and that it will be a surprise.

The prisoner concludes that he cannot be hanged because he has already lived through yesterday so the only day he can be hanged is tomorrow. Since he knows this, it will not be a surprise.

Tomorrow arrives and the prisoner is hanged. He is surprised.

I believe that the paradox arises from the prisoner's assumption that the judge's ""surprise"" pertains only to the knowledge of which day of the week the hanging will occur. In turn, he builds his own expectations and reasoning, concluding that he cannot be hanged.

"But the *behavior* is caused by a belief, and its content is certainly not irrelevant. Plantinga points to beliefs that are false, but the actions they produce are still related to their content(or at least that is the case in the main line of attack I'm concerned with). If you want to argue that content is not relevant to the link between belief and action that's a separate debate, but Plantinga is not arguing that, but simply arguing that the truth value of that content does not in itself determine that.

My counter argument is that beliefs are not selected one at a time, and we have to think about  the mechanism that would generate these beliefs. 

In order to generate multiple useful beliefs throughout a lifetime, and be selected for, this mechanism must have certain properties. 

1) It has to create beliefs where the semantic content produces the correct action. 

2) It has to do so based on many diverse sources of input, and in many different situations. 

A true belief generating mechanism would do this almost by definition, because actual knowledge of how the world works, plus a desire to achieve some action will *almost always* improve results. 

A false belief generating mechanism is inherently less likely to be so successful. Because its beliefs are largely false, it is constrained, from the outset, to not consistently map like situations to like beliefs. 

This claim probably merits a more thorough defense. When I say mapping like situations to like beliefs I mean mapping similar inputs to similar outputs. One example Plantinga proposes, that I am stealing from somebody else in these comments, is a belief that ""running from a lion is the best way to pet it"" paired with the desire to pet a lion. The problem though, is that having this belief means one of two things for the mechanism to be useful. The first is that the mapping from input to belief must not depend on physical reality in a meaningful way. The relevant physical situation here is proximity. I want to pet a lion, and I need to get close to it to do so. I think moving away would help that. In order to not also think that moving away from food will help me get closer, the mechanism must be inconsistent with respect to the actual physical situation. Given this, there is no reason to think that such a mechanism would consistently produce beliefs that are useful. The correct action *is* related in some way to the physical situation in which the governing belief applies, and so we must just suppose that this mechanism happens to get everything right, despite the fact that we now have good reason to think that the beliefs it generates *would not be meaningfully linked to the physical properties relevant to the success of our actions.*

Alternatively, the false belief producing mechanism can be consistent. I could think that getting closer to food *does* require me to run away. In this case, in order to have successful results my desires must be inconcistent. I need to want to run away from food, and towards lions. But this is not how humans operate and as best we can tell not how animals we observe behave, so this evolutionary history can be plausible in theory without Plantinga's argument being effective against naturalists, who do not think they are the product of such an evolutionary history.",philosophy,0

I did martial arts for a while, and in doing so my body was taught a lot of reflexes that are now what we would call muscle memory. If they are triggered my body goes into the right stances and steps automatically, however,  I feel it happen, I feel my arms move, I feel the sensation of danger, I am aware of my mind seeking threats. Though the action is reflexive, I am aware every step of the way. 

The one time in my life that I can remeber losing that awareness was when I was briefly knocked unconscious, even in sleep I have some sensation of my mind functioning in all times I can remeber, but that solid black spot in my memory was true lack of awareness. 

What you seem to be asserting is that to be aware you have to be capable of deep introspection, which is certainly something humans are capable of, but that is not what consciousness is. Consciousness is the awareness of experience and the knowledge of your own existence. I am not less conscious because I am reading a book, even though I am less aware of what is happening to my body while I am.

"&gt;If the equation shows that there are two possibilities, then why not assume that there are two possibilities?

Because equations are abstractions, not reality. Even in cases where math directly predicts outcomes (outside of theoretical physics), it would be unwise to confuse it with reality itself. This is the biggest failing of the human mind. We write down equations and decide that they must then somehow represent some kind of physical reality...just because. If I write an algorithm on a computer that allows for multiple outcomes to a given measurement, does that mean they all exist inside the computer somewhere? No. This is a real-world analogy. There is no real-world analogy or experimental example of even the possibility that more than one outcome exists at any given measurement instance, there is only a misguided physical interpretation of the abstract phenomena known as a ""superposition"". Only one outcome is ever observable, and all other outcomes do not ""exist"" out there somewhere in imaginary universes. 

Additionally, MWI claims to remove the ""conscious observer"" from QM, when in fact one of the tenets is that somehow a conscious observer magically becomes ""inextricably entangled"" with the experiment and the experimental result somehow, just by making a measurement. This seems to me a direct reference to consciousness being related or linked to measurement somehow. In fact MWI implies many things for consciousness itself including a splitting of consciousness into multiple branches of reality. It seems consciousness cannot be removed from MWI after all, a problem for any theory because experiments can be conducted without consciousness around. So the problem of what exactly is ""happening"" before measurement (i.e. the conscious observer becomes entangled with the measurement device, forcing one branch of the tree to actualize) becomes rather large. All in all it seems the many worlds interpretation has much to say about consciousness.

Finally, there is the difficulty of explaining delayed choice experiments in which the result at a detector may be decided long after a particle strikes it. Under MWI, when a particle strikes a detector, that result is set in stone, and also breaks entanglement. Therefore it should not depend on the later measurement.

MWI is untenable.",philosophy,0

Once Monday passes he realizes that there must be a flaw in his logic, but he knows Friday Thursday and Wednesday are out so it must be Tuesday. Repeat through Friday. Every day he concludes that it will be today and the judge will not be able to surprise him. Of course if he figures this out beforehand he's in trouble.

Secondly, he talks about the priority of existence to essence. In an analysis of Dasein, prior to ever coming up with some formula of how Dasein should act to one another, the basic groundwork for ""what is Dasein"" must be laid out.

An Immovable Mover must be Omnipotent, because without Omnipotence, something could not be made from nothing.  And without Omniscience, that Omnipotence would be useless, and entirely unable to result in any sort of rational, ordered universe.  It would be an utter mess, if it existed at all.

"We're nowhere near building self-aware AI, and therefore it will never happen...I think that's a specious argument.

As for our clever theories being useless, it's not entirely true. For example, programming languages like Java do huge amounts to abstract away the computer underneath. I can write a Java program and it will work on an x86, x86_64, ARM, MIPS, whatever processor with no changes. In theory, it would be impossible to tell what processor your Java program is running on (ignore the obvious out here that Java provides functions to let you ask)....you can still figure it out. Certain instruction sequences are slower than others on certain processors. You can run things and see how long they take, and get a good guess.

My point here is that even though it's hidden from the program, artifacts do shine through. It's possible that the Universe is a simulation and no artifacts will shine through and we'll never be able to tell...but not necessarily. Large scale anisotropies aligned along a three-dimensional grid would, for example, be pretty strong evidence of a simulation (not conclusive, of course, but if we want to argue that we will very rapidly fall into solipsism).",philosophy,0

2.  Individual species themselves have intrinsic value which requires preservation.

&gt; This would be analogous to taking the Fourier Transform of a fundamentally non-sinusoidal function.

This just seems to be a case of extending the analogy *too far*. Why would the analogous ""conversion mechanism"" require anything about going from a finite to infinite description such as in the case with the Fourier Transform?

"&gt; I also think it is definitely possible to argue that garnering true belief would be a supremely useful tool in survival. For instance, a creature able to accurately observe the world would be able to avoid predation, gather and hunt food, create tools etc.

As I understand it (I haven't yet watched the video, but I think I am familiar with the general argument), Plantinga is simply saying that evolution has no reason to select for the ability to have true beliefs. 

A creature with the ability to accurately perceive the world and the will to survive would likely survive and have the chance to pass on its genes, therefore making it an evolutionary success. 

On the other hand, a creature with the desire to die, and the ability to perceive all things as having the opposite of their actual ability to sustain life (seeing nutritious food as poisonous, seeing predators as helpful towards survival, etc.) would be just as likely to survive and be able to pass on its genes, making it another evolutionary success without its having many, if any, true beliefs. 

We can construct other examples, but the point is that if evolution were true it would give us no reason to accept the fact that we have any justified true beliefs, including our beliefs about the truth of evolution. because of this, a belief about the truth of evolution would be self-defeating.

Edit: Evolution only selects for the ability to survive and reproduce. We can imagine instances where the ability to survive and reproduce seems (at the very least) not very much less likely with false beliefs than true beliefs. Therefore, if we believe in evolution, we must find a way to show that true beliefs are in fact more conducive to survival and reproduction, or we must accept that we have no justification for our beliefs.
