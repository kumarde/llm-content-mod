"Why aren't we considering UCF,  USF,  FSU and SDSU?  Imagine if we actively recruited those two states.   I:m guessing that 3% could much higher if we could pull a few away from WSU,  OSU, CU,  UU and the MWC.  We could even pull recruits that Cal. and Stanford can't admit.  WVU is never going to recruit Texas or California so give us a flag to plant in FL where we have three current staff members recruiting as well as several ex players who coach there.  OU, OSU,  KU,  KSU,  TT,  and TCU should be all over Cali with its 300 D1 recruits.  A game in Cali every year for the 5 non Texas schools and a game every year in FL for WVU and the Texas 4 can't hurt recruiting. 6 division games, 1 rival, 2 cross division games means WVU would go to SD or Fresno 2 out of 6 years as would UCF and USF. Add Colorado State and Cincy/UNLV/ECU/UConn (depending on how you want the pods to look) and we can go to pods. 3 games in pods, 4 games in rotating divisions and 1 rotating cross rival for 8 games, the CCG (13th data point). You still play every twice every six years.  The ACC is secure now.  That pipe dream is dead.  With UCF and USF,  we get Orlando and Tampa bowls (we already have the Russell) with the Outback,  Citrus,  St.  Petersburg,  the Cure.   We could try and land the Holiday Bowl and/or Poinsetta in consideration for adding San Diego State.

while msu hasn't lost any recruits yet to decommitment, they've lost out on several recruits that they were previously favored to land, and going 3-9 and announcing no changes is likely to only add to that.  in state, Michigan is absolutely destroying msu in recruiting, though watch dpj go msu tonight just to make me look like more of a dickhead.

... but you are perfectly OK with Florida having to do all of those things. That is the definition of bias.

The Bushwackers burned down Lawrence (twice, I believe) and were the reason the first official state capitol had to be housed at Ft. Riley as Lecompton was heavily influenced by Missourians and susceptible to Missouri raids over the border.  Jayhawkers and Redlegs burned down a good bit of Osage County, Missouri as well.

Take away helmets and pads. I know what you're thinking - but nuckeyebut, those are there to protect the players.

If we take out the pads, the players will be more cautious when it comes to tackling because they are have to protect themselves.

But either way, glorifying Kaepernick isn't what we should be doing here. As far as the people who dismiss the issue because of stuff he did after the fact - that's on them. Those people need to grow up and look past Kaepernick the person, and understand the problem he and others are trying to address. That quote about how ""small minds discuss people, great minds discuss ideas"" is insanely pretentious, but it's kind of valid in this case.
