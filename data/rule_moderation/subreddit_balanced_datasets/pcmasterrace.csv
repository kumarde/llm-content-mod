"     _________________________________________________________________________________
    / I'd just like to interject for moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in  \
    | fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux |
    | is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a  |
    | fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities   |
    | and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.           |
    |                                                                                 |
    | Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without |
    | realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is    |
    | widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware    |
    | that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.              |
    |                                                                                 |
    | There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part   |
    | of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that     |
    | allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The       |
    | kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it   |
    | can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is       |
    | normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is |
    | basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux           |
    \ distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!                            /

"Peasants do what they're told. Peasants enjoy what they're told to enjoy. Peasants spend what they're told to spend. They're born in small shitty huts and they die in small shitty huts, with the life in between just a blur of horse shit, piss-laden streets, and mounds of undone work every day.

Console gamers are peasants because they believe whatever nonsense the biggest console and console supportive companies tell them. They accept at face value outright bullshit science about the human eyes, or what technology is capable of, or what values are worth what prices. The big companies take them by the hands, lead them to pasture, and feed them a carefully balanced diet of cheap mill runoff grain and slop oats. They buy a console at a set price, with low-end equipment optimized like a whore to work moderately well... and this they call the good life.

A typical peasant--not a console *gamer*, that may be a victim in this, a stooge for companies that want to suck the life and money from everyone, or just a blameless entry-level player satisfied with what they have... no, not these, but an actual Micro-suffering peasant nursing everyday on the teats of the big three as if it were ambrosia, will tell you that this is how gaming was meant to be. Buy console A, or maybe console B. Enjoy your deterministic prices, your Big Brother monitored sales, your 'landlord fee' online gaming rental, and your limited title selection.

""It's okay 'bout me not makin' any profit off of me own cows,"" a peasant will say, ""m'lord will provide. I has me a place t'sleep and a bed what's not the ground, so all is well.""

""Don't mind none gettin' sick. Tis a fair development in modrun society what with houses and diseases and whatnot. But couldn't of done better meself livin' any other way.""

""The lord can do me waif the first night o' me living with her in our tiny house, not a problem. He's the lord, after all. Maybe I'll be blessed and one o his kids'll pop out the wimmin's lowers what can fetch me a pretty parcel!""

You accept what they give you. You defend it because it's right. And you never question. That's a peasant's life.

But PC gaming? It starts cheap, and gets expensive quick. However, that's not the point. *Everyone* likes a sale, *everyone* likes cheap games, *everyone* likes value. But just because you save more on PC gaming, just because what you *decide* to spend gets you more, doesn't mean you're being *forced* to pick at value.

Because that's the difference in PC gaming and consoles, at the end of the day. Not the graphics or the framerate, the resolution, load times, game selection, portability, or even the community. It's making the decisions yourself.

"I actually have the MSI GE62VR (updated with 1060) right now. Your price point is actually a small problem as you can get ehh 970M laptops or good 960M laptops, but not 1060. The sweet spot for laptops is around $1200-1300, unfortunately. 

Here's what I think: If you don't need the 970M, don't get the GE62. The old version that you're looking at has worse cooling and build quality than their updated GE62VR. Unfortunately the one you linked is about the only half-decent 970m laptop. 

What games do you play? How long are you planning to keep this laptop before upgrading? You said you had a desktop, so you can probably mostly game on that. Because the laptop won't actually be used that much, the GE62 (second one) is probably your best bet, unless you can find a stellar deal.

"Okay, so people are afraid of scary-looking links. That's one step closer to safety, but before getting any more false positives, could we just learn how the domain system works?

It's the end of the domain that matters. `i.imgur.com` is a *subdomain* of `imgur.com`, in the domain system it's inside the authority of `.imgur.com` If you got something like `scam.facebook.com` or `scary.random.facebook.com`, you're still safe. You should only be afraid of `facebook.com.scary.random.com`, `facebook.scam.com` and `scamfacebook.com`, because they do not end to `.facebook.com`. (Actually, all domains start with a dot, it's just ommited in most cases.)

If you are on an external domain (like `messenger.com` to stick with Facebook for now), check the HTTPS signature. It should always have a company name in that, and unless you (or your sysadmin) installed malicious root certificates, it doesn't lie. Click on the little ⓘ or 🔒 before https://, go into the details of the connection being private or not, and there will be a ""view certificate"" button that also shows the organization the certificate was issued to.

In the case of The Witcher 3, quite a bit of the DLC was free (except the two expansions mentioned above) and the developer, CDPR, has said [there will be no other DLC.](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/157658/20160511/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-will-receive-no-more-content-after-blood-and-wine-dlc.htm)

"A little background on this build. I've been running most games on my HP Envy with nothing but Intel Onboard Graphcis and an i7 Processor, it's done great for me but as a Mechanical Engineering Major it couldn't handle modeling programs very well. I decided to buy the parts and assemble this build as a present to myself for my birthday in early August in order to be able to run any games I want, my engineering programs, and perhaps VR in the future.

I have yet to purchase a monitor due to time constraints and lack of need, however, I'm sure a lot of you would cringe to hear that despite my projector's ability to do 1080i I am currently using a screen resolution of 1366x768 to fit the picture on my ""screen."" Not to mention, due to the resolution I literally have not had the fans kick on on my 1070. I'm pretty sure I've insulted it. They spin up when I power everything on, but after that, nothing.

Cable managment is virtually non-existent in this case, but I love the versatility of it so I can live with stuffing all the wires in the dark crevaces.

I directly purchased all the parts from Micro Center, which I am lucky enough to have about an hour from my house. After rebates and deals the build cost me approximately $1225.

In the US, employees can't try to physically stop a thief because the loss of merchandise is cheaper than the lawsuit the store is afraid of.

"For furniture, IKEA has pretty much everything. My chair and desk are from them. Your PC relies mostly on your monitor. At 1080p 60Hz, you'll need about a $700 ish PC with a GTX 1060. If you want to do 1440P 144Hz or ultrawide 1440P. Then you'll need to get a GTX 1070 or GTX 1080 which the total PC would cost about $1200 to $1800. My general rule is for the GPU to be a third of the cost. So pick your GPU and monitor. Take the GPU then multiply about 3 times that. Then get someone to put together a parts list for that amount with that GPU. I'm a big fan of 144Hz and G-Sync if you want something nice. IPS and 1440P are also good luxury features for a monitor. 

So bare minimum. PC would be about $500-$700 for something decent. $200 or so for a monitor. About $40-$60 for a desk. $60 for a chair. Then say $100-$200 for mouse, keyboard, headset and mouse mat. Total cost would be a little under $1000 per setup for a simple 1080P 60Hz single monitor with a basic chair.",pcmasterrace,0
