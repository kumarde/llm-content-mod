anyway, back to this. i'm not even kidding, this is fucking brilliant.

in a thread *about* grammar, in the middle of some sort of elitist ""look at us we're punctuation masterrace"" clustersuck, someone decides to bypass banal and deconstruct the binary, showing how the oxford comma can lead to ambiguity (it can't, his example's stupid, but nevermind that, that's not the awesome thing that happened), someone -- one of those aforementioned assholes -- corrects him but can't differentiate between ""your"" and ""you're"".

It's pointless, u can't force somebody to open their wallet and they can just lie to u.  It's not ur job,  and any reasonable person would assume everybody in a charter fishing boat participating in a fishing tournament has their license. Any reasonable person, with all the excitement, would have a million things running thru his mind, the last thing anybody would do is check if a random deck hand had a $5 fishing license in his pocket. Third, the most important thing is the guy who caught the fish had his license.  He did absolutely nothing wrong, he didn't break any tournament rules or any fishing regulations, yet he's out almost a million. This seems more like the tournament organizers using it as an excuse to pocket the mil for themselves. If they care so much about licenses, they could have easily with the state issued exemptions or temp. blanket licenses for all participants. Some thing smells fishy in N.

"One good sign of a dumb cunt is when their idiocy is pointed out to them they start replying twice to the same post. Check. Then they switch from the topic at hand and instead start desperately grasping around for supposed and imagined ""insults"" that, if they had a brain they'd realise are actually complements. Check. They typically start referring to themselves in the plural as though they are some kind of representative of a crowd of similar minded dumb cunts. Check. The imaginary audience created in their own mind.

You've got it bad. Every trait of the dumb cunt all in the space of a few posts.

What exactly in your tiny, dumb brain do you imagine is wrong with being a child? Eh? It's the most moronic feeble attempt at an insult imaginable.

I'd take being me at 3 years old over being you at any age.  Because you are a dumb cunt. You were a dumb cunt when you were younger, and you will always be a dumb cunt.

"Hello fellow fake sounding number owner! I'm in the same boat here (think 555-5551) and the amount of idiots who use my number online is insane... almost as bad as having to say ""Yes that's my real number. Yes, I'm sure it's not fake, really... really"" every time I have to give my number out. 

The worst case of this happened to me a couple years ago, for about 3 months I kept receiving phone calls from car dealerships in my area asking for 'Jane Doe'. I was getting multiple calls per day, some days as many as 12 calls, at pretty much all hours, always asking for Jane Doe to tell her about the new offers on a Kia Soul in my town! I kept blocking the numbers and asking to be taken off the list but the calls kept pouring in. After 2 months I was going crazy, and then one day at 8 am I get a call from a saint, he asks ""Is this Jane Doe?"" ughhh not this again, I politely explain the situation and he just kind of sits there for a second ""Are you SURE this isn't Jane Doe?"" of course I'm fucking sure. ""So you're not [reads off my mom's email address]?"" I sat there blinking stupidly for a full twenty seconds before I hung up the phone. And that's the story about the only time I ever screamed at my mother. Now she knows if she ever uses my number again I will post her number online begging for the nastiest stuff the internet has to offer via text message.

Also, If Cesar from Shawnee Mission Kia is miraculously reading this; Sorry for hanging up on you. I called back a week or two after this and said lots of good things about your spectacular customer service.",funny,0

My wife has decided not to carry her purse, so I also have her checkbook/card thing that she's crammed in three dozen reward cards she always for gets to use.  It also has dozens of punch cards from three or four places.  She keeps getting new ones because she can't find her old ones in this mess.

He used to have an Italian accent [2], hinting at Italian heritage, though a police background check run by Homer reveals his real first name to be Mohammar [3]. In the episode entitled ""Lisa Goes Gaga,"" Moe said that he was ""Half monster, half Armenian."" It is further referenced in the episode ""Moe Goes from Rags to Riches"" his father is the yeti that lives on Mt. Everest.
