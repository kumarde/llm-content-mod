If you say that meds and therapy are not an option, maybe you could start researching this connection, and ways to treat it.

It may sound ridiculous but you are the only one stopping you from goals and dreams. Reflect on your whole life and really find out what makes you happy. You sound very young so you are not giving yourself the building blocks you need to make positive decisions in your life. My suggestion is to read. Go to the library and find out what interests you, even if it's death. There WILL be something in there that you will not be able to put down. Research everything on the subject that interests you the most. You won't be able to do that in death.

"I don't why so many people think highschool were the best years of their life. Most people I know hated it(including me). It wasn't until post college that I really got to become myself and enjoy life. I moved away to go to college. It ended up not working. Moved to a new state for a few year, got a DUI. Move again to another state when I now have a killer career and awesome life. Everything post highschool really shaped who I am now and I wouldn't change anything(including the DUI!).

">regret

Our lives are a series of choices, with possibilities branching off in multiple directions for each choice. If we could see it from a distance, it would look like a great tree; a natural fractal. 

You will have many options in your life. Some won't turn out the way you wish they had. You will wonder how things could have turned out - but doing this achieves nothing except making you sad and burning brain runtime cycles needlessly. 

A quote that helped me with this was:

""Don't waste your precious time pining for a future that couldn't exist from a past that didn't happen.""

Where you are, what you're dealing with - is happening. And from there you have choices, directions in which to apply yourself. 

Living with your choices is just part of life. Noone makes all good ones. Noone escapes that after the fact doubt. But the happiest are those that accept that it happened, let go of the suffering, and move *forward* having salvaged a lesson learned from the mistake. 

>good paying job difficult

It is. Sorry sunshine, but that's life too. 99% of all humans that ever lived had to do some job they'd rather not have been doing. It sucks, but Newton's First Law of Thermodynamics will not be denied. Take heart, *everyone* is in this same boat, and we live in dire times. 

We don't choose the circumstances we are born into; we can only lay down and die, or make the best of them. Honestly your best bet is a practical trade in demand. There's nothing wrong with honest work, and owning your own business brings a lot of freedom and prosperity. A good goal to work toward, starting by acquiring and building a practical skillset. 

>Gym

All of that is easy. There are great resources like 4chan's /fit/ and /r/fitness. 

I'll say this. Getting to where you can work out is 99% overcoming fear, 1% work. Its super easy to see your fears - I dont have a gym, a routine, knowledge of the machines, how long, etc - as this big, oblique obstacles that pose unknown threat. 

In reality, its as easy or as hard as you want it to be. It's all about finding the knowledge to ward away that 'fog of fear'

There's some great information on the sidebar of /r/theredpill as well. Believe me, personal fitness - especially lifting, for guys - is an investment that will bring you incredible returns. You simply feel better, seeing the strength and attractiveness bloom in your body, relative to the work and time you're willing to put into it. 

A lot of guys recommend programs like Starting Strength & StrongLifts 5x5. 

Otherwise, a lot of the time gyms will offer tutorials for newcomers. Don't be afraid. Everyone at the gym is there for their own work and does not give a fuck about you. Think about how often you think about or judge others, and realize all of them are the same. One of the great returns on the investment of lifting is that you become a lot more comfortable in social circumstances - being around people. It takes time, and a will to keep at it - but it comes.

PM me any time bud. We men live in desperate times these days. Much of what we suffer is engineered and a deliberate attempt to drive good men to kill themselves. This world needs all the good men it can get.

"Hi, you found your way to this sub for the Reddit community/family to see your post, and they have--I have. You're a part of this community just by sharing what you're going through and the community has people who want to listen to you and want to help you. 

We're all just humans, every one of us flawed, and we're all in this whole thing together. Anyone who tries to help you is likely trying in the best way they know how. And that's really all we can do--try to help others the best we can.

I'm sorry you're going through this, and I hope you have already read the ""i"" information for this subreddit that the moderators have carefully and thoughtfully put together for you. They have resources listed there that very well may help you, so I hope you will take a close look.

I don't have any specific answer or advice for you myself, but if you want to add or share some more of what you're feeling right now I will surely read it, and perhaps others will as well.

Everyone has pain and hardships, they are different for everyone, and two people can be affected in completely different ways by the exact same thing. 

With every pain and hardship I've ever had, some passed with time, some I fiigured out myself, some I needed a lot of help with, and some I'm still dealing with. Some were out of my control, many were simply my idea of them as being a problem when they shouldn't have been. This will apply to the ones I'm experiencing today and the ones that will come my way tomorrow.

I only mention this as a reminder that you might understand this as being true for yourself as well. The reason I sent you this message is after reading what you're going through I believe this is the time you need to reach out beyond this thread and get yourself some more (or different) direct help. The resources are there, so I really hope you consider doing this right away.

I truly hope you find the strength, wisdom, and courage you need to do the right things for yourself.

I know this may sound risky, but your better off not mentioning your suicidal thoughts to anyone unless you feel like your actually going to act on them. 

 Other people don't understand what it's like to have these thoughts, so they naturally overreact, and they offer little to no advice.  There's really no way to articulate your thoughts to another person without them panicking.  So what you're experiencing is normal and to be expected.

"Whoa. I don't think life is precious and I don't think that getting down on yourself every once and a while is unnatural. Life is just life. We're all just meat. No different than a turtle or a kitten really. However, the world we live in isn't much different than a painting or a piece of poetry. 

---

But thats the crux of it isn't it? When I see a kitten I don't want it to die. And I don't want you to die either. Just because I don't think life is sacred doesn't mean that I can't appreciate life. Its that whole empathy thing we have wired into us. If you're in pain, I want to help you have less pain. If you're going to kill yourself, I'd rather stop you because there is something different that happens every day that is entirely unique and beautiful. Something you've seen with your eyes that I may not be able to understand without your help. 

If the world is art, we need as many interpretations of that artwork so that we can better understand it. I look at a jackson pollock and see waves of emotion. Unrestrained creativity being let loose. Maybe you see the same painting and think ""anyone could do this."" Maybe it reminds you of something cute, or morbid. Maybe it sparks a memory from what you've experienced. You might hold some kernel of depth that you don't even know because you've not had the chance to explain the world, the painting you see, in a way that people can understand.

I came on here looking for some one to try and talk to and that person is you my friend.  I have been through the bankruptcy process and believe me it is a pain in the ass.  BUT, I will tell you from experience, there is always a solution to financial difficulty.  I would very strongly suggest you Google bankruptcy trustees in your area and go for a credit counseling session.  They will help you see all sorts of different ways to consolidate your debt and you may not even have to go through the bankruptcy process.  You could be back on your feet at ground zero within three years.  My friend, my friend, what a bloody shame it would be if you died for some faceless banker.  If you were snuffed out like that.  You know, the sun is out today, it rained last night.  This morning nature is renewing itself.  The birds are singing that the sun had come out.  Please, for my peace of mind, write down a list of your financial stressors and then go for a walk this evening.  Leave that list on the table and it is not allowed to come with you on your walk.

I think by the weekend, if you are able to get outside a little, you may just start to see a light at the end of the tunnel.

I've had one suicide attempt that led to a coma five years ago. My last attempt was a few months ago...(I called 911 so they could come before I took the 200-300 prescription pills I had.)

"It would be for your own wellbeing if it came to that. Understand that people want to help you. We're all in this  strange boat we call life and nobody wants to see you suffer. I was having thoughts about suicide about a month ago and I was truly considering it. I've dealt with the feeling of worthlessness  for more than half of my life. It's those rare good times in life that keep me hopeful. If you were happy at least once in your life you can achieve that again. No matter what happens you can bounce back with the right mindset. You have to fight back against the emotional fog that clouds your judgment though. Do whatever you have to do to control your emotions. You could start with that hotline or you could see a psychologist   and/or psychiatrist. For me smoking cannabis is a God send. Open up to someone, that's the first step to making a big difference. It will hold you accountable for your actions and allow a different perspective to your reasoning. ",SuicideWatch,1

"In your words I hear a strength. At least, to me, dreaming of living in another country one day, is a strength. 

There is a tangible tug of war within your words. A young person torn between their dreams and the realities of the world around them. So many of us are stuck building a path for ourselves. Unwilling or unable to shed our skins. 

I have also worried, well, pretty much all of that stuff. One day I just sort of decided, you know what? Fuck it. I don't think I'll have a GF? Fuck it. If that's how it turns out, fine. But I have to stop telling myself. Is it true? Maybe. But if I keep telling myself, what am I doing other than torturing myself and closing myself off?

But that's what I did. The question is what are you going to do? Are you going to challenge your brain and your fears? 

If your solution is harming yourself, and if this is something you think about often, I hope you talk to a medical professional about it.

Have you ever spoken with a parent or relative, maybe a friend, about these feelings? 

Does it surprise you that many young men and women feel this way? For these feelings to reach a point of driving you to want to harm yourself, is dangerous. It's not to be minimized or discounted.

The alternative to harming yourself is not what you have described for yourself. It never will be. However you can keep telling yourself that it will be, and it will never change. Or you can just try to get to the root of it, and wipe it clean. Easier said than done. Have you ever spoken with a therapist? Are you often thinking about solutions or are you still stuck on what the problems are? To reflect on these matters might be of help to you. 

But really I am just glad you came to SW and said something. You know something is wrong, and you don't want it to be so morbid. I want you to know change is possible. And that it's alright to feel this way... many do, and its important that they are managing themselves appropriately. 

Speaking to a medical professional was the first act of change that I made. It may not be yours. But in my opinion, everyone struggling has that wide open chance to make a change. Every day is a different day. It's our actions that make them feel the same. 

You say you know yourself, but there is so much more for you to see. So much more to share with the world. Do you really know yourself? Or are you busy hating a shadow of yourself that you have grown used to following you? You can lose the shadow. Maybe coming here and posting was one of the first steps to self-actualizing a better future. 

It breaks my heart to hear you say that you will never have a friend, when you have probably been a friend to so many. Companionship is a fickle thing and it takes many years to master. 

I have posted here on SW and in my time of trouble, I wasn't happy when someone said PM me anytime.

"I know this comment is long, but please take the time to read through it. 

I seriously relate to what you're saying in your OP. It's difficult to to realize what we have when we have it. People always say you miss things when you don't have them anymore, and that might be true to some degree. Do you think your parents would feel relief if you ended your life? What about everyone that knew you past ""hello""? What about people that you have impacted positively, do you think they'll feel some sort of relief that you are no longer living? I think it's fair to say that some people don't care about you, but it's just as fair to say that some people do care about you. 

To me, lying is a big issue. It's always important to be honest, but sometimes we can't always be honest. Lies happen, and will keep happening. The very important part here, that you seem to have down, is that you already recognize you lie. This is a really good first  that you already past to help you, if not stop lying, but to limit it and actively try to reduce it. Basically, once you realize you're about to start a brand new lie, try to reduce the light, or at least don't give definitive information that puts you in the lie. 

Another important thing to realize is that the lies of the past don't have to control the lies of the future. Just because you lied about something, that doesn't mean you HAVE to lie about it in the future. This is an essential realization to have when you want to limit the amount of lies you tell. 

As for motivation, let me tell you this. I'm speaking from experience, and while I'm not in your situation 100%, I can relate. Motivation in and of itself FADES in comparison to discipline. Here's what the two words mean from a quick Google search. 

Motivation: The general desire or willingness of someone to do something.

Discipline: The practice of training people to obey rules or a code of behavior, using punishment to correct disobedience.

Motivation is having a desire to do something, whereas discipline is practicing or training to obey your own code of behavior. This tells me that motivation is a simple DESIRE that gets you going. You want to see the new movie, so you have a desire to get up and go see it. Well, what if you absolutely needed to watch that movie (say for a school assignment) and you don't have the desire to watch it. 

Discipline comes into play then. After a while, your desires will disappear or become weak. Discipline is the thing you can use to KEEP going, even though you don't feel like it. If you are too tired or too sleepy, you still get your homework done. If you are too comfortable in your chair, or feeling too lazy, you still get up and exercise. 

You mentioned you tried to reinvent yourself eight times and nothing worked. Think of it this way instead: It's not that you're reinventing yourself, it's more like you are discovering yourself. We reach stages in our lives, and each new stage we come across, we explore it, see what we like and what we don't like, and make ourselves familiar with it. 

Try to become familiar with yourself. Try to explore your mind, see what works and what doesn't, within yourself. This is easier said than done of course, but a good way to do that is to meditate. Sit comfortably somewhere, focus on your breath, and see what happens. Another way I like is to just sit with your own thoughts for good periods of time. No phone, no computer, no music. 

As for your last point, I cannot tell you why you should not suicide. That is for you to ask yourself, for you to explore, for you to learn, for you to find out. It sucks when everyone around you is shitty, that's the hand life dealt you. You can look into moving out, if you're of age. If not, what you are doing on reddit here is good to help you get past these shit moments in your life.

I know you have probably tried many times. I know I had, during the days where I said that I didn't see myself getting any better. Slowly I was able to shape what getting better really meant. And suddenly it became manageable.

"Suicide isn't illegal in most countries. In the countries that it is, I think attempting suicide is a crime, like attempted murder, which sounds crazy to me. I think it's a crime to kill someone else, or to tell someone else to kill themselves, no one has the right to do that. Euthanasia is a complicated issue but I believe it should be allowed in some cases. But it's not simple, it's a complex issue. Sometimes people get better when there was no hope.

IT DOES GET BETTER.....PLEASE READ

Is there no one like family wise or anything you could live with? Im in a very similar position but my parents (who o would be dead without) hve let me stay with them and understand my social anxiety etc. What i have found is that after a year of trying, things are getting better. I found ana amazing understanding therapist, and am now even dating someone! (Im 33m) i have spent over a year of my life in hospitals due to crohns/arthritis/depression/addiction etc. I grew up with 2 diblings in a 2 bedroom apt with my mom who barely had a high school education. Just recently her and my step dad took iver a family business and are doing really well. Im very fortunate to have that, and without that one thing i wouldnt be here. 

You need to find a place where you can do this. Unfortunately.for you that means you are going to have to suck it up a litle bit. Your choices are that, or death. Its that simple? Im all for one having thr right to choose, but you must also consider the reality of tour situation and the world you live in. We are weird to most others, and this wirld is not built for us. The only way around that is sucking it up enough to gain the ability to build the realoty you want. Do you want to be a recluse and spend all of your time alone? Learn a skill that lets you work from home, or run your own business. You have to give a littlw to get what you what undortunately.

I have realized i cant work with other again. So i found some space to build a wood shop, and am currently starting my iwn business so i am my boss and can work when i want.

You control every aspect of your life. You have to wake up every day and remind yourself that you are capable of doing anything you set your mind to. Not only that, you have to do it as well. It's hard; probably the hardest thing to do in life, but the reward is happiness.

Another thing I'd recommend is finding more constructive ways to relieve stress or fight bouts of depression. Self-harm is destructive, and leaves you feeling worthless. Be constructive; find something that you enjoy doing (maybe art, or music, etc) and use it as an outlet when you're feeling overwhelmed. No one can do it for you; you have to identify the negatives in your own life and eliminate them. I believe in you, and you should believe in yourself.

My suggestion is, follow the kid to school and see if he is alright. I see that it has been four hours since you've posted this so the kid should still be in school. Before you call CPS which might bring him even more stress in his voliatile state, have a chat with the kid.

I like to think that, we are always being secretly lead by some ""mysterious force"" to the best path in our life, and it's just society, merchandising etc. built a wrong perception of success in ourself. And it actually does!
From my experience ambition is the worst kind of parasite, and you will never get from it. You just need to push it into other section of your life.
Write out some things you would love to do in a future, and choose the ones that you are able to archive.
And the next one: YOU ARE NOT SUCK IN ANY COUNTRY. Maybe for 20 years you will live in australia, mexico or some african country. Maybe in some other city in your country that you will find beautiful.
After you will do all this stuff, just eat healthier, go run and meditate. Sleep less and turn youtube, open a book see some courses and work, work, work, work, work, work work. Funny tip, i had problems with math in highschool and i was even going back to really basic stuff from primary school, before learning the next one. Maybe you need to work on simple things, over and over and over. And remember the power of muscle memory in math. If its hurt, it mean you give some effort to it, and you shouldnt. If you will do at least 500 divide/multiply/subtract/adding cases, you will start making it without thinking.
ALSO learn to learn, turn on youtube/some courses. I know they dont learn it in school, but you should learn in internet. Its easier.",SuicideWatch,1

"Hun, experiencing the loss of someone to suicide can make you feel that you failed the person.  Someone who is apparently so close to you, that will hit you even harder.  You probably feel what's called ""survivors guilt"", where you feel like you should have been the one to die, rather than your friend.  It might be hard to admit that to yourself, if that's how you feel.

Your friends are probably feeling lost as well.  If this friend was their friend, it doesn't matter how tenous the connection, it's going to affect them to some degree.  Maybe not as hard as it hit you, but still.  **bold**I'm so incredibly proud of you though, for reaching out for help.**bold**  It's something that so few people actually do, because they feel like they have to deal with it alone, or they feel that they will be viewed differently for their feelings.

That being said, there are things to look into.  First, have you tried talking to an adult about your feelings?  A teacher, a counselor, clergy, parents?  They should get you some help, such as talking to a professional therapist.  You may need to look into medicine as well, because you may have a chemical imbalance.  You may need other treatments as well, but first thing first, talk to someone.  You can talk to me as well, PM me anytime.  I'll respond, even if it takes me a while.",SuicideWatch,1

"I researched several suicide methods, because I wanted to find out the ups and downs.  One thing that people don't usually understand is, killing yourself is hard, damn hard.  Pills, hanging, shooting yourself, there's NO method that is foolproof.  And most of them, if not all of them, have the potential to leave you fucked up worse than you were before the attempt, if you fail.  Most suicide attempts are just that, attempts, people fail or chicken out.  I definitely recommend chickening out.  You have fewer potential side effects from that then you do from trying and failing.  OP, you were lucky that you didn't end up back in the hospital.  And honestly, you may have caused long term or permanent damage to your system.  I hope you get checked out.  But thank you for posting this, it's the same with any method.

What I have learned is this. To make friends you need to go to a place regularly and meet with the same people regularly, if your nice you will form a friendship. Your connection is the event your at. Go to events, make friends, fake it till you make it. 

Piece of advice, get off Facebook, t.v. And Reddit. They are toxic things. Get out and get on meetup.com and go meet friends. It's what I did. Get on okcupid.com and get a girlfriend. You have to be somebody that people want to be around, so don't be a jerk. I am speaking from experience.

I have a feeling here the ribbing isn't as strong as you think it is. Regardless, your response should be one of power, not humiliation. Just tell them that you prefer the exercise.

Does that sound like bullshit? Because it was. Because most of the people who give you shit about not driving personally don't care themselves, and certainly don't care about you. They care about themselves and their own image: that is what they formulate when they socialize. They key here is not being the whipping boy and finding something in life you enjoy doing, and you getting older will take care of the rest.

It's no longer news that the Acquired immune deficiency syndrome /Human Immune Virus (HIV/AIDS) is increasing by the day. The fear is that many people living with the sickness are scared of saying it because of the stigma that comes along with it. I'm bold enough among many others to state that there is now a potent cure to this sickness but many are unaware of it because of the rate of scammers on the internet . I discovered that i was infected with the virus 11 months ago, after a medical check-up.  and i was shocked, confused and felt like my world has has come to an end, i was dying slowly due the announcement of my medical practitioner but he assured me that i could live a normal life if i take my medications (as there was no medically known cure to HIV). I did everything to get this disease cured but all prove abortive until i found Dr. Iyayi Waziri, a professor of infectious diseases at TSRI’s Florida campus, said he expects his new drug candidate could cure the 35 million people living with HIV worldwide within the next few years, so i got in touch with Dr. Iyayi Waziri who gave me his drugs that cured my HIV.

"Hey! Welcome to the you-definitely-have-depression club! We have cups of sadness and meet almost every day. The sadness will stay, but it's not as bad as you're trying your best to think. Depression compounds your problems and makes even things that would be considered insignificant seem incredibly devastating. You know that already, but think about it a little more. One early assignment in one class? You don't learn anything in life unless you occasionally fuck up, and this is an incredibly minuscule fuck up that isn't going to derail your life. If something that small can derail the path you set for yourself, then that metaphorical train wasn't worth the ride anyway. try an alternative route. Ask yourself, why am I depressed exactly? I don't mean mulling over the specific thoughts that are depressing you or why you're predisposed to depression, but why you are having those thoughts. What's the bigger picture? For me it was that I wasn't pursuing what I wanted to in college and that I felt as if I was leading a life based upon someone else's goals. I felt like I was a puppet and someone else had my controls. I felt lazy like you but I wasn't a horrible, lazy person, my passion just happened to be elsewhere. I simply wasn't motivated to work on something I didn't care about. Maybe your reason is different from mine, but think carefully about your purpose and what you want it to be. It is yours to control. 

Also, it's good you're looking into a therapist, but the solution will start and end with you and whether you're able to curve your perspective on the problem. Therapists can diagnose whether you have depression, but you don't need a quant to tell you 2+2=4. You already know the answers they'll give you. Therapists might give you a pity party but you don't need that. Antidepressants and other drugs the might prescribe are temporary solutions, but you'll find they too won't magically fix your depression.

I feel like you're also dealing with issues of anxiety. Everyone has a different solution, but I'd say what has helped me the most is travel and meditation. Travel and get lost. Struggle with something new! We weren't put on this Earth to be comfortable. After that, just lay down, put on some headphones, listen to a meditation video off youtube before bed, and clear out your mind. School makes you overthink your situation in the wrong way and sometimes you just *need* to clean up and get away. 

Your life isn't fucked. Far from it.

All of the routes are on a rating scale v0-10+ so you can easily track your progression.

It sucks that your girlfriend is putting you through this, but this provides you with an experience you never had.

I understand the thing about depression; when life seems to pile so many crappy things on it just seems easier to off yourself.

"Here's the full run down as I see it.

I have an autoimmune disorder that is called ankylosing spondylitis. Basically my own immune system is attacking the chronic pain and degeneration of my spine. But that's where the rabbit hole starts Alice, because we have so much further to fall. 

Aside from acute sciatic nerve pain running down my legs, and back pain daily, there is also the very real threat that my kidneys and liver may shut down as a result of the very immunosuppressants I have to inject once a week to treat it. I also meet all criteria at Duke medical's headache clinic for being a clinical trial patient for migraines. I get them every day. 

Severity varies. Some are annoying. Some make we roll around naked in the bathtub vomiting and praying to gods I don't believe in, to end my life. Begging for a moments respite, I would risk damnation among the stars. 

They are triggered by the degenerating disks in my neck pushing on the occipital nerves. It feels like a screw driver being shoved through your sinus and into your eye socket, then twisted up into your brain and down into the base of your cranium. Since the vascular structure is so close to the nerve, I get the added bonus of any increase in blood pressure feeling like a stabbing in line with my heart beat when it gets bad.

Real bad days? Those are ER visits where I get to shock nurses with my BP staying over 115 as they give me a third IV dose of IV dilauded, making people think I am some
sort of drug addict to be judged. No, just in  incomprehensible amounts of pain that are worse than a gunshot victim. 

Oh but it doesn't end there.

I have an undiagnosed movement disorder that causes myopathy, rapid onset fatigue, tremors, fasiculstions, and even spasms in random muscles all over. Again, severity varies. You can't tell most days from the outside, but most of the time I feel like I am touching a battery. It is sort of identity destroying to go from marathons and being a titan of a man as a marine to being a shell of that person unable to take up any of the activities that defined him. 

Two neuro teams, one at Vandy, one at Duke, and also a genetic disease specialist who mapped my human exome don't have any answers. Nothing points to why I went from triathlon to ""stairs are hard"", in 2 years. Hope is an ever receding form of tests that all come back normal.

So I'm a weak human tuning fork who feels like he's touching a battery with a bad back, mind number chronic pain, and on medication that could kill him. That's without the risk of overdose of narcotics that are taken just to keep me vertical. Which I am terrified of, because my mother was a pill head who beat me as a kid for hiding part of the house from her that she was too high to remember existed.

Oh, and I can't sleep. Maybe 12 hours a week on the average. It is literally stressing my body to the point of, oh goodness here it comes, ulcerative colitis and diverticulitis.

So now I get to pass out from abdominal pain on the regular without more medication to help manage it. I say manage because it is a tightrope. 

So that's just a nice little sugar on top of this fucked up layer cake.

Last, but certainly not least? I have been in every way imaginable, emotionally destroyed by someone who I would have sworn loved me till the moment she said she didn't. Which is understandable in a way. I mean, I hate me, so I get why others wouldn't want that kind of pancake stack of issues they didn't sign up for. 

So this recipe for total sanity begs the question;. What the fuck am I doing here?

i told them that i was suicidal because of a specific thing that happened and i was going to end it (which i should've never done), but i started calming down after i realized the gravity of what i said
but by that point it was already too late. i was trying to tell them not to do it because they 100% knew that if word about me being suicidal got to my mom, she'd take away everything, and that i had realized that and i had calmed down, but they didn't listen and messaged my boyfriend, who then told my mom /:

Is there any way you could reach out to one of your friends and explain to him/her how you really feel? The people we surround ourselves with really do help keep us afloat like you were saying, and if there is any way that you can still try to reach out to at least one of them and let them know how much they mean to you I think that would be immensely helpful.

Sorry to hear that you feel like a burden. That's tough to deal with, especially with people you really want to keep around. I really hope you can get just a little bit of hope to want to get better though. I think if you can tell yourself that you deserve to get better and feel happy, you don't have to be a burden. I hope that you can become someone that they really love and you can help keep them afloat.

It's unusual to think about but there are so many people in this world that it is easy to feel alone, but when we do connect with others we develop a mutual care because of that feeling.

You may not know me but I would consider you my friend because I care about you as a fellow human. We all feel trapped at times and what makes us stronger is lifting each other up to eventually feel free, and to be able to look back on the obstacles we overcame and feel proud that we really overcame them.

I hope you can have the same hope that I have that you can overcome this and get the happiness you deserve in life.

There needs to be a balance of certain things for people to achieve the happiness they want. There are different groups for every person by I grouped mine up at physical health(exercise, healthy diet), mental health(therapy, medicine if needed), and a social life. Some people add in financial gains or starting a family/love life but to each their own. I would recommend finding a group or club or anything to join because it's very important to keep active. Find some hobbies to occupy free time you have, even video games are good for your brain in reasonable doses, and if you get this feeling again, take a walk and look at the vast world around you. A nice walk will help stimulate your brain and even when I wasn't health obsessed, as I am now, a walk really helped me think things through and got me over some really tough things.

"Hi,

I am happy for you that you and your father have turned a new leaf.  your relationship has blossomed into real human emotion.  your dad is a human, trying his best. i hope you continue to venture into peace with him.

your mom is also a human.  she deserves respect. it will be hard, it will take time.  

the relationship between your mom and dad is as complicated as yours and your moms.  certain people remember scenarios different. different moments stick out in someones mind when they are were backstabbed, slighted, etc.  i'm sure at one point your parents were very much in love and sometimes things break down.
i'm sure your dad was guilty of some bad behavior with your mom as much as your mom was.  hopefully they have moved on also.

you have seen how wonderful a relationship can be when you get to know someone.  it is much better than fighting.  i hope you choose to work on your relationship with your mom --and try to connect with her new boyfriend who is trying to be pleasant to you.

"You are absolutely not a freak for being transgender. It's really rough when people reinforce that idea, but it is not true. The DSM-V replaced the term ""gender identity disorder"" with ""gender dysphoria"" specifically to remove the idea that the individual is disordered. Nothing is wrong with your gender identity, and nothing is wrong with trying to live to match it.

It's weird to me, the way our society insists that ""something to live for"" has to be big. It doesn't have to be something huge. It just has to matter to you. Is there a song you really love? Live for that. A story you love to hear? Live for that. Nothing is a stupid reason to stay alive.

I can't promise it will get better. You're right. But there really is a possibility it will, and dying removes that possibility entirely.

That job paid minimum wage. In that role I continued learning what I wanted to do. I used what I was learning to improve my entire teams productivity.

It definitely helps to be prepared, but until that baby is born (and generally a few months after) we have no clue the gravity of the situation we are about to be in. You learn as you go.

It'll be possible to be a student and eventually a teacher with a baby. It won't be easy, but it's certainly doable. You'll just need to realize that juggling your time between school and baby will leave you little time for yourself. While you may not be able to go out with your peers and party there will be exceptions, and after you're set in your career the things you'll be able to do will make all that sacrifice worth it.

It took years of therapy, and lord knows I have a ways to go, but I found the best revenge on these sick fuckers is to live...in defiance of them, what they did, and the power they think they hold over you.   God forbid I end up taking my life one day, but I damn sure am not doing it for that son of bitch.  I'm not giving him that kind of credit.  please, please, please reach out to someone.  It might be a good idea to contact someone outside of the church.  Get to a doctor (not affiliated with school or church) and get examined.  I know that it feels embarrassing and can ""reactivate"" the trauma, but it will help any case you end up building against this monster and you probably need medical treatment for the injuries you've suffered.  Odds are, you aren't the only one being abused like this and if you come forward (as hard as that may be), someone else might be spared once that creep is behind bars.  No pressure, though.  My rapist and molester went unreported, as many such offenders do, but it's entirely your decision.  I highly recommend, however, that you get out of that school and away from that church ASAP.  You don't need to suffer like this, and I really hope you decide to live.  Life isn't always peachy keen, but even with the lasting effects of the abuse I suffered in my own childhood, I've come to see that existing is beautiful.  The pain I feel at times make beauty all the more splendorous.  Mathew, I hope you get away from that sick bastard and get some help.  You are not worthless.  You are not a pathetic loser.  You are a human being that has been left in the care of a very, *very* sick man, and that is no fault of yours.

If I can only get the collection company to lift the holds by letting me make small payments. Then I have to pay DMV money and get my license back if I can because I I've already had 1 driving on suspended and had a car towed. The chp who pulled me over was very professional but did fuck me over.. I told him how I need to get in front of a judge and at least now I will be able to but then when I appeared at the court date they said the officer changed the ticket to just pay it and not have a court date.

"Definitely do some research on depression/suicide. I remember feeling a huge disconnect from my parents when I was 14, and although it must be the most daunting thing to experience as a parent, you gotta show her you'll support her. My parents didn't quite grasp the severity of mental illness (probably because they didn't know how to handle it), so let her know her mental health comes first.

School was also a huge stressor for me at that age; maybe discuss with your daughter about contacting the school and inquiring into their support structures for mental health issues. Stuff like counsellors, or interventions such as a a ten-minute rest if tests/exams get too overbearing, or the office of a favourite teacher she can go to at recess if she's feeling lonely can really make a difference. If your school has none (but regardless), get in contact with a child &amp; and adolescent psychologist and psychiatrist to discuss medication and therapy appointments. Best thing to do is have someone that can adequately talk through those negative thought patterns and such.

Also make sure tablets are out of reach. Self-harm is tricky, hopefully she'll talk to her psych about it (they'll ask). Look up the ""rubber band and ""ice"" methods (+ many, many more on the internet) to provide an alternative. Ice worked best for me.

Let her know she can always talk to you without refrain or your judgement, but as mentioned by /u/CentaurOfDoom, don't overly pressure her (I know there are so many fine lines...).

Good luck!! My best wishes for your family. I know this must be such a hard thing to approach... As I've gotten older I've begun to appreciate everything my parents had to go through when I was a teenager. Thank you for taking to time to gain some insight into this",SuicideWatch,0
"Be kind to yourself and be patient. It's great to read that you have been in contact with counselling lines and are trying medication. Meds can take a while to work and generally won't solve all the pain, I find anti-depressants to be more of a tool/ladder to lift you up a little while you climb your way out of a hole. 

Do you have a counsellor you can see on a regular basis? It can be beneficial to build a relationship with 1-2 professionals to help monitor your journey and equip you with other therapy tools to get you through this. 

I can relate to friends not understanding when a breakup causes/triggers so much lasting pain that it expands into a state of deep depression that requires extra support and treatment.",SuicideWatch,0
"Think about the pros and the cons of like living with your mum vs your dad. Is it better to live with anxiety contsantly, over not living with that but not having your resit? There are always, always other options. 

Your life will be different if you don't do the resits or exams but, that isn't to say it will be a bad different. I know what its like to put up with anxiety of being ridiculed and not understood, having to rely on someone so toxic for something you really do need and i do feel for you, but like I said there'd always another option. Also, you aren't a failure at all, GCSE'S are fucking hard, a levels are even fucking harder a d I failed all of mine but have still managed to get a good education in spite of that. 

Your mum sounds like some of my family members and I'm sorry they're like that, I know how angering and also depressing that can be.

Some people wants to prevent death because deaths, bullying and all that affects us all in one way or another. Some doesn't care about themselves but wants save/help others. There are bigger or smaller % of those who are saving others because otherwise they gonna lose something (shelter, comfortable life, someone they can drain, ect) and there another % of those who wants to die but at same time they wanna help and end their days/life/misery knowing they helped someone and that gives them peace.

What a lot of societies got in common is they are in fact afraid of death, they lack open mindness about it and many other topics and wants to prevent it, but often don't understand how things they do and say are counter productive or that they are one of reasons why people ends up dying in first place.

Something I don't know happened other than the friend continuing to interact with the people my friend didn't like, and when my friend said something about it. She apparently told them she doesn't wish to speak for 3 weeks- which I'm guessing is fair from my perspective because we all were getting exhausted with trying to avoid these people who interact with everyone we interact with and we have no quarrels with.

In my case, the bullying lessened once I got to high school. I remember, the night before my first day of freshman year, I stayed up all night sobbing. I was terrified that the bullying would continue. But now, I'm actually happy at school. Yes, the bullying is still going on, but it's lessening.

"I respect your love for your mother and your discipline, but honestly man - would your mom rather have you die or have you graduate without honors? Think about it, man... Just think about what I just said and try to put your pride and your fear of being a failure out of your head...

Life is so much more than school, seriously - don't lose touch with the fact that life is about love (for parents, siblings, partners, friends, etc.) and that money, grades, worldly wealth, etc. don't mean jack shit at the end of everything... 

What matters is your influence on our world - how much love you share with others, how much good you do in our society, the time you spend with the people that matter (your mother is definitely one of them by the way)...

I know you're in pain, and I feel for you, but don't you think the following line is pretty damn selfish?

&gt; Of course I know killing myself would break her heart too. But if I'm gonna end up breaking her heart either way, I'd rather not live to actually see it

You're saying that you'd rather have your mom lose her child in one of the worst ways possible than have her see you graduate without honors and disappoint her in a way that's absolutely incomparable to the disappointment and heartbreak that she'd feel if you killed yourself... 

Like I said earlier, I'm not trying to be rude because this is a rough situation, but honestly that's a horrible thing to consider... Your mom would never be the same if you killed yourself - maybe she'd even kill herself too, like many parents whose children killed themselves decide to do, as tragic as that is... 

Back when I was suicidal my dad saved my life by finding the receipt to the rope I bought and calling the cops... He told me after that happened in a letter that if I had killed myself he would have killed himself too...

That's the kind of pain your mother, who you love and respect so much by the sound of this post, would feel if you decided on suicide over this - over anything actually, but especially over this...

Do you want to disappoint your mother, actually scratch that - you probably wouldn't even disappoint her because you try your best and you love her so much that you'd rather die than disappoint her... don't you realize your heart and who you are, the relationship you have with your mother, that that's what matters? Not grades, at all... - do you want to do a bit worse than you were hoping, still graduate and ultimately become a success (btw, none of this will matter in five years and you'll still be making similar money to what you would be if you did graduate with honors) or do you want to throw away everything and hurt your mother so badly that she will never be the same person again for as long as she lives? 

Appreciate the things that matter, man... Your mother loves you, don't break her heart and kill her child over something as petty as graduating with honors... Over anything at all, but especially over this... 

Think about what I'm saying man, deep down I think you'll agree with what I wrote... I'm here for you if you want somebody to talk to and you need help with your problems or whatever, I'm not as harsh as this comment makes me seem - I just see what you don't see in regard to this situation and need to be blunt so you don't do anything horrible like what you talked about in this post...",SuicideWatch,0

Thank you for sharing your story.  It sounds like anyone living life as you have/are would have anxiety and struggle.  I suspect your grades suffered because all of your energy and focus was on the life of someone you care about.  I don't know if you have ever heard of the term co-dependant?  You need to take care of someone ...she needs to be taken care of.  It's a hard cycle to break.  My experience says that she might not be able to stay clean because you enable her (without knowing that is what you are doing).  Drugs cause life to spiral out of control.  Right now you need help and I am glad you are here to share your story.  I was co-dependant  and an enabler....so as much as I wanted him to be clean ...I wanted to take care of him...it felt rewarding.  But I realized that my life wasn't going to get better....I would have quit going to college because I felt like I had to have control over everything so that he would go back to his addiction.  I went to a support group for friends or families of addicts and it changes my life.  Once I recognized how I was codependent....i worked my way out of it....it is so hard without support. Your parents need to know so they can be there for you.  You are not a failure....you are human...you are a good person and capable of success....you just gotta get through this tough part.  I will bet that your story will help others not feel crazy or alone.  I just encourage you to focus on helping you...talk to an advisor at your college and let them know what is going on and they will give you support as well.  Hugs!!!,SuicideWatch,0

"Hello there friend. First of all, thanks for reaching ojut to us. This must be hard, but it's an important step. 

From what I gather, it all boils down to the fact that you believe your height has ruined the best relationship you ever could have had. Breaking up is tough man, there's no way around it. Specially when the other person is everything we want. But don't let that define your life.

There are several positive aspects you name about yourself. You are a loving person, you work hard, and the fact that you have great friends means that you are, in return, a great friend to them! 

Yes, sometimes life may not seem fair. In this case, you perceive your height as the ultimate flaw. But I encourage you not to let it define who you are. Let me repeat that: You are not your height. There are so many positive things inside you. Your height is just another feature. And even when you feel no one will ever be able to love you because of it, think about the fact that most people who are currently in your life and are having a positive impact, have always looked beyond it. 

Friend, even when it is easier said than done, try to look past your own height. You are much, much more than that. Good luck.",SuicideWatch,0

"Hi there, I'm so sorry you had to go through what you did, and that you are still going through it. It sounds like you've been a resource for your father since your mother's death, that can be a difficult burden to bear. I hope you have people in your life that you can turn to, or a program you can take advantage of. Please make sure you take care of yourself. 

In the past, when I've lost people I love, I always wonder if there was more I could do, and feel guilty about not being able to change things. I think we're all our harshest critics, and it seems like we have very high standards for ourselves. We convince ourselves that we would have been able to do something, if we had only tried harder. One thing that helped me a lot with feelings of guilt or blame over the years is an exercise a therapist had me do years ago. She asked me to put someone else in my place, to imagine that a friend or acquaintance was telling me about the situation, and to think about how I would judge them. Would I blame them, or expect more from them? In almost every case I could think of, I said of course not. My therapist asked, if your friends deserve compassion and kindness, why don't you? Why can you forgive everyone but yourself? 

We can't expect ourselves to be superheroes, or to know everything, or to be able to predict the future. Please don't be too hard on yourself regarding your mother's death. You deserve compassion, too. ",SuicideWatch,0
"If you kill yourself today, nobody will remember you 1000 years from now. 10,000 years from now, almost certainly nobody alive today will be remembered in any fashion. 1,000,000 years from now that is an absolute certainty. 1,000,000,000 years from now, planet Earth won't even be hospitable and all traces of humanity will be gone. 1,000,000,000,000 years from now, the Universe will be well on its way to heat death and almost all stars will have dimmed to the point of not even emitting visible light. 

The point is that nothing - no matter how small or big - matters. No matter how badly you have fucked up, no matter how financially fucked you are, no matter the people you've alienated, the wrong things you've said to people, the mistakes you've made - none of that will matter. 

What does matter is that you live your life to the fullest and fight through the anguish.

"Yeah, I understand that, until this day I don't feel confortable at all talking about my sexuality unless it's with my best friend (that I've met na came out online and that I til' this day have a crush on to be honest), having one person that is understanding is enough, you don't have to talk about your sexuaity if you're not confortable, until this day I have some close friends that have no idea I'm bi (I'm 19), but I couldn't care less, the most important thing is to accept yourself.
I mean, I was about 15 when I found out what was up with my sexuality, and it took me a pretty long time to accept it, so what I'm trying to say is that if you give yourself some time you will see that it's completely ok to be who you are, no matter what (unless you are a murderer, don't be a murderer).
Life is hard, don't bring yourself down, there are plenty of people who care for you and will be there for you no matter what. Let other people try to bring you down, and then tell them to go fuck themselves.

If you need someone to talk to I'm here. I'd love to listen to your rambling some more. I like listening to people's stories. And the most reserved people often have the most interesting tales to tell.
I'm glad you're seeing a therapist. I didn't have that luxury but I bet it helps a lot. What helped me was having a friend who was thousands of miles away who I didn't know personally. Because I could tell them anything and everything. I bet you figured that out too in that 1 year.
And I think you should tell your boyfriend. Keeping it from him will only make it worse if he finds out. And he'll blame himself, thinking he's part of the cause, since you didn't tell him.

I would like to find professional help, but there is only one place in my vicinity that offers income based help, and unfortunately, I have a somewhat negative personal connection with the woman that does the initial assessments. And my current income doesn't really allow me to seek out other avenues. As I said, a $15 meal takes financial planning in my current state. So professional help isn't really affordable, and my job has shit insurance. 

I'm not really ""on the edge"", I just think about suicide a lot as it feels that all avenues for a happy future have been blocked.   I can't recognize the triggers for why I feel this way, but don't know how to turn it around.

Sometimes to the point that I run romantic partners off because I start to feel that they will leave me at any moment.

"It's okay don't worry about it, I've actually been feeling better than usual for the past few days. That'll end soon though, it always does - I just took the opportunity to write out these notes that I didn't have the energy to do before. I'm shocked I've made it through these past 3-4 months that have been just terrible and if it gets that bad again I'm pretty sure I'm going to kill myself. So, here's to hoping that these notes don't have to get sent out till I die of natural causes I guess.

My family doesn't know and I can't open up to them because we're just very different. My family is very religious and has a very strong cultural conservative background, they won't understand me or my problems and will attempt to insert Jesus or religion in my life because that it their version of a miracle cure that can solve any problem. I don't want to be the catalyst for them questioning their faith because that is a different problem to deal with and at least with religion they worry a lot less about death and other difficult to deal with topics that religion seemingly provides an answer to. I have a friend I can confide in but it's complicated - I also cannot really talk to her about my problems because I realize that if you're not depressed it's difficult to empathize and it can be just TOO much to deal with. So, I've accepted that I'll likely kill myself at some point in my life and that things are unlikely to get better for me and that's okay. As I said earlier, I'm actually not feeling terrible right now but it seems like my periods of feeling okay last for shorter periods of time each time they roll around and if my last depressive phase is any indication of things to come well, I am a bit scared but it is what it is.
