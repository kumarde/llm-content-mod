"**TL;DR:**  Type in ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ for proper formatting

Actual reply:

For the 

    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

like you were trying for you need three backslashes, so it should look like this when you type it out

    ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

which will turn out like this

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

The reason for this is that the underscore character (this one \_ ) is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does (this guy \* ).  Since the ""face"" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the ""face"" (this guy (ツ) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first ""\\_"" is just saying ""hey, I don't want to italicize (ツ)"" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol

***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***

Edit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \_italicize\_ or \*italicize\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\_italicize\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\\\_/¯ but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.",Android,1

"To quote [an Android Police article that sums up what Google says](http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/07/20/google-explains-chrome-will-become-webview-android-7-0/):

""Android has long provided a way for developers to show web content in apps without implementing a full browser with WebView, but the nature of this component has changed a lot over the years. It became Chromium-powered, was unbundled from the system, and then got a beta channel. Starting in Android 7.0 Nougat, WebView will actually be Chrome.


For Chrome to handle WebView rendering, you'll need to be on v51 or higher with Android 7.0. The default behavior in this instance will be for the Chrome APK on your device to render Android System WebViews. Google says this is more memory-efficient than using the current WebView. The standalone WebView APK will no longer be updated via the Play Store as long as the Chrome rendering remains enabled on your device.

Should you want to change the WebView rendering mode, that will be in developer options under ""WebView implementation."" You can choose between and v51 or higher build of Chrome (stable, beta, dev) on your device or the regular WebView APK.""

On an unrelated note, it seems a mod here has a mixed understanding of what qualifies as ""blog spam"". I originally posted the AP article as a reddit post and it was removed because the article [is blog spam](http://i.imgur.com/X2Kd6nF.png), of which the mod was responding to [my appeal of the post removal](http://i.imgur.com/CwtlmNl.png)

"Nexus 5.

a removable battery

current one is basically dead and dont want to take it apart to put in a new one. ",Android,0
"&gt; A lot of people on this sub love removable batteries, but I have never met anyone who would carry around an extra battery on them. 

Why wouldn't one? I do that every time I leave the house for an extended time since my first smartphone in 2009.

&gt;  There are better alternatives to a removable battery like a portable battery since you can get more than 1 charge and share it with your friends. 

Portable batteries are on average way bigger and more importantly massively heavier than a spare internal battery, not even counting the needed cable. An internal battery is still thin enough that don't really notice it when you put them in an empty front pocket. This for example is the size of a battery from the Galaxy S5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjn_Eda8l1s

And of course an external battery will not charge your phone instantly, even one that supports fast charging would take more than an hour. How are they even useful? When I am on foot I would need to have my phone connected with a cable to the battery inside another pocket, which sounds hardly comfortable. When I am in the car I could just use the car charger and when I am at someone else house or the office I could use a wall charger as well. 

With an swapable internal battery I can fully charge the phone from 0 to 100 in less than a minute. And 90% of that is waiting for the phone to shutdown and boot back up. And carrying one in your pocket is at least as comfortable than the cable you need for the external battery alone.",Android,0

THIS THIS THIS. There is little to zero difference between an iPhone 7 and a 6P running the exact same top 25 apps (aside from snapchat because snap inc doesnt give two shits about android). I'm not arguing the iPhone is lesser. Its a great piece of hardware period. The A10 is a great chip. What I am arguing is why we care so much about a benchmark when most of us talking in this sub are here for the power android provides us, skinning, root, custom roms, a file system, usb storage, ability to change default apps, no walled garden (amazon store, this sub's own new store, play store etc.) 

Please instead of downvoting me first argue why Qualcomm is so pathetic if matching the A10 performance is virtually unnecessary for them? Its not necessarily what you have its how you use it. Android with an 821 could be made to sing and appear as smooth as an iPhone 7.

"It does what it realistically should: be a competitor to the iPhone (And Samsung) but the fact that Google is running it's own customized android skin says a lot about where Google wants to go with Android, even before going to Andromeda. 

Google is moving away from ""Stock Android"" and making the statement that Android is just the basic OS, and is meant to be skinned on top. I hope this means they can transition to Andromeda, and provide updates to the software without jumping through the hoops of carriers and OEMs. But stock Android as we know it won't necessarily be the same anymore. Google looks to be changing the rules of the game. And I hope that means they can do major things with Allo and Duo and unify through Chrome what Apple has done on Macs. 

I know this community really doesn't want to hear this, but I have a strong feeling this is where Google is going. But the major OEM skins of Android are getting cleaner and lighter. I've heard positive things about the new Note 7 Android skin, SenseUI has always been very minimal for a long time, LG is getting cleaner too (I personally have only two or three complaints with the current software on my G5, and all but one will be addressed in their skin of Nougat) and the only phones with the most egregious of skins are usually Chinese phones.

This would just be the multi-core scores, in principle; this is the amount of stuff the CPU can do _in ideal circumstances_, with all these cores.

It would be much more efficient to have end-to-end digital and then convert to analog at the output, which incidentally is exactly how wireless headphones do it now, or to use a DAC between the source and the output jack, which is how 3.5mm jacks work.

Nobody with a brain in their head would use a USB cable in the exact same way as a 3.5mm jack, because it would be an inefficient use of the data transfer pipeline. You'd be using 24 connectors to transfer 2 streams of data. Super inefficient.

"According to the leak, Andromeda running on phones is just speculation. In fact, based on what Android Police said, it's most likely not even meant to run on phones, but on bigger devices like tablets and laptops.

""1. Andromeda will apparently run on anything: phones, tablets, laptops, but we pretty much assumed that""

So yeah, I believe Andromeda won't debut on phones, an here's why:

1. Changing completely the OS of a consumer device is a bad idea. That's like expecting Microsoft to suddenly force you to upgrade and install a different Operating System from which you can't opt out.  And no, Windows 10 is not a different OS.

2. Unless they are going to help all OEMs switch to Andromeda promptly (and you know that's pretty much impossible), they can't abandon Android from the get-go. They will have to continue support Android further until everyone is ready to switch.

3. The Twitter leak mentions that current devices won't get it. Unless the Pixel devices launch with Andromeda, it's very likely they won't receive Andromeda either. Plus the first point I mentioned. From your assumption, I should take that they will abandon the Pixel devices as soon as they launch Andromeda on their new flagships. Given that Andromeda is believed to launch sometime in Q3 2017, should we believe Google won't support Android from next year? Do you realise how stupid that would be?",Android,0

Now you want to watch your movie on a bigger screen, like a monitor, which only has a VGA input (or you only have a VGA adapter). Turns out you're not able to do this, because iTunes forces you to use HDCP, which isn't supported by VGA.

Or you recently bought a 4K monitor for your desktop, connect your PS4 Pro to it and now you want to watch a 4K movie from Netflix. Turns out you can't, because your 4K monitor doesn't support HDCP 2.2, which is required to be supported because you might be an evil pirate who may want to capture the video output of the console. Now the sad thing with this example is that currently many 4K monitors on the market don't support HDCP 2.2, even though they have HDMI 2.0, meaning that if you want to watch 4K movies on your monitor, you need to buy a new one... or you just watch an illegal release, which doesn't contain any of this crap.

Now imagine the same thing happens with audio. Want to listen to Spotify from your phone on your Hi-Fi setup? Your receiver better supports HDCP (or any other DRM technology in use), because otherwise you might be able to record the stream and listen to the track after your subscription is expired.


The point is that many DRM solutions limit your possibilities to experience content just because companies want to stop you proactively from copying their stuff by forcing you to use ""compliant"" equipment even if it isn't your intention at all to copy anything.

In the end you, the legitimate customer, have to deal with all the restrictions of DRM even though you legally bought a copy/own a subscription for a streaming service while pirates (after DRM is cracked) just download the title for free, laugh and enjoy media the way they want to, without any restrictions.


**TL;DR:** DRM fucks with the legitimate users while pirates don't have to deal with it at all after it has been cracked (which most of the time doesn't take that long).

"&gt; It's a bit misleading to look at single core scores when these platforms make such good use of multi-core.

Do they though? Most apps are single threaded, and the entire Android UI is single threaded.",Android,0

There's no release without a battery drain bug or a memory leak. I wonder what those 4 betas are for.,Android,0
The Type C port does take up way less space than the 3.5mm port which is huge on the inside. So dual Type C is definitely more space efficient than what we have now.,Android,0
