Nice try, George ""If-you're-not-with-us,-you're-with-the-terrorists"" Bush.

you have a rather short memory of history if you think George Bush was the first person to think that appeasement would fail. this is a strawman of the first order...since george bush never talked about ""appeasing"" hussein. it seems like the original commenter was referencing Chamberlain at Munich.

"THIS IS WHY WE CANNOT ALLOW ISLAMIC REFUGEES INTO OUR NATIONS!!!

There are NO peacful Muslims. ONLY varying degrees of patience. BUT, all have the same goal.

FACT: Islam and Sharia Law are 180° opposite from American and UK values, traditions and our Constitutions.

FACT: Sharia is the religious law governing the members of the Islamic faith. It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the Quran and the Hadith.

FACT: Sharia Law demands that it be the only law.

FACT: Sharia Law requires the elimination of our Constitution and all federal, state and local laws.

FACT: Sharia Law requires the elimination of all non-Muslims unless they convert to Islam.

FACT: Sharia Law is treasonous and seditious under our Constitution and laws.

FACT: And then there is Islam's secret: Hijra ... jihad by immigration….immigrate and take over by population expansion.

FACT: Reports say 2 to 3 ISIS terrorists and 12 people sympathetic to radical Islam are likely to infiltrate the Europe for each 100 ""refugees"" is on the list of top ten reasons to not allow waves of Muslim and Syrian/Iraqi immigration.

FACT: According to the UN, 72% of the so called ""Refugees"" are men 40 and younger. Only 13% are children....AND, there is no way to vet them.

FACT: Poll after poll, of Muslims everywhere, show that they are sympathetic to the goals of ISIS and al-Qaeda.

FACT: Sharia Law is why Muslims DO NOT assimilate well into Western culture.

FACT: Everywhere Muslims have immigrated or resettled as refugees, they have established Sharia Law and their own courts…in defiance of host countries’ laws.

FACT: In England, Muslims have set up 85+ Sharia Law courts...against English laws...80% of Muslim marriages are not recognized by English law.

FACT: Muslims do NOT WANT to assimilate…Take a look at Europe. If anything, ""No go"" zones in some places…and the mayhem and rapes perpetrated by Muslim refugees across Europe.

FACT: Muslim refugees don't want to be Americans either and have NO idea or care for our laws and way of life. They just want to continue life as Muslims and follow Sharia law…They have absolutely no intention to be integrated into the America.

FACT: Case after case of young Muslim men in the UK and America have been siding with ISIS…proving these Muslims living in the UK and here are not loyal citizens.

FACT: Islamic ideology is to rid the world of NON-MUSLIMS. If you doubt, read the Koran. It is written.

FACT: Muslims conquer when they can. If they cannot conquer, they try to integrate . . . until it is time to conquer.

FACT: We Americans have NO responsibility to let anybody into our country. Yet, no country has taken in more refugees and immigrants.

WHY allow immigration or refugee status to groups trying to take way our freedoms and completely erase us from the earth?

"America could end the Syrian conflict if they stopped funding the rebels, you're retarded if you think Russia is the sole bad guy in that situation. A similar thing can be said about Ukraine, the separatists didn't want to be annexed by the EU, but Russia is evil for supporting them, whereas the west is the good guy because we're helping them become annexed by us (we're of course, always morally righteous). Use your brain, these conflicts are about more than just ""we good, Russia bad"", so many undeserving families have been devastated by war, mostly because of events we have set into motion.

My personal view on Syria is that it's best if the war simply ends with Assad staying in power. If we want people to have access to hospitals, simply stop the rebels from fighting. Their only cause now is religious, and thousands of people are dying because of it. It's madness, if they simply accepted Assad's amnesty en masse no one else would have to die, and injured civilians would be able to receive treatment.

"some may think that this is an act of radical islamism...

no. just islam. these kind of activities (music, alcohol, mixed gender gatherings, dancing etc.) are forbidden in islam, and anyone who doesn't comply with islam's rules should be punished. 

problem is, these people who play muslim have no idea on what islam is and islam feeds on this navity. and when the day comes, islam bites the very people who tolerated it. 

anyone who does not care to know what islam is will inevitably be bitten by it. people of turkey are now meeting the islam, which they have been avoiding unknowingly thanks to secular basis the country sat on. but not anymore. tolerating islam and muslims corrupted that basis and allowing muslims to government accelerated the downfall. 

quran clearly says: (5:33,34) Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment,Except for those who return [repenting] before you apprehend them. And know that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

islam mentality: if you don't obey islam's rules, you are waging war against allah and his messenger and causing corruption on earth. 
or as stated  in quran: (5:44) ... And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed - then it is those who are the disbelievers.

"The idea that it is ok to ""spy on everyone"" in Detroit is just stupid. 

Oh, fuck it. The truth is that the world is a seething mob of disparate interests, most of which are perfectly ok with pointing fingers at others without so much as a look in the mirror.

I'm from Detroit, so it is likely that I'm biased. Yet the truth is that Detroit is one of the most racially segregated cities in the nation. It is an insidious segregation enforced mainly through economics. This segregation is mutually reinforced by the weird Motor City pride that decided to forgo sensible public transit in exchange for freedom in the form of every person owning a car and forever jobs in an industry that just could not or would not live up to that promise. The end result is a weird segregated city that shows itself most honestly in a public school system so broken that a judge literally ruled that students in DPS have no right to an education that fundamentally provides the resources to educate students to the most basic levels of literacy. The true nature of this is also the mindset  responsible for the water ""problem"" in Flint, which began not with the Emergency Manager debacle, but rather with the reason why the Flint river is contaminated almost beyond repair. The question of how and why that river is so contaminated is never even addressed.

Nevertheless, the majority of murders in Detroit are committed by one racial group. The suggestion that we spy on only that racial group would not go over well, to say the least. And yet, it would not be a bad policy if one were to examine it with an eye toward massively reducing murder and other ancillary violent crimes. Though this completely ignores the downward trend in violent crimes, including murder over the past 25-30 years.

Now applying this to international terrorism, that is terrorism that is perpetrated by one or myriad groups of nationalities sharing a common characteristic (religion) against states they have either adopted as immigrants or states that have accepted them as refugees. I'm sorry if you're a member of a group that is responsible for an overwhelming proportion of certain misdeeds, but our goal is to prevent the misdeeds. With or without the assistance of the majority of that group that does not commit said misdeeds. And to be clear, various actors aligned with the ideology of Islam perpetrate the overwhelming majority of terrorism. (The argument that certain Nationstates commit terrorism as policy can skew this debate, and I consider this a legitimate point. I'm speaking here of the US, UK and Israel. But putting that aside...) 

Tying all this together, I must admit that were I a black man from Detroit, I'd be looking to kill whitey all motherfuckin day, every day. Assuming that I could recognize the self loathing that has literally been bred into me in much the same way that superior genetic material was bred into me for several hundred years when my forbears were merely the property of others, to do with as my owners deemed fit.

As with black Americans, the underlying causes of why Muslims worldwide are in the position in which they find themselves are terribly complex, and appear to center upon resources.

It's a fucking mess. All I know is that I belong to that group of people that just want to watch the forest burn, to borrow a phrase from pop culture. This shit has been coming for some time. Many of us cared more for this message than most anything else.

If the government ain't spying on me, they ought to be. The fact that they spy on EVERYONE is prima facie that it's too fucking late. The only thing left is the boot. The only tool left in the box.

"I was 18 a decade ago. And while I did manage to secure some form of temporary employment at that time, it was because I was the exception, not the norm. I did software development. Most of my peers didn't have any skills which could be used in any way whatsoever... maybe manual labor, promotions, or working at cafes, but that's about it.

I'm not implying they're stupid or dumb, but believe it or not, most 18 year olds don't know what they're going to do with their life at that point. They may secure a job like I did, but even my job wasn't stable nor profitable. It can't be stable or profitable since at that point in time I thought with my dick a lot, and I was juggling between work and school, and any job for a kid like me was most likely temporary.

My dad started working when he was 18 and worked his way up in that same company, but stuff like that is really rare nowadays.

Anyway, I'd rather have 18 year olds travel a bit and find themselves, find out what they want to do with their life and find new opportunities. Staying at home and shelling up is the worst thing one can do, and many of my peers did so, and they're in their 30s - jobless and clueless.",worldnews,0

"Filipino here, living in the city where he came from. A lot of people are starting to hate him, even the ''poor'' who initially supported him. Just rode a taxi  earlier when news of this came up on the radio and the driver was really mad at him. Im not talking about disappointment, like he was really really angry and he said a lot of people feel sorry that they supported him :/ 

Luckily you can only be elected president once... unless of course he does something about that too.... 

edit: its past midnight and i cant respond to everyone, sorry!! but the gist of it is that 1. they're all for getting rid of the drug problem but they didn't know they were signing up for a slaughtering of addicts or even just people suspected of drug use. 2. they don't like that the big time drug lords are to be granted parole 3. they don't like how he is cozying up to the local communist group and china and attacking the US/other allies when ''he couldve just shut up''.  (they = people ive talked to or heard from. its a favourite topic in my peer group.)

and to the person concerned about what i talk to to cab drivers, thank you for the reminder. but as my original post said, the news came up and he started ranting. it rouses up really strong feelings from many of the locals since he's been the lead figure here for like 30 years so some people just cant help it. 

as for crime rates, i honestly can't tell if there is any improvement.  the police do seem very enthusiastic with doing their work but that just opens another can of worms like 1. neglecting to do their job properly because they know the president would have their back completely (he has said the police should just do what they do and not be afraid to get sued because he will answer for it :/ )2. police brutality/abuse of power. 


edit 2: most of my peers voted for him mainly because he is from mindanao. one of his campaign slogans was ""bisaya na pud"" which i'd roughly  translate to mean that its time a ""bisaya"" (person who speaks the local dialect thats also generally called bisaya lol) to be president. they assumed it would be the ""change"" they had hoped for without really thinking if that change was for the greater good or not.

So a 20-something year old who was trained by the US in the 1980s could well be 50-something year old leading ISIS fighter now. Technically still ""US trained"". But its not like the US trained them to become ISIS fighters.

It made it clear that while I technically have a right to live and work anywhere in the EU, in practice the language barriers prevent me from doing so. And I came away with a much stronger sense of national identity rather than an EU identity.

The one thing that would achieve a common sense of belonging to Europe is to ensure that everyone has one common language and that you're entitled to the state services in that language everywhere in Europe.

Not only that but their rapid global movement spread disease from different parts of the world. The initial Chinese invasion by mongols did not depopulate china, it was when diseases were brought from the conquest in east Europe that caused China's population to decreased so rapidly. 

That's not to say the Mongols weren't horrifically brutal, but the death toll from them directly likely doesn't go past 5-6 million.

Druggies lying on the public concrete floor all day a lot are not even wearing upper clothes. Etcetera, etcetera. This isn't like in richer countries where I heard people who smoke or do it just usually stay in their rooms or somewhere. You also have to take into consideration the insane poverty here.


\&gt;flipping burgs is $8/day

\&gt;finish your 4-5 college degree, starting salaries are $220 for a lot of fields


People will do insane things especially if they're already too deep into it, and people are so used to breaking the law because the previous administrations pampers them.""

Killing them mercilessly for the garbage they are is the best way to fix the problem and unite the people against this menace. Kids will grow up with extreme aversion to drugs and will look up to Duterte. It will be glorious.",worldnews,0

"You are correct. The Boomers have abrogated the tradition of passing wealth down through generations by changing rules. They are all about me, me and me with a side of 'my entitlements' 

But.

Soon all these egomaniacal and narcissistic Boomers are going to be in the position of HAVING to purchase 'personal services' of every sort imaginable, usually after a health 'event' or scare. 

Their poorly cared for bodies (witness the 2/3 overweight and 1/3 obese stats) are breaking down and their indoctrinated minds refuse to allow them to give up burdensome properties that carry massive maintenance fees, or a lifetime of accumulated possessions of questionable value. They simply cannot see the shit as the encumbrance it is.

And therein lies the win. For a while. 

Remember this is just age momentum and does not account for financial 'events' like the massive corporate theft of American wealth aka The 2007 Meltdown. I know multiple Boomers who lost their ass in that that kleptocratic corporate capture of the US of the mortgage regulatory industry. 

So while their kids got to think they were 'rich' growing up, guess what? Your parents were actually financially 'busted' in that legalized corporate theft from middle class America. Guess who they expect to take care of them now? It's either their children or their government, which are eventually the same person.

Shortly after that it all goes to shit a la Chicago as the Boomers are forced to abandon independent living but have fucked up the financial system so badly that the next generation can't afford to buy homes.

The '20's and '30's are gonna be a wild ride

I continue to be greeted with ""contact business"" where people do not give a fuck about details, if you're a friend of a friend or you've been recommended, they skip even the most high qualified person on the list. Developing contacts online is a tad bit easier than in real life so it works for me.
