"You don't need to offer a shiny, but you should definitely offer something of decent value. Starters are very easily breedable and everyone will have hundreds of them.

My recommendation is to trade for other unique pokemons. Island guardians, legendaries, other mystic tier pokemon, or a pokemon that is very difficult to get like ones via sos chaining in specific whether conditions.

Also, Jirachi isn't as valued as Celebi to some people. 3) The hardest event to get currently, in my opinion, is the Volcanion event, as it can only be redeemed with a code from Japan. 4) In game, it would be Volcarona, since it evolves really late and is extremely hard to leave up, because Larvesta is really weak. 5) No, but you can get it via the long range trainer glitch.",pokemontrades,1

What you mention, I can trade:

* Scrap Eevee (male)
* Mewtwo
* Genesect too if I get deal with trade partner for KOR Shiny Genesect

Since Eevee was redeemed for me by friend, proof has her Naver and Twitter ID. Mewtwo and Genesect are self-obtained but no proof, but if I get KOR Genesect it will have proof (I think). I do not know if I will get Genesect or when.
