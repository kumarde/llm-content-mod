Campus coddling is the University of Toronto threatening to remove Peterson from teaching because he refuses to accept the war on language being waged by the left in this country.

Campus coddling is the Yale University student who fucking cries when her dorm masters wife tells people to wear whatever halloween costumes they want. 

Campus coddling is when universities bring in dogs to console students a day after they lost an election fair and square, it is when they stage protests to block off entrances to schools because they are cry babies, it is when they hold a group crying session in the middle of campus to cry together and hug one another when they lost an election. 

Campus coddling is when a Muslim professor in Ontario berates a student who simply says the Professor is being unfair. 

Campus coddling is when people like you bitch about not getting free gibs me dat abortions because you were too stupid to be safe or, people like you who bitch about not having enough money so you deserve other people's hard earned money.

The owner is assuming his ""joke"" is why his contract was terminated

>“On Dec. 12, the WLUGSA [Wilfrid Laurier University Graduate Students’ Association] terminated its third-party contract agreement with the provider who serviced Veritas Café. We invoked clause 3.2.3.3 in our contract, which states that: “conduct on the part of the Service Provider that is materially detrimental to the Business or would injure the reputation of the WLUGSA as determined by the sole discretion of the WLUGSA” shall be grounds for immediate termination. Veritas Café will be closed while we consider how best to move forward. We understand the community could be impacted by this closure. However, the WLUGSA remains committed to providing services that align with Laurier community values and we will continue to work to do so in a proactive manner.”

"Let's see.

Median family income is $76,550.

Median housing price is much harder to find as Canada likes to use mean for some reason. Unfortunately, the extreme prices in Vancouver and Toronto, which only make up about 20% of the homes, are going to skew the mean in some pretty strange ways. I'm going to assume the median price is $250,000.

I could not find the median family spending either, but I'm going to assume $45,000, which is about $10K under than the mean. I think that's fairly reasonable, as the wealthiest families are apt to skew the numbers again.

If we do a quick and dirty tax calculation, the family will have about $60,000 after taxes, and $15,000 after expenses. 10% of $250,000 is $25,000. That means the median family can cover the down payment in under two years, if my assumptions are true. I welcome real values if you can find them.",canada,1

"**Further unconfirmed details/updates**

https://archive.is/u2Hex -- archive of the FB page that I made. 


Before it was deleted, the alleged FB profile of Alexandre Bissonnette had a guy tag his friend on it saying ''And to say you slept with the guy.'' And the tagged friend answered ''What can I say, I like bad boys.'' Another guy chimed in: ''I hope you were out of the closet ;)''

So his other ''likes'' may include ''gay sex'', according to that comment.

Some community members of the mosque say that Mohamed Khadir (Arab guy) was also gay, but closeted. Alexandre Bissonette was apparently recently out of the closet.

Alexandre Bissonette's Facebook page likes included Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen, Megadeth, Israeli Defense Forces, Chris Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, Party Quebecois (nationalist separatist party that tried to introduce an anti-Muslim charter a year ago). 



So far, it's looking like they tried to take revenge on the mosque for not approving of their homosexual relationship + the Arab guy seemed like an exMuslim Arab since he had anti-islam posts on his FB (rumor unconfirmed). The white guy was definitely just anti-Islam, nothing to do with converts.

He also liked feminist page(s) on FB (i confirmed 1 page at least),so that might be related since many feminists are anti-religion, especially islam

**So far, looks like 2 pissed rightwing pro-Trump/pro-marine le pen homosexual lovers taking it out on a mosque for rejecting their gay  love** 

Some of you will be pissed that I'm repeating unconfirmed stuff, but this passes the Occam's Razor test for me. And I'm sure most of you appreciate me collating the information related to this shit since the media is doing a horrible job.

We invoked clause 3.2.3.3 in our contract, which states that: “conduct on the part of the Service Provider that is materially detrimental to the Business or would injure the reputation of the WLUGSA as determined by the sole discretion of the WLUGSA” shall be grounds for immediate termination. Veritas Café will be closed while we consider how best to move forward. We understand the community could be impacted by this closure.

Take a fucking reading comprehension course.

I never said ""the question was settled""  I said racial tensions and serious incidents of mass racial violence dropped immensely during the 70s, stayed at a much lower occurance rate throughout the 80s, 90s, and 2000s, and have gone up radically in the last years of Obama's term.

Go fuck yourself. You don't get to tell every LGBT person what Pride is supposed to be for them. For me, Pride is *not* a protest. What the hell are we protesting? For me, it's a celebration. A celebration of the communities we've built, the bridges we've built with other communities, the legal rights we've gained, the social acceptance we've gained, the social progress we've made.

For me, Pride is celebrating a victory. *We won.*

Also: I don't want police to wear normal street clothes because their uniforms might ""trigger"" an overly-sensitive special snowflake. I want them in their uniforms, marching with us, in a show of solidarity for all the world to see that Law Enforcement and LGBT people have worked hard for decades to build a bridge of mutual understanding and respect for one another. Is it perfect? No. No relationship ever is, but we have made significant progress and the fact that the police *want* to be part of our celebration speaks volumes about how they feel about us and our community.

If these special snowflake SJWs want to have their own pity party somewhere else, then they're welcome to. It is not their place, however, to tell the rest of the LGBT community how to have Pride, who's allowed to participate, and what it means to us.

Liberalism is a political philosophy or worldview founded on ideas of ***liberty*** and equality https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism

People don't want to pay taxes to increase military spending overseas, but do people even know how terrible the system is? I find not, they are shocked with they find out about the state of our planes and helicopters.

They don't know that when service members are posted there isn't always enough military housing to support them if they can't afford to purchase a home or there isn't adequate rental housing.

By all means educate the public on what happened, who served and why. Gets vets into schools, send kids to Vimy, Juno and Dieppe (you get the idea) but re-naming one park because people on the other side of town voted to re-name one of their parks seems a bit childish to me, and I don't think that's an appropriate way to honour anyone. The park that is to become Vimy Park is already known to locals by a completely different name, and is mostly used recreationally. In other words, it's not a place of quiet contemplation and remembrance. Very much the opposite and the locals weren't even asked. It's political football and vets/remembrance are being used by politicians simply looking to get re-elected (the new Vimy Park is in a slightly more federalist riding than the old one, which used to be a sovereignist stronghold... it's tit-for-tat nonsense that uses Vimy Ridge for short-term political gain).

"1) No I don't even know how you got that from any of my examples. That's actually so incoherent I re-read it and my comment many times and still have no idea what you're even *trying* to convey.

2) Yeah, that *should* have been enough for this guy too. But it wasn't. And that's not the situation we're talking about. At all. He decided to publicly deny this persons gender and the very existence of the phenomenon of transgenderism despite all evidence pointing to the contrary and all attempts to stop arguing with the person about their own gender. At a certain point it becomes hate speech, which is not protected under our constitution for good reason. No one is going to take someone to court for accidentally saying ""she"" when they meant ""they"". That happens all the time and trans people are used to it. What I would like to see people taken to court for is a pointed insistence to humiliate someone by continuing to misgender them after they've been corrected. With any civil rights movement in Canada, there is a certain point where disagreement turns into hate speech. It's up to the courts to decide where to draw the line on that one, and this case will clarify where that line is drawn. Personally, it's clear to me that this guy is very close to crossing that line if he hasn't already.

3) He didn't say ""transgender people don't exist"" but he definitely said transgenderism doesn't exist. Go back and listen to his interview. He then proceeds to throw a temper tantrum about how he ""never said transgender people don't exist"" which, frankly, is just splitting hairs. Ok, dumbass, we believe that you never said the physical people standing in front of you don't exist. You just said none of their experiences or struggles or gender identities exist which is a very close approximation to ""transgender people don't exist"".",canada,0

"Okay so I have a question. Why is the gain on the sale of your primary residence tax-exempt in the first place?

We have a system where you can borrow money for next to nothing, leverage your savings 20:1, and enjoy a tax free gain on whatever you make. Of course people are going to use this as their primary investment vehicle. This is what causes people to flip homes, living in them only long enough to fix them up and sell them for a massive gain.

20:1 leverage, 20% a year gains, decoupling of the ability to service the debt from incomes. Does it not seem completely irresponsible and risky to anyone else that I'm describing the roof over your family's head?

Try going to a bank and asking for 20:1 leverage so you can buy (insert anything here... stocks, mutual funds, whatever). They'll laugh at you. And you'll be taxed on the gains. This makes few people try this, and for good reason.

If we cut down on the investment gains so that the largest source of utility a person gets out of a house is shelter, people will start treating houses as shelter and not as government-subsidized investments.

We should come up with a system that makes it as cheap as possible (ie zero fees/taxes) for someone to own a house, but more expensive for them to profit off of it, and even more expensive if their only intention of owning that house is to profit from its sale.

I guess that would depend on the specifics of the plan since if the dog runs into the road then they might not cover it. But if it's something like the dog was sitting there and a car drove over it's tail, then the dog isn't at fault. There's also tonnes of other possibilities other than the dog attack that you ignored like a knife slipping out of your hand, accidentally stepping on your dog's feet, a branch falling down after a storm or something (I remember in 2013 after the winter storm some of the tree branches were damaged in the storm and had heavy icicles and it wouldn't have surprised me if one of them fell and injured a person let alone a dog).

Unions and the labour movement is needed now more than ever.

Athletes don't work in coal mines, writers, actors, post office workers, teachers, etc don't work in coal mines. 

The problem is that unionizing was never fought in most of the service industries that replaced manufacturing. Our grand and great grandparents fought (literally) for shorter work weeks, longer vacation, benefits, pension, etc, but we stopped fighting long ago and as the new industries replaced the old we naively expected the same benefits.

"I grew up in Nova Scotia right through Acadian University and the Technical University of Nova Scotia before moving to Ottawa for grad school. It was great then, but yes from the 80s and 90s, young people (like me) tended to leave to find better jobs and opportunities. This was partly because of the collapse of fishing, coal mining, farming moving to mega-corporations, oil &amp; gas jobs out West, and general urbanization where the opportunities and infrastructure was, with few urban centers.

My family is still there, and I happen to work for an agency that deals with growing small and medium companies nationally, so I'm aware what's going on there (and have visited and advised companies). There is certainly some very interesting growth areas.

If I had to summarize now, I'd say Atlantic has some of the greatest growth potential and we're seeing it. The move from traditional industries and manual labour has stabilized. The infrastructure of high-speed internet is still underway but covers a lot of the smaller towns and rural communities. 

Given the general growth of the information economy that includes working from home, remotely, virtual offices and companies, and ability to work from anywhere -- there is no reason you can't run successful businesses from Atlantic Canada.

And, the scenery is still gorgeous and you can get mansions on the water for the price of a condo in Toronto or Vancouver or a townhome/semi-detached in other cities like Ottawa or Montreal. Plus Halifax and St. John's have international airports and are along major routes between Europe and Canada and even the U.S.

Nova Scotia in particular also still has the highest number of universities per capita in the country, I believe.

Education, beautiful homes and locations at low prices, and ability to run businesses from them, and easy international access via shipping and flights. It's well situated for great success in the emerging/growing economy. The draw of oil out West has also mostly ceased.

Correct.

&gt;The non-speculator foreigners comprise of such a small amount of transactions (maybe up to 5%)

I've seen stats where it was estimated at ~30%.

&gt;In the Greater Vancouver Area, they estimate Chinese investors spent $12.7-billion – or 33 per cent of total sales. That figure, they say, lines up with research from B.C. urban planner Andy Yan, who found that 66 per cent of all sales of 172 detached homes in three west-side Vancouver neighbourhoods within a six-month period were to buyers with non-Anglicized Chinese names.

The janitors who keep our toilets sanitary, the engineers who make sure our bridges don't fall, the architects who make sure we don't live in a Soviet hell and the garbage men who make sure our cities don't stink all do valuable work. Don't try this BS where teachers are some how magically special people who somehow deserve to be above competing for salaries like the rest of us do. In the private sector, one doesn't *demand* a salary. One requests a salary, and if it is determined that one's labour is of sufficient value, said salary is paid (or employee quits and finds an employer who is willing to pay them more). If it isn't, an employer is free to find someone willing and able to do the job for less. Labour is *sold* at a market price. Don't pretend that happens with teachers. An uncompetitive 2 year university degree and [2/3rds of graduates who can't find work](http://www.macleans.ca/work/jobs/two-thirds-of-new-teachers-cant-find-full-time-work/) indicate that teachers are grossly overpaid.
